      "Hi guys,Ben from BuyAHash.com I am curious about this, as I've been in talks with a few people. Stores are mostly sold out of GPUs, or there are limits on what you can buy. I may have a way to purchase cards direct from the factory. The cards wouldn't be labeled nor have official warranties, but they are from OEM manufacturers like MSI, Sapphire, and the like. The idea would be to maybe go in and purchase 500 - 1000 to negotiate a favorable price. I am not sure what the actual costs are going to be, but they'd be below NewEgg prices, but wouldn't include the AMD promo cards. My estimate (and please do not quote me) would be about $250 + S&H per GPU in the US. Payments would be via crypto and credit cards. Would this be something that BitcoinTalk users would be interested in?\n",

      "Depends on how fast delivery will be. With dedicated scrypt machines coming out soon (hopefully), gpu mining may not be viable unless rigs are up and running very quickly.Specs of the card would need to be figured out as well, since certain cards do much better than others due to mfg specific implementations that are beyond the scope of the reference design.\n",

Anyway if someone has a copy of it or has a link to get it, it would be greatly appreciated.By the way, I know that it comes packaged with catalyst 11.3-11.6, but this does not work for me as every time I install it, the sdk defaults to version 2.7, even though I uninstalled catalyst 12.8 prior to installing 11.6 and also removed amdocl and opencl from my system32 folder. For some reason when I install sdk through the catalyst package files it defaults to 2.7, but when I install sdk from the standalone installer it works fine.

      "^^ ditto.Just place the delta/wye step down xmfrs at the end of each aisle along with their required distribution breaker panels and feed each xmfr with a run from the 480V main panel feeding the delta side. Makes it nice and safe/easy to work on each aisle plus saves on wire cost by keeping the 208v runs needing really thick wires that run only the length of the aisles. Also since the miners are now directly fed from across the phases the is no need for a Neutral wire for either the 480v side nor the wye 208v side (but ground does connect to the center of the wye).One trick to do is set the taps on the 480/208V transformers to produce higher voltage. Usually you can set up to around 215-220v and that give a little extra margin to work with when the line dips.\n",

The templates (and included scripts) leverage the mining pool's JSON feeds to generate reasonably pretty graphs for the health of your account, worker (miner) performance and overall pool performance (if the pool supports this). With Cacti's PIA and the THold plugin you could take this further and define alert thresholds to notify you of a change if anything falls out of tolerance.Unlike some of the pool monitoring services out there, this is entirely free. However, if you feel so inclined, donations are much appreciated and help encourage the development of additional features and support for more pools.

      "It's my understanding that 400% is the maximum increase.And as for how long it would take to go back down - it wouldn't, unless people stopped mining. If difficulty and hashing power were in balance then the difficulty wouldn't change. And if the next jump in difficulty were 400% then that would suggest that there was even more extra hashing power in the network (because the chances that the amount of hashing power in the network warranted exactly the maximum increase in difficulty is pretty small).EDIT: current estimate of next difficulty is 771795, \"only\" a 36% increase\n",

      "It's due to the way the estimate is calculated.The script basically looks at the number of blocks found in the last x hours (24? 12? don't know), and assumes they all had a difficulty of the *CURRENT* difficulty, although the current difficulty is now ~30% higher than yesterday. So the script \"thinks\" those blocks from yesterday were just as difficult to find as today. Of course, they were actually easier to find, so the script overestimates the current network hashrate. Because it thinks the hashrate is higher, it will also estimate a much higher difficulty.\n",

      "That's around 3x reduction in the power. Well, 60,000 BTU/h seems reasonable power to cool down the entire system I was thinking how about you place another blue fan at the entrance. Obviously it will get much noisy as it could but can push air constantly as compared to the conventional fan that has been installed at the entrance. Going further if you are anyways trying to experiment various methods of cooling then how about doing this:1. Install a blue fan with 60,000 BTU output. 2. You will need to build a skeleton frame which will cover the entire back of blue fan. 3. Look for the HoneyComb Pads OR also called as Winter Mattress in some regions. a.

      "If you ever look to expand try to find an \"ancient\" 5970. At $500 it is the best value for mining. At $400 (sometimes you can find it on \"sale\") it blows away any other card. There are a lot of used ones on ebay but some go for >$400+. If you are patient and low bid you can eventually snag on for $300 to $330. I know some people are afraid of ebay but ebay w/ paypal has 30 day buyer protection. If the card has been damaged or is defective mining is going to expose it and a lot faster than 30 days.My rigs are now nothing but 3x5970s ea (moving from a hodgepodge or 5870s, 6950s, 6970s, 6990s). Hopefully when the 7xxx cards come out those gamers who hung on to the 5970s through the 6xxx series will dump them on ebay. Maybe we can even see <$300 5970s prices.

      "It could be if you have to pay for electricity, which I dont (up to a limit). My only concern is MH/Euro, and 5850s and 5870s are tough to beat. Even if you include electricity cost, the difference with a 5970 would be minor if you dont max out your rigs (ie, 3 or 4 cards per system). 5970s I imagine would shine with energy efficiency if you can plug 3 or possibly 4 of them in a single rig, but they are also easily 50-100% more expensive per MH in purchase.

They offered me a $200 discount, so the price rise would ONLY be $1,550 a unit, instead of $1750 a unit (over 15%). The BTC I sent them 6 weeks ago which would have covered (3) of the S19J Pros is now insufficient to cover their new higher price, even though that same BTC is now worth $38,400 - more than enough to cover (3) at their current price.Bottom line: Don't trust them on delivery times, if you trust them at all.

      "You need to pretty much ignore all the figures for hashing except the Avg one. With kanos update it is infact more accurate, hence why you see fluctuations in the hashrate. The pool side evens out over time and will never read exactly what you've got. If you want a decent comparison between the two versions make a note of the Hardware Error percentage on the standard version and kanos version. There's no point having more speed of the errors are higher\n",

The AX1200i PSUs do have an \"issue\" because they have Over Current Protection... so they actually don't work with the Neptune without using 2-to-1 PCIe Y-connectors. Choice of PSU is up <rest of post truncated>\n",

      "2 Different things going on.1) Pointing your miners to Nicehash (or mining rig rentals or a few other places) although they charge a large fee, NH does have profitability spikes when someone comes out with the next big alt coin and people want to mine it and they don't have miners so they rent. Also, NH and others support a bunch of different algorithms. So if you have some SHA256 miners and some Scrypt miners and some old ETH miners and so on you just point them at NiceHash and you are not dealing with a bunch of different pools.1a) Renting form nice hash. Kind of like playing the lottery. If you are pointing to a solo pool or PPNLS pool you *might* get lucky and come out ahead. Or you may loose. That is your risk.2) Places like Binance.

      "Also with BraiinsOS you can force different speeds and voltages that might resurrect them again. And sometimes its just the silly sensors that are bust.

Direct voltage and speed control is better than \"minus 1, or minus 2 th\", where its probably changing both without giving you enough control.

      "No, you can't find any because 2019 firmware just release this year. The reason why I recommend the latest version because the 2019 firmware added multi-option menu in miners configuration where you can set the miner to other option or low power mode. Where you can choose to increase hashrate or to run the miner at a lower frequency and lower voltage.There are sometimes hashboard works in low frequency and lower voltage so if he had this firmware he can choose what frequency and working voltage works in his two hashboard and you have nothing to lose if you try.I'm honestly don't recommend newbies to downgrade their miners to lower version which is open port and ssh enabled because there are chances that they can be hacked or become infected with mining virus.

      "Specially considering you don't need to flash it into the controller's nand, just boot it from the sd card by moving a jumper. Don't like it? Take out the card and move the jumper back. Nothing happened.As for resurrecting chips there are two things you can do:Lower speeds (in mhz), or increase voltage. Lowering the speed is safer, you should only try messing with voltages under 9v, else lower those mhz.\n",

The kernel log gives the error \"fan lost!\" a bunch, then the failure light comes on, on the miner. Now the confusion comes from the fact that both fans are spinning quickly. The one it isn't reading is the back fan, but confirmed it is working. Is there a way to get the miner to keep hashing even if it isn't reading the fan?

      "I've had so many fan failures I ran out of spares and found a temporary solution until the new ones arrived. It only seems to be the Sj brand that loses the speed sensor after about 6 months although the fan is working fine. I've also started having YaLn (Yate Loon) fans fail and completely stop. Near the faulty fan cut the yellow wire and bare the end that goes to the plug. Then slightly bare the yellow wire (using a lighter flame to soften the plastic) on the working fan. Twist the broken fan wire around the working fan wire and cover with tape. This will make the controller show both fans at the same rpm. I think the reason the Sj fans are failing is because the tiny magnetic speed sensor stops working. Ultraflow fans seem really good but it's hard to find a low cost supply.\n",

      "It really only matters how quickly the pool node can send and receive from the other top 6 pool nodes. If they could connect directly to each other, then you only need 5 (you + the other top 6) to minimize invalid blocks. If you can't manually force persistent connections to the top mining pools (which you probably can't), then you want many more connections so that you maximize the chances that you accidentally are connected to a node that is \"close\" to the other pools. In an effort to increase your odds of being close or directly connected to a pool node, you could possibly patch bitcoind to prefer nodes \"near\" the IP address space of where you suspect pool nodes probably are.But I suspect if you have too many connections, I'd imagine the cost of communicating with hundreds or thousands <rest of post truncated>\n",

      "I'm guessing you don't know how to do math.There are about 325000 confirmed transactions a day so you want enough hash rate for more then 3 full days of blocks.There are 90 days in 3 months so to do what you want would need over 3% of the global mining hashrate. The current hashrate is well over 325. EH/sOn average there are 144 blocks per day. The average fee is about BTC0.2 per block so 144*3*.2 = 86.4BTC So unless you have a few million USD to throw around it's never going to happen.-Dave\n",

      "AFAIK, the highest number of unconfirmed transactions at one point is about 200k - 300k, if hypothetically it was possible to initiate a million at the same time it would definitely cause a panic.But you have to get nodes to validate those transactions first and include them, such an influx would likely cause most nodes to not push hose spam transactions into their mempool and it never gets out.At a ferrate of 0 sats/byte, your transactions would never be confirmed.\n",

      "That isn't true. Moving pools when one gets unlucky is very smart. I started at deepbit until it stopped making me as much as I should be making. Jumped over to bitcoins.lc and made WAY more than I should be making for several weeks. Then it started to get really unlucky. Jumped to MtRed for 2 weeks making way more than bitcoins.lc would have made (i monitored it daily). Dumped MtRed a few days ago and went back to deepbit and so far have outperformed MtRed everyday since the move. Sticking with a single pool is a good way to lower your efficiency.
