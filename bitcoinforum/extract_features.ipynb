      "Mobo would be the least of your worries. You may need to get GPU drivers. The drivers with Ubuntu are generally open-source stand-ins, with minimal functionality and most likely no bitcoin mining. You'll need to use the additional drivers feature of software center(a standalone tool on older Ubuntu versions) to install nvidia-common or fglrx for nVidia and ATI, respectively. Don't forget drivers for any ASICs or FPGAs.Heat can also be an issue. Ubuntu has spotty fan control, so watch your temps and be ready to reconfigure BIOS to force fans to high if anything goes wrong. Most of the time fans should be fine, or may be forced to full power--noisier but safe, though overheating from moribund fans that are being requested to run at low speeds by the OS is not unheard of.\n",

So for like mining you should be using 160A per phase, if you have all your miners only on one phase of your house try wiring your circuits for 240v to balance the load. Or manually move some of your miners to the other leg so one side of your circuit is not maxed.I am currently upgrading from 200A to 400A and their installing new poles, transformers, meters, etc etc.\n",

      "Okay, was definitely a logical step to have the same product offerings as everyone else. I'll just have to wait for the 11** for something entirely different. It's hard to get excited about LPM when if you need it the pricing isn't something you can overcome. You have to give up a lot of hashrate for most machines running it. I would still like to see Canaan bring out a first to market product efficiency wise. The reliability has always been great, but with how fast things seem to move they just outlive their profitability. I missed out on grabbing the 1041 as it launched shortly after I had upgraded everything, but we'll see how things go in the next 6 months.\n",

      "Depends on what Lpm does.If you drop from 56th to 29th like the whatminers m21s the low speed is a wait til next year optionIf you drop from 37th to 31th like the Avalon a1041 with decent power per th savings it is a viable option at about 8 to 11 cent power.I would sit and calculate the math but I am on the iPad not the pc.There is a price per kwatt that the a1041 is just as good on low speed as top speed.There is not one on the whatsminer m21s.If someone wants to play with numbers to show the right price per kwatt.

      "Yeah it did hold on nicely, mine was still pulling a small profit when I donated it. It really came down the commands that helped dial in it's efficiency. The fact that everything came to a grinding halt last year helped a lot of gear extend their lifespan. You are right about there being a point where the earnings equal out (10.7 cents). This becomes a whole other ballgame though if you aren't selling instantly as you mine, kind of the same as when people mine at a loss. Then there's the point that I wouldn't recommend people buy new gear to mine near 10 cents, tough spot to ever see an ROI. I think you meant low on the second set of numbers.

      "Multi option makes more sense than fixed frequencies. The chips themselves are not the same, and precisely because the manufacturer started mixing them to reduce loses from low yield chips they introduced the \"auto\" (tuning) firmware.You can easily have one single chip unable to go past 650MHz holding all the others down. In reality, it tends to be more than one...Fixed frequency is useful for the opposite, to use low fixed frequencies when you are repairing a hashboard, which is why you can disable the autotuner in Braiins OS+.\n",

      "Does anyone know what the current turnaround times are for warranty repairs from Bitmain?I have an S19 with one dead hashboard. It is definitely the hashboard that is faulty. Bitmain will not accept the hashboard alone, I have to send the whole unit (frustrating).The miner is still in warranty, but with mining payouts so high at the moment, I have to make a decision is it better to just carry on mining with 2 hashboards or send back for repair (and lose earnings while the unit is away). Plus it costs around $500 to send it due to high value and insurance.\n",

      "### Reply 1:\n",
      "Maybe use Myrig or Zeusbtc for the one hash board repair?It's crazy but I guess that a paid repair for one hash board can be cheaper than sending the whole miner for Bitmain's own warranty repair, because of the down time.\n",

      "When does the warranty expire on this unit? it would be a risky move to send a milking cow like that to Bitmain when mining is this profitable, it will take them forever to send it back, also someone here mentioned that refused to send him back the miner for some reasons and offered coupons instead, oh, they also told him they have a ready client who is willing to buy the coupons and they could \"arrange\" the sale.I'd just mine with the 2 boards, without a single doubt.\n",

      "I seem to hear mixed opinions on this. From a personal perspective, my one experience of warranty returns with Bitmain was excellent. I bought a new S17+, which failed after a few hours of use. I returned to an address in the Netherlands (as advised by Bitmain) and literally the next day they shipped out a brand new miner from China. I had a replacement the same week I shipped the faulty unit (which I consider to be excellent service). The above was of course a DOA which is different to a normal warranty issue. As for how much is outstanding, currently 88 days.\n",

IDS systems are your friend, but you'll need more than that.You should also keep a whitelist around for when you're really getting hosed.

      "If you have corresponding bitcoin and aux chain blocks you can prove they are connected. All you'd need to do is wait for a pool to find a bitcoin block then see if an alt chain had one about the same time. Do a bit of cryptoacrobatics and you've got yr proof.The way it could be hidden is if when you win a block on high diff chain don't submit the work to lower diff chain. You lose the alt chain's block but then there's no link. Just keep all the alt chain blocks that solve for the alt chain but not the main chain.\n",

You can most easily test it by switching to a different pool, or by monitoring the GPU temperature and clocks. Basically, when the GPU overheats, it clocks down. On the other hand, mining on a machine with some swap memory (paging file) could cause the same effect due to leaks - on my miners it just gets the system to kill the leaking worker, with no leak related slowdown - but that's because my miners have very little RAM, and no swap memory.\n",

      "I did a ckdb update earlier (50 minutes ago)During that there is a short time frame when the web gets no stats while ckdb reloads.(Edit: looks like that wasn't the reason by your message timestamp)Mining and validation works fine - the pool itself doesn't stop or get affected by it other than not allowing new users who aren't currently mining to connect for about 5 seconds.As per design, this allows ckdb and the web to be changed/updated with no effect at all on the users mining.ckpool itself also uses an advanced restart option where the miners simply see a reconnect to the pool and no down time if ckpool is restarted with a new version.Edit2: I'll look into it - seems it might be php not always being happy talking to the linux socket (on rare occasions getting an unhandled error)Of cours<rest of post truncated>\n",

      "It is a problem with the parts used, the DC/DC is not very energy efficient, particularly when overclocked.Good DC/DC components get 90% efficiency, these dont.Also, at 5.3GH/chip they run at 1w/GH at the wall.However, that would only give 85GH/ board.It is not a problem with the chip, but of implementation. Every chip will get terrible power efficiency when overclocked.\n",

      "The DC-DC PSU part can give or add some 10 percent .The rest is the chip So you are not exactly right Show me real world numbers of Avalon 3 implementation at the same clock rates with better power efficiency than 15 percent.I agree that using ready DC DC solution for 40-50 USD will improve the power consumption a little bit but then pricing of the miner will go up and this is pointless, as far the chip pricing is too high for what it is at the current market.So at the end Avalon 3 chip is not going to have sales as it was with Avalon 2 gen chip.It came out too late, then Avalon freeze the sales for 1 month (similar story to Gen1 mess) and now it is almost obsolete.As usualy Avlalon chips are power hungry at high clock.The only way would be to under clock the chip if it has a good pricing.<rest of post truncated>\n",

      "Hi guys, so since I've been steadily upgrading miners. I obviously want to protect my investment. So in everyones5 experience which company makes the most steady and reliable PSU for mining? I don't have the 220V circuit needed to power some of the better PSU's, so I'm kind of limited to PSU'S that can run on a standard outlet. I have several miners that have a single 1000 watt psu, to my big scrypt miner which requires 2x 1300 watt PSU's. I would like to have 2x 1500 watts on that machine but I'm not sure it's possible because of the power problem I mentioned. Sorry if this turns into a Ford VS. Chevy type of questions. All I care about is a company that has solid psu's that will run hard. Thanks! Posted From bitcointalk.org Android App\n",

      "They're fantastic when they work. I might have been unlucky and received a bad batch. They were all Rev 02f, might be good to note. The only thing I don't like is they suffer from a vdroop of about 0.2-0.25v under load. They're factory set to 12.29v which gives a voltage very close to 12v under load, and can be adjusted up to 12.4-12.6v before vdroop depending on the unit. They can be used in load sharing mode with up to 8 units, so you have a lot of flexibility. I've migrated my farm to using all PFE1100 plat PSUs or these 1200w plat PSUs. Only exception is my 162 chip S7s, they're on DPS2000 to get the highest voltage into them as possible to OC them as much as possible. (12.7-12.9v from my best DPS2000s)\n",

I'd suggest posting a screenshot of the monitoring page if you could do so.

If I open the asic admin panel directly - everything's ok. The pool doesn't show any gaps. So there is trouble with hiveOS on this exact asic and I don't know what might be the trouble.

What I think is if you don't have a remaining balance on HiveOS to pay monthly their pricing for ASIC is around $2/mo per ASICminer so they might be stealing a few hash rates as a monthly payment.

Furthermore, there is no VAT in the US, unlike most of the rest of the world--this saves you 15%-25% right off the top. Nowhere else will you find the sweet spot with low electric rates and no VAT. Rents on facilities are reasonable in Eastern Washington on top of this.

If anyone's got an \"in\" with Molex or FCI I wouldn't mind a bit of assistance tracking down both parts and information.This board is designed to mate with a Dell Z750P power supply from a PowerEdge 2950; said supplies can be found fairly readily on eBay in various conditions for as low as $12. They are rated to provide 62A at 12V at 90% efficiency. This interface board provides- Screw terminals for +12V and GND so you only hook up what cables you need.- Additional output capacitance for voltage ripple and burst current buffering- Manual fan speed control (the stock full speed is quite loud)- Auto-powerup which can be triggered by an external signal<rest of post truncated>\n",

      "Glad to see I'm not the only one doing this.For the molex crimp pins, I used mouser 538-39-00-0038-CT, I used 538-39-01-2060 for the 6 pin connectors but they have one square plug that didn't match my video cards but worked with the cube. The big issue is making all the connections, it's too time consuming to do by hand and the edge connector I used was $6 plus $0.27 per pin. Overall it's worth it for my own use because I already had the tools but the labor and liability keeps me from selling any.\n",

The controller cannot run miners on different pools at the same time.Technically, yes you *can* download and compile Canaans software to run on a PC BUT it is a royal PITA to do so. Far far easier to use Canaan's pre-built software loaded onto a Raspi 3B (not B+ which does not work).\n",

First of all your SP10 won't come trashed and it will be plug and hash! Until today nobody complained that the miner didn't hash out of the box. Also the SP10 is more robust and it doesn't feel like something might break or fall down any moment. It doesn't have overheat problems since it has thermal sensors that can invoke chips shutdown separately. I saw S2s with corrupt images right on their first days, haven't seen one yet in an SP10.Also choosing SP10 will also bring you a Customer Support that is by far much better.

      "All the new generation miners such as T17,T17e,T17+ and S17,S17+,S17pro require a stable voltage between 200v and 240v, anything below or above will burn the PSU or cause a partial damage to it. You did mention this There is a good chance that you have burned 2 fans on the PSU, if you have another miner try to replace the two fans that don't spin and see if the miner will power on, if it does not - your PSU is dead.also there could be some protection-mode in the PSU, if you don't feed it with 200v-240v it won't turn on,and thus the miner won't power on, so make sure you measure the voltage.If non of the above works, then you will have to buy APW9+_14.5V-21V from Bitmian for 134$ + shipping.\n",

Go down to 10nm, things are a bit more pricey but still basically use very similar litho tech that 16nm use.Fact: For (mainland) Chinese-owned Foundries 12-10nm is as low as they go because they cannot buy the needed EUV litho equipment & photo resists much less produce it themselves.5nm is a whole different animal that requires using EUV lithography. EUV litho gear is extraordinarily expensive and certainly not widespread -- you can literally count on 1 hand the number of Foundries using it. Chips using that node are high-value and high demand.

      "Few questions1) If you have a set price, why do I need to email you for a quote? 2) Why don't you list your bitcoin address?3) Do you do escrow?4) What is this? You don't intend to reinvest, just hold for the long haul? How does that affect this sale?5) Do you have a senior member that can vouch for your trustworthiness?\n",

      "Great questions!1) You're right, we don't need to do quotes - people can do their own math based on how many units they want.2) I intended to generate new addresses for each transaction to keep track of everything, but I can see how sharing a single address would help others see activity. I'll update the primary post with that in a moment.3) I've never used escrow before and would prefer to keep transactions simple. I would be willing to try it if requested by a buyer on a small quantity (to get used to how it works).4) Ha, I find it strange too, but I advertise discounts in btc on eBay and often have buyers ask if I intend to keep or sell the btc. I figured it was worth mentioning that I don't just sell it for USD.5) I don't. Would sending a sample to a senior member help? Who would you s<rest of post truncated>\n",

      "You don't buy these for financial ROI, people. Anybody thinking they would ROI must be thinking of selling them on, themselves.But as StickMiners go, the NF6 is looking to be pretty sweet - and the price point set in this group buy is pretty good, too. At $114.73/single 11Ghash/s unit, that's about $10.43/Ghash. That makes it cheaper than the AntMiner U1 at $11.22/Ghash and only mildly more expensive than the AntMiner U2; and you'd need 5-6 of those to get the same hash rate. The NF6 makes a nice tidy package for anybody wanting to mine for fun, play with the electronics, etc.If you want ROI, you really need to be looking at the big machines, along with the upfront investment as well as power, housing and cooling needs, etc.\n",

      "Honestly, right now even the big machines are looking like they'll be a big gamble. People are hip to the game; new stuff is used in datacenters to mine, not sold off, and little guys like me have no real way to get in without a contract with a direct connection to a chip manufacturer. I'm planning out a big solar array that may make it profitable to mine, but even with free electricity a lot of the new stuff coming out won't make back their initial cost before their mining profits approach 0.\n",
