      "With the current price of bitcoin there isn't going to be ANY miner that will show a good ROI prediction ~ you're probably better off just buying bitcoin. A few hundred dollars higher and it's a different ball game. It's not the first time the mining forecast was all doom and gloom, but somehow most of the miners have managed to stay in the game. Last time around it was the move from ~$100 average price up to ~1000 that saved the day for miners; how it will play out from here is anyones guess. I can tell you that even 10% sustained growth at this point without an increase in BTC/USD rate will be toxic for most miners.There can be some interesting tax advantages to mining at a small loss, particularly if you have other gains to offset.

With fewer plug differences so that's why you find the Kill-a-watt style devices so readily available. What I did to allow for growth and density, was go with 30 amp 240V circuits to a PDU then to my miners. If you want to spend a lot of extra coin you can buy some pretty fancy PDU's but they're not necessary. That's very similar to what my first couple miners ran off, so there's nothing wrong with the circuit as is, for most miners.

The formula could be tweaked to achieve less than 2% inflation. Which even in an infinite time frame would be OK.Bitcoin at it's inception had a 100% inflation ratio!

Yes, there could be a scenario where Bitcoin will not have enough continuous transactions to provide the overwhelming profit miners saw in the beginning. I'm not sure overwhelming profit is necessary to keep some people mining. Businesses, for example, that are making their living selling unique products for Bitcoin or are otherwise tied to Bitcoin may choose to mine for free or at a loss. Bitcoin is divisible enough for everyone in the world to use it. There are 2.1 quadrillion units in Bitcoin. While that's not an infinite supply it should be enough to spread around 7 billion people.

Anyone with orders for purely the BTC ROI potential should then at that point all refund and buy BTC direct as this will net them more BTC instantly with no electricity cost than they expect to earn hashing on the machine.As an example I have an order in for $7k for a KNC Jupiter. I paid ~60BTC and estimate that I will mine 150BTC over it's lifetime (pure example figures for illustration).

Also, people getting refunds and buying BTC could stop the slump and make the price increase again, just like the current downtrend is probably partially caused by ASIC sales, where BTC is converted into fiat, which the companies need to build the units.I would probably do it if price approached $30 and manufacturers would grant the refund.

Higher difficulty would lower the lifetime ROI and thereby allow a lower delta to still make the refund profitable.I wouldn't be surprised at all if higher difficulty and longer assumed lead times with BFL products are causing refunds for this exact reason. The one thing they do have going for them is that many of their orders were made when BTC was < $20. For these people they will take a BTC loss by refunding unless the price continues to drop to extreme lows.

Here's a hint: it's not going to hash anywhere near that speed. Your average core i7 is going to be measured only in MH/s.

When you're pool finds a block of 50 coins you'd get a percentage of what you put in, which in this case is 1/50th and you'd get 1 of the coins.You'll see a huge variance of pools and none of them are really better. Deepbit is at 2200 GH/sec right now, so if you were mining for them with your 1 GH/sec, you'd get 1/2200th of a coin or .02 coins every time the pool found a block, but with 2200 GH/sec, deepbit is going to find blocks a lot more often than smaller pools.So in the end, it works out pretty much evenly no matter what pool you pick.

If you are mining Bitcoins you will find that the Bitmain S9 likes to be around the 20-25 degrees range. If you have a couple hundred of them that means it is pumping out 1.1M of BTU/hr. What are you doing to eliminate the heat and keep everything running nice and cool? Most of the large mining outfits seem to use a forced intake/exhaust system to eliminate on A/C overhead costs and to run a leaner mine. Which may be good for the pocket but not necessarily for the gear itself. - Recirculated air from A/C unit?- Forced intake with filters/exhaust?- Evaporation condensed coolers? - Geothermal?- Other?Please share.

I have been able to achieve this for over a year including the summer months by using industrial barrel fans as intake and exhaust air movers to help get the hot air out and ambient temp air in. Gigawatt up in Washinton State does something similar with their POD design. No air conditioning, just moving massive amounts of air. Plus, most mining equipment isn't made to last 4 years reliably, even if it does, it most likely wont be profitable to run 4 years. There are also no hard drives which is one of the reasons traditional data centers focus on cooling so much.\n",

This is why 240v is better than 120v...Note that China uses 230v, so, they might get away over there with a (fake thick) cable that would melt using 120v...

      "Yes, it's the close enough formula that most everyone uses. I'm certainly guilty of using the easy-mode version .WBF1, I try not to express mining chances in lottery terms (although I certainly have in the past). With a lottery, you have a very specific set of numbers in play, which define a closed system that allows you to provide accurate chances at a jackpot win. For example, to guarantee a jackpot win in the powerball, you'd have to purchase 175,223,510 tickets. To guarantee that you just win *something* you need purchase only 35 tickets.You can't make that same analysis with BTC. Yes, you expect that if you produce 49,692,386,354 shares you will solve a block. However, that's not guaranteed.

      "I guess if I had to compare it to a lottery, I would state that it's like going to the store and continuously buying quick pick tickets, and you could determine whether or not that ticket was a winner immediately. Even if you bought out the number of tickets to guarantee a jackpot win, you wouldn't necessarily have one simply because the quick pick might give you the same set of losing numbers multiple times and never give you the winning combination. Or, you could get lucky and the first ticket you bought won you the jackpot.\n",

My opinion is that staking energy (PoW) is fundamental to bringing value to the currency.

The protocol is simply just the formatting of data and how it is transmitted. What people actually care about are the consensus rules, and those are what define what is valid and not.

There are some competitive altcoins out there, but Bitcoin still holds the highest market cap.I highly doubt that they would continue to use SHA256d since the existing hardware can be bad during the beginning of that coin. Current ASIC hardware can mine a coin in its early days and push the difficulty incredibly high. That can immediately kill a coin if no one can mine on it. Also, that would lead to one of the potential flaws, mining centralization. SHA256d is easy to put into an ASIC so it becomes much more expensive to run mining rigs.

And I would agree that anything coming directly from the open source community would probably attempt to retain and emphasize any aspects of a protocol that would lead to more decentralization and keep mining accessible to the vast majority of the public. The scenario I am envisioning is more along the lines of central banks and technology leaders with established credibility trying to offer a more main stream block chain / protocol.

      "it really depends on the miner and the market condition, sometimes paying even 5%/10% of your profit MAY still benefits you. for example the D3 by bitmain has a terrible firmware , therefore usually a custom firmware was needed , and the known custom firmware by then had less than 2% fees which was very reasonable and overall profit increased even after paying the fees. however in most cases the stock firmware does just fine, also one thing that many people seem to be missing is that when dev fees are stated at say 10% , it does not mean miner will mine for 2.4 hrs straight for the dev pool and then you get the all of the remaining 21.6 hrs to your pool, it doesn't work this way simply because1- The dev fees are time-based, they start the count from the time the miner switches to their poo<rest of post truncated>\n",

      "So I'd like to gauge interest in doing a group buy for Bicknellski's K1 Nano. Here's the order page:<link> the bitcointalk thread:<link> on the order page that if 50 or more are ordered, the price is $65. If we can get 50 Nanos ordered, I'd buy 2 myself, and would ask for 2 as part of organizing the group buy. At $65 per, the total order would be $3250. Divided by 48 would be $67.71. Shipping would be by USPS First class (unless otherwise requested)Shipping would be 83.61 from Bicknellski to me with a handling fee of $4.95; so that would bring the total to $69.55 each before escrow and shipping to you. (which is better than ASICMiner block erupter).Willing to do escrow with John K if he's willing, and would price his fee into the purchase price.To re-iterate; I'm just looking for interest.<rest of post truncated>\n",

The relatively low exhaust temps that we see coming out of ASICS, has restricted the use of this energy to space heating, drying type of uses.

      "I picked up a 5970 today and after dropping it into a rig it runs great! Except for the fact that the second GPU runs about +23C hotter than number one.Running BAMT, 820/300, getting 379M/hash from both GPUs. GPU 1 is running at 77.5C and GPU 2 is at 101.5CObviously I didn't leave it running at those temps The card is clean and the fan is running properly, even if I run it up to 90% the temps are reported as very high. I'm thinking maybe they did a bad job applying the thermal compound on the second GPU? Are there any major tricks to removing and re-applying the heatsink compound? I have both generic \"white paste' and silver based CPU paste to use, which would be better in this application?Anyone ever had a bad thermal sensor on a GPU?

      "I had the exact same thing happen the first time I replaced the padding/paste on one of my cards. I'm sure your card is fine. It can easily run that hot if the thermal paste isn't done correctly. Do you know if the thermal pads were replaced? If so, make sure they used the correct thickness, otherwise you may not have enough contact to the GPUs for effective cooling. Did you buy the card brand new or used? Who is \"they\"?For the GPUs, I'd recommend using a high quality thermal paste like AS5 (or some newer fancier one) and applying it in an X pattern. There are some other threads documenting 5970 maintenance so you may want to search for those as well.\n",

      "yeah the 2nd GPU tends to run a \"little bit\" hotter (5C to maybe 10C) but 25C+ and 100C at a decent overclock is indicating poor contact with heatsink.Don't use silver stuff. You got exposed traces. If you put too much on and short a trace well the card does make a good $400 doorstop.If all you have is white paste that is better than the risk of conductive silver. In future buy a non-conductive TIM for GPU like MX2 or IC Diamond.You need a lot less than you think. It should be a tiny layer. TIM is more conductive than air but it is about 25x less conductive than copper. Too much acts as an insulation.coretech is spot on about the thermal pads. If you replaced them with pads that are too thick you can literrally keep the copper base from contacting the GPU.As far as cleaning alcohol works f<rest of post truncated>\n",

      "That's good advice D&T . I've been used to swabbing my fans / GPU dies with alcohol lately as well and it works very well (just need to be patient for the tiny areas). @OP - that seems too hot to be just a fluke. The first GPUs heat will be blown over the second one so it's normal for it to be hotter by a bit. It also depends on how your cooling is as you need to be moving a good amount of air for those cards if in a case. If it's just the card in a case with average cooling, you may eve need to downclock the GPUs by the exhaust if you can figure out which they are. I'd guess either it's bad or as D&T said, maybe bad contact.\n",

I've been running it for a few days now and I've noticed that the readings are always just around 400 GH/s on average, which seems to be a bit too little for me. On Bitmain's website, they say it runs at 441 GH/s +-5%, which still should leave me with about 420 GH/s at the very least. I am running at a clock speed of the default 218, all chips are working according to the web interface. Temperatures never go over 37 degrees.

It had solved 60 but rejected 500 in the few seconds I had to open the interface. Let it run for another few minutes, no change. I just figured it didn't have enough power even though it should; 450 watts on the 12 volt rail and the S3 only takes 355. Oh well. I switched back the PSUs and... worse? .19 GH/s... Fantastic...

Seems like the difficulty lately has been doubling even though Bitcoin has gone down in value.I realize that the number of miners are increasing, but where is all the new hardware coming from?

      "Bitcoin difficulty is controlled solely by the hashrate of the network, not bitcoin price. The difficulty is adjusted to keep block generation at ten minutes. The only incidental connection between difficulty and bitcoin price is that if it went down enough so that running a miner for people became a losing proposition (spending more money on electricity than what is being earned) and enough people just simply turned off their miner to prevent themselves from losing money then, and only then, could the difficulty go down. There are a few things that make this highly unlikely however. 1) Lots of people are in situations where they do not pay for electricity. For these people ANY amount of bitcoin that they generate is profit (hardware money is already gone) so why would they turn them off?2<rest of post truncated>\n",

Essentially (I'm oversimplifying here) what mining pools do is they split a large amount of work with high reward (finding a block) into a smaller amount of work with a lower reward (finding a share for the pool). This reduces variance for most miners. However, your computer is so slow at mining that it will take you a relatively long time to find a single share (as many pools enforce a minimum share difficulty of ~256). Try mining at a pool with a much lower minimum share difficulty (polmine has the lowest I know of). You seem new to this, so if you have any other questions, give <rest of post truncated>\n",

      "Here's an actual question about this miner protection plan. You say \"up too 4X\" the chips for failure to ROI in 90 days How exactly do you determine how many chips they actually get? I mean, say bought one of these and I make back 89% of the purchase cost in 90 days. Would I still be able to get 4x my current hash power? What happens if someone buys a unit, then I get a unit a month later - he gets 110% ROI and I'm at 89% ROI. Would I get 4X chips and he wouldn't?Is the number of chips related too your yeild? If you only make back 25% you get 4x chips, but if you make 80% you get 1x chip?I think the MPP is a step in the right direction as far as reducing risk for people pre-ordering.

      "All the new generation miners such as T17,T17e,T17+ and S17,S17+,S17pro require a stable voltage between 200v and 240v, anything below or above will burn the PSU or cause a partial damage to it. You did mention this There is a good chance that you have burned 2 fans on the PSU, if you have another miner try to replace the two fans that don't spin and see if the miner will power on, if it does not - your PSU is dead.also there could be some protection-mode in the PSU, if you don't feed it with 200v-240v it won't turn on,and thus the miner won't power on, so make sure you measure the voltage.If non of the above works, then you will have to buy APW9+_14.5V-21V from Bitmian for 134$ + shipping.\n",

I haven't seen people writing entire books on a single (or family of) models, plus you need 100% accurate information if you are doing something like servicing or repairing the miner so in most cases, the model's user guide and technical specs manuals will be as precise as you can find.\n",

StableMiner is a program that combines CGMiner and P2Pool in a GUI interface, allowing even the most inexperienced Bitcoin miner do responsible mining. I build this software because we recently almost had two 51% attacks, using P2Pool reduces the chances of this happening. Also, this version has a slight bug on some windows computers, where it opens a new instance of the program when you hit 'start mining', so just exit out of the new instance for now, until I can get around to fixing it.

If you want to run multiple cards you will have to either replace your motherboard or get a x16 card to work in a x1 slot (using an adapter and/or modifying the hardware) and then you may also have to upgrade your power supply, so the cost goes up quite a bit.

      "Overall ATX supplies - even 'server' ones - are CRAP when it comes to powering miners. They were never designed to run 24x7 at or near full load nor in the fairly high temp areas that are around miners..Why do folks insist on spending $$$ for miners and then try to go cheap on PSU's? They are critical to how a miner performs. Browse eBay, Amazon etc and you will find many folks selling decently priced miner PSU's based on real HP and IBM server supplies along with the needed breakout boards that can each easily power a miner.\n",

      "The HP PSU's? Like all real server PSU's they are solid as a rock even when pushed over rated max. That is why the HP and IBM server PSU's are preferred by miners (with 220v). Running the HP 1200's at full 110v feed load (900w) yes the fans will go into hairdryer-mode and the supplies will get rather warm but the PSU's are made for it.The AP3++ supplies are also perfect. Main advantage with them is all the power leads are already there so is plug-n-play. I have a couple dozen of the older APW3's and zero issues with them.As a side note, you *do* know that these miners are LOUD and hot right? As in a perfect 1,400w space heater.

      "I have a related question to this thread if anyone has any ideas.Can i use two bitmain PSUs on a single antminer?I am hosting my miners in a data center and they are using 30amp 208v PDUs. Since the miners each draw about 6.5amps, i can only get 3 miners in a PDU before i exceed the 24amp (80%) limit. Rather than buying additional 24 plug circuits for every 3 miners, I thought i could use two PSUs to power a single miner and plug each into a separate PDU that is already running 3 miners. So bascially, running 3.5 miners per PDU. Not sure if anyone has tried this or if it will work. So basically, my thought would be to have 2, 30amp PDUs for every 7 miners.

So you'd need a lot of space, a vehicle to move such large equipment, and probably at least two people to move it around on the ground even!As always with eBay you can get a lot more interest if you can show it at least powers up, do you have the necessary infrastructure to power it?

      "### Original post:\n",
      "The way I understand it is that they plan on bringing 800-1000TH online in the event that their market share (of global hash rate) falls significantly. They planned to keep at least 10-20% of the network and add/remove hash rate as the total hash rate fluctuates. I can't see that they'll just bring online 1000TH and shoot straight to 90%+ of the network, as that might kill trust in Bitcoin (and thus the whole point of Asicminer's existence). If the network shoots up to 1000TH+, then I would expect them to start seriously flipping the power switches on new machines to keep up, but I doubt they'll bring online that much unless they need to.\n",

This does not mean they are doing anything wrong or should be stopped, it is just in most small miners interest not to support them. You buy a USB stick from them, you allow them to put up an equal (or greater) amount of hash power to balance out their share of the network.

      "The bounty certainly is attractive, but it can't make me find the time to do it, and I have no experience with that sort of code. Then again, I also had no experience with bitcoin mining, opencl code, overclocking, curses.... so anything's possible. My willingness to dedicate time is the hardest thing to win over right now. When I did cgminer I had a personal sabbatical with time off work and used the project as part of my need for programming expression. I have not the time now, so I'm not sure if there is much that would make me want to. Bear in mind that even 100 BTC is less than 300 bucks and think how much real contract work pays. I like taking BTC as a concept, and encouraging BTC trade through doing so, but I'm not earning any real money at these prices.\n",

      "The JSON RPC is also the reason why bitcoin, pools and even ltc have such problems dealing with what amounts to not a lot of data.LOL time is irrelevant, if I wanted to write it I'd just write it using sockets like I've written many interfaces before.For web sites it's simple to use sockets between C and PHP so I'm sure it must be simple for ANY other language.The JSON RPC is written on TOP of sockets I guess usually using CURL since having to write a full HTTP implementation is a pain beyond belief.CURL/HTTP is a way over complicated interface to use to pass simple data and nothing is gained by using it.If someone else wants to write it then I guess JSON RPC is what will be used and it will suck badly like the rest of the JSON RPC interfaces spread throughout Bitcoin.I get and see a lot o<rest of post truncated>\n",

      "Hey all,Been following and reading this board like crazy, finally decided to post. I've got a rig that's got Crossfired 6850s, running at about 196mhash/s each. Are these cards capable of pushing more out? I've been reading 250s for lower end cards, so I'm assuming more is? I'm not proficient enough with the parameters to pass into everything, so I'm not sure where to begin trying =\\Using the Slush pool currently, with current extras at -v -w 128 -f 30, using GUIMiner.Thanks!\n",

      "Overclock it a little with MSI Afterburner. Also try to see if you get better performance without crossfiring them, you might need a dummy plug if windows don't pick up the 2nd card.

As of 2022 the country Kazakhstan generated 7 million dollars from bitcoin miners; 1.5 million in the first quarter. Hence, the fee is low for miners that use renewable energy; green energy.

You can use tool such as <link> to perform such chance.As @kano said, double spend by rollback/overwrite few blocks would be noticed. In addition mempool.space have block health feature[1] which compare expected block (based on TX with highest fee rate) and actual block.

The machines arrived in September, and I ran a few of them in my house and at friends houses for a few weeks while I spent another 4.5k to rent a space for a year, 11k Canadian to set up electrical, and 2k to set up some very big fans, and another $100 a month for internet. I ran my servers for October through January with no problems, other than the vaunted Alberta low cost of power being something of a lie. (We are charged a base rate of 0.07 to 0.08c/kw, BUT with transmission fees and riders extra based on total power used, total bill comes out to approximately 0.16c/kw).In January, the \"Smart\" meter that the local power company installed started reading double.

Which of the two systems makes more sense when it comes to getting the most Bitcoin rewards?The prices of the T19 Hydro, including the Antspace, are far below those of the S19 XP with immersion cooling system. With the S19 XP could be generated by custom MinerOS/PSU significantly more Hashrate. However, this would make the S19 XP equal or even more expensive in terms of power costs. Then there is the problem with the thermal paste that is washed out with immersion cooling over time and leads to more maintenance. Furthermore, the T19 Hydro uses water for cooling, which is always available. With immersion cooling, a special liquid is needed which also leads to extra costs.\n",

Seems like if you run 8 threads worth on a T2 (there's 8 hashing units on each T2 die, from what I can read), you would hit ~31.25Mhash/sec if you hash 8k of data.Where the paper is a little unclear is if hashing 512 bits on the hardware is worthwhile, since it seems like the Sun supplied code will use the hardware if it's worth it. From section 4.2.1 in the paper, if we force the hardware to hash 512 bits, then we see that the speed of the hardware is only 1510.94kb/sec.

      "If by \"sizeable amount\" you mean \"more than zero\" nope, I have not gotten a sizeable amount of anything from anyone since the BM1384 purchase end of June.40GH would probably take more than 2A of 5V. Probably take 2.5V at that point, since the chip would be drawing 10.5W by itself plus conversion losses and controls. I'd estimate 12W into the stick at 40GH, which my base Compac design will handle.I could buy an S7 and part it out, but the chips would then cost a little over three times what I paid for my BM1384 stock. End cost for the stick would be more like $30-35 than $25 and it'd take about seven S7 to prototype and run out a full 1000-stick batch. Technically possible but probably stupid.\n",

      "It's not just the extra 500w, the number of chips on both gears are different, the chips themselves are different, and the way they attach the heatsinks on each of these models is totally different, you can only make this comparison between two S9s running at different hashrate.But to be honest with you, I think there is something wrong with your setup, I mean even the 68C on S9 seems too high for immersion cooling, maybe it's the 30c temp outside that is causing this, you are going to need a bigger radiator and a larger pump.Also, keep in mind that the T17 runs a bit hot by default, also the heatsinks are \"loosely\" attached and depending on what type of liquid you are using, the heatsinks might just come off at any second, with that in mind, 90C isn't the end of the world, your board temp<rest of post truncated>\n",

      "Hi Mike, Thanks for your valuable input.I too wasn't happy with S9 readings. I invested alot in this setup. The radiator is a 24x24\" wood stove heat exchanger that many miners use to operate two S19s (rated for 6,000W), hooked up to a 3,000 CFM ventilation fan.I installed the radiator and the fan to an A/C hole to push hot air out and keep the room cool. The pump is also a March MDX that I've got after miners have recommended it. The tank is designed for S1X/T1X models with two chambers and a flowplate.This T17 is the upgraded version (reinforced), I got it from China for $1,000.

      "Chip temperatures. I believe the board temperatures are accurate. I don't know for sure what the cause is, but I believe it has to do with the calibration of the external sense input of the TMP451 used on these boards. The external sense input is used to read the temperature of a sensor integrated into the ASIC, and needs correct calibration settings to get accurate results. The internal sensor on the TMP451 that is used to get the \"board\" temperature is calibrated at the factory so it doesn't need any additional setup by the firmware.What mikeywith mentioned is also true though. You may need different flow rates because of the different power density. A s9 running at 1400W is using only ~7.5W per chip. A T17 at 1900W is using ~21W/chip.\n",

      "### Original post:\n",
      "Hey guys,I am running a bunch of Antminers on BraiinsOS, which has an implementation of cron that allows me to periodically execute custom scripts that will start or stop the mining process depending on the current profitability (I have changing electricity prices with high volatility). So my question is: Is there a way to reproduce this behaviour using something like cron on a Whatsminer M20s?Does the Whatsminer firmware even support cron (or some other job scheduler)? Unfortunately I don't have any device to try this out myself.Any hints are appreciated!\n",
      "\n",
      "### Reply 1:\n",
      "It seems there is no cron on Whatsminer I tried to search here even on Google I can't seem to find cron for Whatsminer except for Antminer. So I guess your only option is to use a device that can automatically shut down and reboot the miner it might be a \"programmable outlet timer\" that looks like this belowBut you will need an outlet timer that can support a high amp. Since Whatsminer m20s consumption is around 3360W you will need a 4100w outlet timer or around 20 amp.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Reply 2:\n",
      "Whatsminer tool has remote control functions, one of them is (Suspend/Resume) mining, so that is somewhere to start from, also, if you don't use the latest firmware for the M20s you can still access the miner via SSH, so you can run a script to suspend and resume.If that doesn't work out, you can always use something like \"Sonoff Basic Smart Remote Control Wifi Switch\" that controls a contactor that controls the miner power input, these smart plugs come with their own applications which you can shutdown/turnon from anywhere or set a timer for them, they switch costs about 3-5$ and the contactor is probably in the $15 range, not a very expensive project if the software road turns out to be a little bumpy.\n",

      "I tried googling the same thing, that's why I asking here. Appreciate your effort! Unfortunately this solution will not fit to my requirements, as exchange electricity prices (and thus profitability) are not predictable. I could pay 3 cents / kWh today at 10am and 12 cents tomorrow at 10am. I need something that will allow me to actually run code to calculate profitability every time electricity prices change. Also, wouldn't I damage my hardware if I kept shutting it off and turning it on all the time?I'd prefer to stop the mining process, not turn off the device itself.\n",

      "Whatsminer Tool could have been a solution. Unfortunately they only support a 64Bit Windows application, but my existing miners are getting their \"should I mine or should I not mine\" information from a 32Bit raspberry pi. If nothing else works I could consider setting up an additional computer for managing Whatsminer devices (hopefully not).Furthermore I am unsure whether or not I will be able to programatically turn miners on and off using the Whatsminer tool. In the software manual (to be found at: <link> there is no deeper explanation of the included API. Using an outdated firmware may be another option.

It did not originate from BFL (see <link> for the hardware side and <link> for the firmware side), though BFL are the ones commercialising it. Like many open-source projects, work was done in our (allten and I) spare time, on a purely voluntary basis.

S19 should be the same although I haven't actually seen one yet.For a plain S17, 1 hashboard does 16 to 19 TH at around 45W/TH, so 720W to 855W per hashboard.Not likely to find any at reasonable prices though.

The heatsinks rely on high flow to keep chips cool so if your air is going around the board instead of being forced through the fins it'll overcook.You should look into braiins or vnish firmwares that allow you to adjust the voltage and frequency of the S9.

Currently, there are refund requests for 5557 chips [1]. If you exclude jkminkov's 980, there are 4577.

There are very few posts in the Mining section recently although many people around the world are interested in this kind of information.Nice photos. 500 views in 5 days without sharing to the imgur community means there is an interest.

      "That's probably accurate. The new a761 and a8 series are supposed to be rolling out in 4-6 weeks (end of January they say, but they're always late).They're a little underwhelming, honestly. Off the top of my head they're 9ish and 11t respectively. The new units from Ebit look a lot more exciting. E9++ and E10. The first one is 10nm running at 18t and I dunno about the other one. They're already available for pre-order. I'm getting mine for 32000CNY each.I've only run Canaan machines up until now, but I'm definitely ready to move up!\n",

This would directly compete with Apollo BTC in terms of price, but manage roughly 8x higher hashrate at just 3x the power cost.I do think that there's a market for sub-2kW and especially sub-1kW miners.

You can check for connection of these pins with the big ground pad to see if that is correct.- the mode_0 pin is left floating for mode0 Antminer has previously defined mode0 as mode_0 pin connected to ground.Changing the description of these pins and of the mode does not change the functionality of anything but <rest of post truncated>\n",

I'm in the US.If you're talking about a cable with 6-pin on both ends you're looking at 12 pins per cable so 12,000 pins. Unless you buy a press, if you're just using hand crimpers that'll take weeks. Before I had a pin press I could reliably expect about 500 cables in a 40-hour week if your hand didn't cramp up and fall off first. That's if you have wire already cut and stripped; this takes much longer than pinning to do by hand.\n",

You dig a lot of rocks with no diamond.The difficulty level is how rare the chance of finding a diamond is.you are digging thousands of shovels as second a GPU will do 100 million to 200 million, a $50 ASIC will do 333 million. an $1000 one will do 30 BillionA big mining pool is doing 413 Trillion all together and the find a diamond every 1.5 to 2 hrs (or 1 min or 5 hrs but luck balances out over time)So if 413 trillion takes over an hour how long will 150 thousand take?\n",

The block difficulty then goes way up, and they'd have to produce even more units (small batches = high cost per unit). All the while, they're competing with themselves to produce blocks, which soon produce half as many BTC per block.Scenario B: Suppose, on the other hand, they get thousands of pre-orders and can run a large production batch (cheaper/unit cost = more profit each).

      "The probable scenario is that the asics units will ship right into the reward halving which looks to be mid-December. That first group of 50 THash will come right as the market is trying to stabilize with the new world of 25 btc blocks, and the natural upward pressure on value that will create. Suddenly there will be a massive increase in hashing, difficulty will skyrocket, and those 50THash of first-adopters will try to dump enough coinage to make their investment back in a matter of hours.Which will collapse the market for a period, shut off most all mining except for the 50 THash, kill the market for lesser asics hardware sales to the hoi polloi (like those Jalapenos) and eventually create a stability around the new 8700 pound gorilla- the 50 THash.

      "MANY Asic usb stick buyers on ebay (I resell some sticks keep some for me) can run a small hub with 4 sticks or even a 10 port hub in a free power setup. Think dorm room. A 7 port hub link this one.<link> will run 7 asic miner sticks at under 30 watts. 1 blade needs 70 watts . It is not plug n play on bitminter's java client. A lot of ebayers use doc h's java clientSo if someone has 7 AM sticks running right now on free power. selling one of these will be an easy sale plug n play.More then 500000 AM sticks are hashing at this time worldwide. these will sell they are a natural upgrade to any AM stick owner. I do agree that .49 btc is high 7 am sticks cost .245 btc half the price. These could be lower priced if they can make a lot of them.\n",

Unfortunately, being in the right isn't everything.

It's got some good adhesive, and I don't want to break the toy just yet! It would be interesting if each board can accommodate 10 more chips. You'll note one side is fully populated with heatsinks, one is missing 10 - perhaps airflow is sufficient enough. If so, on the 3 chain ASIC setup they have, that would mean an increase from 138 total chips to 168, nearly a 22% increase.I'd imagine this would create way more strain too on the power pull. 22% on top of even the 1584 I reported puts it at around 1930 watts.

      "Mark the Stratum v2 release as a victory for the open-source bitcoin community. For a decade, it has been the software of choice for miners to interact with pools and with the bitcoin protocol per se. While still necessary, bitcoin mining pools have a centralizing effect. With Stratum v2, miners will get to construct their own blocks. And thats just one of the innovations, although the most talked-about one.<link>\n",

For the small miners, there really is no advantage to all the additional overhead that it needs.

Or is it expected that we'll have a LAN device that aggregates traffic and provides configuration interface?Upd: I see they have different connection options on their website. Is there a way to monetize this so-called \"translation proxy\" that is basically what I mentioned above? Maybe there is a commercial opportunity, but still I don't know why would anyone buy such device.. there is no real financial incentive.\n",

      "V2 has little to do with the original Stratum.A miner should do only three things : get shares from a pool/node, process the work, report results.Oh, and monitor itself & provide a GUI. Fine, that's 5 things. Period, end of story.IMHO having the low power CPU's in a miner deal with more than the absolute minimum of work is a horrible idea. Then there is the matter of changing work w/o it being obvious to the owner of the hardware. Ya know - like the security hole known as extra-nonce aka XNSUB which allows the miner to change work on-the-fly to mine other coins (DevFee hashing is 1 example) -- as well as do other things in the background if it connected to a bad-actor pool.Everything I've seen points to V2 being solely for the benefit of pool operators and not the miners themselves.\n",

      "Firstly - block constructing was called GBT. Yeah years old idea.Some pools supported GBT for a while ...No one ever actually wrote code to use the transactions supplied - GBT died.It's death was a good thing.Stratum already has the option to request the transactions, so you can verify the merkle slices, but not change the ones used.No one uses GBT or that option in stratum for a reason:What it actually leads to is 2 things:1) about 2000 times more data per works sent, and thus about 2000 times more data per day per miner.Yeah so instead of about 15MB a day per miner per pool connection, you are looking at about 30GB per day per miner per pool connection.This also means on average more than 3MB of data per work change instead of less than 1500 bytes.Networks do not transfer data instantly.<rest of post truncated>\n",

      "I'm not sure if you're implying something malicious but just in case, it is impossible to \"steal\" a portion of your hashes while mining. If you get different results in hashrate when starting cgminer yourself vs. starting cgminer using CGWatcher, it may be due to the \"gpu-threads\" default value. CGWatcher uses 2 as a default because the cgminer documentation stated the default value was 2, but in reality when you launch cgminer yourself without specifying the \"gpu-threads\" setting, it would run with 1. In the latest version of CGWatcher you can disable this so it will not use 2 as the default value if no value is set.You can go to the Tests tab and locate the Utilities section.

What's more, as bitcoins sit squarely outside the traditional banking system it's going to be difficult and costly trying to get any back through the court system. I honestly have no idea if I'll ever get my mid 2012 order shipped. At the moment I'd put the odds at 50/50 at best, with a daily decline. BFL has to be burning through large chunks of money to keep employees on site and pay the rent. Every time they ask for a PCB revision or another batch of test chips I shudder at the thought of how much all of this is costing.\n",

      "No. AFAIK the difficulty does not matter regarding the speed at which the miners mine and the power they use. The miners will mine at a set speed and simply have to do more work to find one solution. In a given amount of time, the miner will do the same amount of work, just that with different difficulties, a different number of solutions will be found.No. You will actually be paid less. Since you are doing more work and spending more time on one problem, you will be submitting less solutions (shares) than with a lower difficulty.

You need a little money easily accessible and the rest stored safely.\n",

I don't want to lose my hardware if mining is banned. Is it possible to mine anonymously using vpn or tor should such a thing happen(at least till my hardware lasts). thanks\n",

      "### Reply 1:\n",
      "Mining over tor will dramatically increase the possibility of losing a block if you ever found one.If you are mining on a pool, and don't think you will ever find a block, why would a pool want you to mine with them?There are no bitcoins created unless a block is found.Using a public VPN will also increase latency, sometimes dramatically also.You have no control on the performance of the VPN and sometimes it can be good and sometimes very bad.So, the simple answer is yes, but the relevant answer is:it's a very bad idea to use tor,and a bad idea to use a vpn unless you have full control over it and have full control over where your data is routed.However, to include comment about the word 'anonymously'No bitcoin mining is anonymous no matter what you do.\n",

      "### Reply 2:\n",
      "You can use a VPN, just get a decent router that supports VPN and use a paid VPN service, using VPN \"may\" and is likely to increase the latency of your mining operation, but if your connection to the VPN itself is good and you use a mining pool that has a server close to VPN location you connect to - the latency added will be very low and your earnings will not be affected by any considerable levels.With that being said, should your country ban BTC mining you should NOT be mining bitcoin, the government always has other means to spot your mining operations even if you hide it from your ISP.\n",

      "### Reply 5:\n",
      "VPN is the only solution for your problem as suggested above you will need to set up your router that supports VPN because there are some routers that don't support VPN setup. And the problem is the latency just like what kano pointed out but it depends on the VPN location you choose and it might be also depending on the number of the miner.So how many miners do you plan to run anonymously?\n",

      "in my opinion, i think your best bet would be to use a VPN and deal with the bs it'll bring. idk how much security it would actually add as if anyone was actually trying to find you, that's the first thing they'd look to see if you were using. perhaps look into setting one up w/ a raspberry pi:<link> idea how it would perform tho. also not sure how much you are mining but IMO if you need to preserve your privacy you should use coinjoin or whirlpool, some sort of non-custodial mixer after you receive the mining rewards. rule of thumb, never spend mixed coins with unmixed coins or you risk doxxing yourself.\n",

ASICs are fully customized, hence designing and implementing them requires more money (NRE).Originally designed in 1985 as just digital processors, FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) now include both analog and mixed signal blocks. Because FPGAs are simple to use and reasonably priced reprogrammable devices, customers choose to employ them. Moreover, they are less computationally efficient than ASIC devices and i can't figure out why.\n",

The other factor, process just means the smaller the transistor the less physical matter there is to consume power and thus give off waste heat.

      "Of course, there is a solution for you.

      "1 - just forum search \"linuxcoin\" and you will find lots of help (your have to hunt around a bit to piece it all together though).2 - no, but you need at least 2GB, and don't forget to make it persistent.3- the usb sticks might be a tip-off. Also, you must be thinking of CPU mining, and I'm not sure linuxcoin is set up for that (haven't looked into it). You are probably asking whether the mining activity would be a red flag on the network, and I'm not sure about that, but I know there are others who have mined with a bank of campus computers. But since you are thinking of running a different OS on each computer, that might be pretty obvious.\n",

I find it hard to believe that a company no one has ever heard of has somehow developed a chip that beats the leading manufacturer in the Bitcoin space, not by a little, but literally blowing their machines out of the water.Contact the guy on Craigslist and ask to see the miner and see them in action. I would not buy a thing unless he can verify in person that it indeed gets 20TH/s while using 2100 watts of power.

Of course, this doesn't take into account that you could run a KnC miner for 1-2 months to recover most or all of your investment, and then resell it at a premium (hopefully) to lock in additional future ROI much earlier than 1 year, when all of these pre-order devices will be just about useless if TBG is any indicator.

The chips are pretty bad at thermal runaway which means 100-125MHz is a practical top-end for passive cooling, though with moderate airflow they'll run 200MHz (45GH) at under 5W on stock voltage.I have seen these sticks pushed to 90GH, which makes them roughly hashrate-equivalent to my Terminus R808 pod miner but <rest of post truncated>\n",

      "I. IntroductionThis guide is intended for anyone interested in heating their home with the waste heat from a Bitcoin miner. In the meantime, used ASIC miners have dropped in price so much that they have become attractive as a replacement for electric heaters. The advantage of a Bitcoin miner compared to an electric heater is obvious: Not only does it generate almost the same amount of heat as a heater, but it also allows Bitcoin mining. A well-suited Bitcoin miner for such an undertaking is the Antminer S9, which has become increasingly affordable in recent times and is now available for under 200 USD. (Even under 50 USD if you buy in large quantities)II. Necessary changes1) Brains OS+By default, the Antminer S9 outputs 13 TH's and requires 1300 watts of power to do so (= approx. 1300 watt<rest of post truncated>\n",

Do you think there is a benefit with just on fan or could this be also be done with two fans? Two fans will have the benefit of a fail save in case you loose one fan. It may be paranoid, but I have seen to many pictures of burned down S9s That is a very good addition, since indeed the power supply will be the noisiest part of the system if the fan is not modified.

      "FYI I just got one today, after 20 minutes it gets to 2.06 Gh/s with clock=x0981, and it runs great with zero errors and zero rejects.When I overclock to 0A18, which on the U1 is 2.2 Gh/s, after running for 20 minutes it only gets up to 2.12 Gh/s with 0 rejects and 5.41% error rate.So, it seems like 2.0 Gh/s is the max you can expect with low error rate. I haven't been able to find a user manual on the U2 yet however, and the clock parameters for overclocking may be totally different than what was used for the U1.I have emailed Antmain about this but have not heard back yet.Edited to add:After 2 hours it's hashing at 2.063 Gh/s, with zero rejects and zero H/W errors.Also, FYI my USB power is not an issue. I am getting my +5V from the molex connector of an ATX PSU at 32Amps.\n",

      "if you had a u-1 and a u-2 to compare you could see if it has the same resistor controlling the voltage allowed to the chip.Based on you tests so far I think it is the same. which makes the older sticks better in one way the will fit on a tighter hub. the newer sticks may not need fans.So if you have a choice of sticks some may prefer the new for the silence offered. Some may prefer the old for the smaller size.\n",

It'll cost me about $7/GH but since I would like a little compensation I'm selling it at only $10-13/GH.Do you guys think that's a good deal? I mean, I try to be fair, and it's a much better deal than the other options I've seen. I run the machine and promise repairs like Fan fixes, and Power Supply running out.

      "So I have a few mining rigs and was thinking about ways to make them cheaper. I thought about using a generator or possibly a series of batteries with an alternator hooked up to something like a workout bike. I'm not sure how difficult these would be to achieve but I know the workout bike would most likely require a lot of exercise (probably more than 1 person could do). Maybe if you owned a gym? Or thousands of hamsters on their wheels. But for the gas generator, has anyone tried this or know if it would be cheaper to pay for gas to keep it running?There's also a way of using wood gas to run the generator I think but that might take some time to \"refill\" or loss of power etc.Basically I'm asking which method would seem more reasonable to power miners?\n",

      "The generator wouldn't work? Why?And yes I know it would require more then 1 person to build up the energy needed to charge the batteries. But I know you can charge batteries with exercise. Just depends on how much is needed.You could have 12 batteries hooked up to your miners on one end and an alternator on the other end. Then the alternator converts the energy from let's say 20 stationary bikes to stored energy in the batteries. So the bikes don't power the miners directly, but are used to store energy in the batteries. Then you just advertise \"free gym\" haha\n",

      "Well, if you want to run a couple stick miners that would be fine. Look at the chart, a healthy human can provide 0.2HP (~150W) for a little less than three hours. If you wanted to something like a single Antminer S5 (~600W), you would need five people (~750W pedal power to get 600W electrical power) working together in three hour shifts to the point of exhaustion. That'd be 8 shifts a day, or 40 people if they can do the 3 hour shift every day.At $300 and current difficulty, all that would produce $3.68 per day.The gas generator would only work if you have free gas. I would guess even with free gas you might be underwater just with genset maintenance and repair if you're using a small ~1000-3000W model.\n",

Not many generators are fit for constant running, so a typical cheap stuff won't cut it you'll need an industrial or military grade gear. What is more a small generator with low wattage will be much less efficient than a big one, so buying it for a small mining farm is a waste of cash.There are special kits that allow you to use propane as fuel.

I don't think the price of electricity is cheap enough. I think you would need to move to another place with a decent amount cheaper electricity if you truly want to be a commercial datacenter. Other problem is 200 shops. Your talking you need 200 of everything, this scale is not really reasonable. I mean 200 security systems, cooling systems, networking equipment, etc etc. And employees going in between them would be a waste of time and money.

Cooling would be centralized, with a extraction system tailor made to remove heat of 36 KW of bitcoin mining equipment, not wimpy systems made for meatbags . Networking equipment would be a cost each \"resident\" would need to cover from their assigned ethernet endpoint, i would just provide building backbone, again, tailor made for the specific needs of a bitcoin mine.Each employee here is just $20 a month Really cheap labor.Places with cheaper electricity i have enough now, i'm develop<rest of post truncated>\n",

All failed inside the 12 month warranty period (around 9 - 10 months in), however Bitmain refused to take back only the faulty hashboards, so with shipping costs (for sending the whole miners) and downtime I figured I'm better off to just leave the miners running on 2 hashboards.

      "The plot thickens... to somewhere between treacle & caramel.You can actually rent Amazon images cheaper than the \"On Demand\" rate. How much cheaper? Well, for the GPU instance, about a third of the price. How so? Well, you can either rent the server a year or three at a time (that's $5630/year for the GPU instance, yielding ~13.40 blocks - 670 BTC. How's the ol' cognitive biases going?) - OR - you can bid for instances. This is called \"spot\" instancing. Think of it as the Mt Gox of instance rental. They even have pretty graphs of the history of bids.So, spot pricing... well, the GPU instance goes for about $0.76 per instance hour. That's a good 1/3 of the usual price. So lets shoot back to my original post and push these numbers around...$0.76 hour-1 x 8 instances = $145.92 day-1 1.64 Ghs-<rest of post truncated>\n",

Right now, new from Bitmain it's $360 (1.434BTC at their current conversion rate). Let's just pretend there are no other costs at all (you already have a PSU and no shipping costs). At the current $250 per BTC, even with only a 2% overall increase in the network hash rate per adjustment you will not ever make ROI with $0.10 per kWh power.

As we all know, the higher the difficulty, the longer it takes to mine Bitcoins (or parts of it).One of the solutions for this potential issue has been investing massively in hardware. On the Bitcointalk forums, you can find pictures of peoples mining rigs consisting of anywhere from a few, up to 50+ graphics cards, all hashing away.

It would be nice if those were included as well. Some, like me, bought early with the few coins we had available. Didn't complain when the price came down and bought a few more only to see it drop again. It would be nice to see the reward go first towards the early 1.99 BTC purchasers and go down from there.Canary, if you can please pass along this sentiment and suggestion along if possible it would be appreciated.Thanks.\n",

The reason we aren't going down alternative routes is that VC companies aren't too keen on financing asic mining project for the public to make money from them - they want to keep them in house to mine themselves, and that's not our ethos. The amount of money we need to even get to chip prototypes is simply way more than all our combined resources and then some, so this seems like a logic route.We will never comment on how other companies conducted their business. None of us were BFL customers so have no knowledge of the quality of their service or products, but there is no argument that their products did (eventually) make a lot of people an awful lot of money.

They pay in other hidden, indirect ways, but as long they're not getting a bill for the kilowatt hours used per month they believe it's free. Miners living with parents, or taking power from work are two examples. They will continue to mine long after mining is unprofitable either due to a lack of interest in bitcoin or a more efficient technology being adopted (FPGAs, ASICs, etc).

By the time I ship them everyone looses money (except FedEx Ground)However, I can put in fans that are quiet and use them as small heaters in the warehouse over the winter. It is never going to get above 40F in there so I can run them with lower speed / lower noise fans and the miners are probably never going to care.If they do go get to hot they shutdown. If they loop between being too hot and then 40F and this causes the hash boards to finally fail, no big loss the beagleboard is probably the only thing that is worth money.Sad that it has come to this, but it is what it is. -Dave\n",

One thing that I have never seen being discussed is using solar panels without batteries, and mining only during sunlight, and not grid tied. Ideally, everything would work great when there is full sunlight and the solar panels are producing electricity at full capacity.The part that I don't know is what might happen in the morning or evening when the sun is low in the sky and the solar panels are only generating a fraction of its capacity. Just for argument's sake, let's say the mining rig is an Antminer S1 drawing 300-watts of power at 12VDC and two 12V 300-watt solar panels providing 600-watts of power during peak sunlight.My question is, what will happen in the morning and evening when the solar panels are o<rest of post truncated>\n",

      "There is no such device. Solar powered equipment uses a battery to buffer the supply and load. To get optimal power out of the panels you will need a charge controller between the panels and the battery. A charge controller alters the apparent voltage of the load to match the optimal voltage of the panel (which will vary depending on current conditions). Slapping a panel to a fixed 12V load is going to kill 30%+ of your output. As for what happens if you supply a device designed to use 25 Amps less than 25 Amps? Well it depends on what undercurrent protection the device has. If it is none then it is very likely you could damage it.

      "I agree , but I would like to comment that a simple charge controller does not do anything than cutting the voltage exceeding the battery's characteristics. A simple charge controller cuts the voltage when exceeds the 13.8V (for silicone types ) and 14.2V (for Pb types).There is nothing else it can do. It makes nothing more than what a solar panel could do directly connected to the battery (except from protecting it from overvoltage).There is also the case of an MPPT charge controller that , as you said, can offer an additional 30% approximate gain compared to the previous case.But such a controller would cost more than twice than what an S1 does.Lastly, using an S1 with current lower than what needs, would create huge HW errors.

      "I will defer to HagssFIN since is a lot more knowledgeable and experienced then me.One thing that I have read is the consumer grade PSU like this are no designed to run at full wattage on the 12V rail. Usually they are less efficient and the 12V rail is only designed to take provide 60-70% of the power. That supply would not be able to power an S9 by itself.I think your best bet is to get 220V installed. If 110V is absolutely the only option, then an APW5 may be about the best viable option - it will stably supply 1600W at 110V (or 2600W at 220V). FWIW the APW5 is also very quiet - I use three of them to supply all my miners.\n",

      "Try to replace the PSU fans, if that does not fix it, then well, you got a dead PSU.Check with @gracezhou1993 on telegram, she usually has them in stock, however, the price will likely be in the 200-300$ range which is of course more expensive than buying directly from Bitmain, also as of this week, Chinese vendors started to charge 5% on all crypto payments, the prices they list is usually in USD (bank transfer, WU, and whatnot).\n",

      "Your question is a little difficult to understand, but I'll take a stand at one part of it.As far as I know, you can't. The Bitcoin client won't connect to a pool to get work, it will only process its own work. Also, the Bitcoin client won't use your GPU, only CPU.If you want to use your GPU, or mine against a pool, you need one of the standalone mining programs like GUI Miner.That question is a bit vague. Do you mean, you only want to mine while playing EverQuest 2? Or mine only when not playing EverQuest 2? For the latter, I believe there are mining programs and/or scripts that will only activate when your machine is idle, thus allowing you to play video games without having your computer slowed down.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Reply 3:\n",
      "If you want to mine on your GPU at the same time as playing games or doing other things, simply use m0mchil's poclbm miner (you can download GUIMiner, which includes poclbm) and add \"-f 120\" to the command line.The -f switch tells the miner that you want it to back off so that you can maintain a certain frame rate in other programs, like Everquest 2, while it mines with your video card.For the CPU miner, just lower the priority of the process using task manager, and it'll only use \"spare\" CPU resources.\n",

      "Really depends on what you're doing. If your solo mining, it can be a long time. Figure out how much your total hashrate is and pop it into this calculator.<link> let's say you are currently mining with 500 MH/sec across all your miners, you're looking at making on average 1.16 BTC a day, but if you're solo mining you can only find a full block of 50 so you have to extrapolate that out as to when you can expect to find one. So, 50 / 1.16 = 43.1 Days, on _average_ until you find a block of 50. That's assuming the difficulty level doesn't go up, which it's about to tomorrow and likely will every 2 weeks.Of course, you could get lucky and find a block in your first hour of mining or you could mine for 12 months and not find a thing.

I want to encourage users that have purchased Avalon units secondhand to come forward and provide information about their units. You are eligible for the reward and you are not obligated to return the ASIC to me. This sentiment conflicts with the offering of a mining percentage to donators if the Avalon is retrieved. The way I see it, the criminal will be outed by a buyer or a friend turning over information for the bounty. If it's a friend, there's a much higher chance of retrieving the Avalon.

Can I mine anything at all with this machine, and in that case, what mining software do you recommend? I tried GPUminer but I was only able to mine with one of the cards - don't know why. I also tried Bitminter's client. It mined a bit faster than GPU miner, but the cards got a bit hot. Had to take out a PCI card that obstructed the airflow.

      "What is your proposed cooling arrangement, that's one hell of a density. The specifications suggest those PDUs downrate to 24A for 24/7 usage, so keep that in mind. It makes them an awkward size as you'll only get 1.5 SP35s per PDU. I am unsure if there is an alternative though, hopefully someone will be along shortly to help.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Reply 2:\n",
      "You'll never get to 20 density in a single rack with normal \"off the shelf\" power parts, and most likely also not achieve cooling for it. You're talking 140kw in a single rack, most US data centers top out at being able to handle 20-30kw per rack for cooling. That being said, if you have enough cooling you could possibly make 16 per rack using something like an APC 9750 PDU. The PDU you showed will be able to handle 2 SP-35's per. But since it's a zero-u PDU you can only put 2 per rack thus only 4 total SP-35's. You'll need to go with the horizontal ones to fit more. In this configuration you would have 2 units per 1 PDU so 16 Sp-35 and 8 PDUs would give you 40u used with 5u available.\n",

      "### Reply 3:\n",
      "Those PDU's won't work as your trying to put 73KW in one rack.You will need a PDU with a IEC309 connector, those are good for 60A of 3PH and the PDU's can usually handle a little over 17KW. You can get the extended rack enclosures that allow 2 of these per side so you would get 4 PDUs and 240A of rated power in the rack thats about as close as you will get, but if you stick to code you can only use 80% of the rated power 24/7.Since you didn't ask for cooling advice I will just give you a side note. Most Datacenters can not handle this amount of heat from one rack, you will be a glowing red violation when they do their thermal imaging check.\n",

      "We have 27 right now. We can add up to 32. More if we move the switches off the top shelf. If we get a wider shelving unit, we can probably get up to 50. We may run some S2s, but even at $2000 they are overpriced. Hum, thats not a bad idea about the solid piece of wood to block hot air from coming down. The middle rack is by far the hottest rack. I wonder if doing that will restrict airflow too much? We also are going to put covers over half the miners to see if that improves cooling by trapping the pulled in air fully down a tunnel.\n",

      "Just tell them it's magic internet money and it comes from pixie dust and unicorns.In all seriousness, I've had success explaining it in terms of accounting and ledger processing. People seem to understand, at least in general, how credit cards work. In terms of storage and usage of the money, the concept of safety deposit boxes, account passbooks and wallets works well, too. I've also been successful in just explaining it as a foreign currency. If you go to Japan, you convert USD into JPY. BTC is just another currency into which you can convert your dollars. Finally, talk to them about investment vehicles, and stocks.If you can relate BTC to things they know and understand already, they'll get it.\n",

      "The purpose of mining is to process transactions. Since there is no centralized authority with control over the ledger (i.e. the Blockchain), there needs to be a way for transactions to be processed in a decentralized way. Miners take upon this responsibility by using their hardware to process transactions, but of course, this comes with a cost (i.e. time + cost of hardware + electrical costs). Accordingly, there needs to be an incentive for people to do this, and that's why miners are compensated with the block subsidy (currently at 25 BTC every ~10 minutes on average).When the block subsidy runs out, there still needs to be an incentive for miners to keep processing transactions. This is where transaction fees come into play. Assuming BTC still exists when the block subsidy approaches ze<rest of post truncated>\n",

Even with credit cards, they don't really know the ins and outs, is just some place to store dollars or euro, it still works within the known (that is fiat). The hard concept to grasp for them is the fact there isn't fiat involved, so they see it as something non serious. Also Bitcoin isn't backed up by armies, fiat is. Most don't believe something that isn't backed up by guns and instituntions will work I've gotten a lot of people into bitcoin and this forum tho, and I have a mate that did a presentation about Bitcoin and lots of them seem interested, but that was easy since it's mostly math and physicists, the hard task is talking about this to the average joe.\n",

      "That's a bit different than your original query, which was how to explain mining. As I originally stated, and then the joint detailed, mining is nothing more than processing transactions in the ledger (the blockchain). Expanding the credit card analogy, you can state that credit card transactions are \"mined\" as well, just that the mining process is wholly owned and controlled by the credit card provider (Visa, MC, etc). You have to trust that provider to accurately and truthfully manage everything for you. Want to make a purchase? You have to trust that the company will properly authorize and settle that transaction. Since nobody owns Bitcoin, there is no centralized entity you have to trust.\n",

      "I ran p_shep's cgminer on a e3000 without any hashing hardware connected and it errors out. So, AFAICT, mining on the broadcom 480MHz processor isn't possible at the moment. It's certainly an interesting idea, if a dedicated router could SHA-256 hash quickly. I think it's negligible though because unless there's onboard dedicated hardware for SHA512 hashes (AFAIK, no routers have this -- and if they did the mining community would have found and bought them), it will be CPU mining with a 480MHz processor which just isn't that fast (esp. without difficult assembly optimizations).\n",

It should be something like \"/dev/ttyUSBx\" with \"x\" being a number like 0 or 1 etc. Then launch cgminer with the --scan-serial option like this : ./cgminer --scan-serial /dev/ttyUSB1 in case your device uses 1 etc. Make sure to compile cgminer with the BFL support because it comes disabled by default ( or if you are using the binaries the same applies and you need to compile manually with BFL support on ). <link> how to compile.

I thought the shipping is excluded anyway? If its the auction that would become a problem because of to many bids then maybe some website script could be used to automate this. A min of 300 means probably a couple thousand units to be sold.

      "Hi good days, I have a few question about the S7 miner hope to get some help & guidance. 1. Does the S7 miner need break/rest time.? If run it for 24/7 how long can we keep on going like that.?2. Does the APW3-12 bitmain power supply good enough or need to get different one.?3. Anyone know the lifespan of S7 miner if run 24/7.? 4. Is there any other crypto currency that can S7 miner be used for.?Those are some of the questions I can think of for now ...Thanks for your advice & replies\n",

      "Hello,1. No it does not need rest time, as long as your ambient temperatures are good enough for it to not overheat, maybe you will need to shut it down once in a month or so to remove dust it has sucked into itself... That depends mostly of how dusty the room it is running is. It can run like that for years, for sure longer that it will be profitable to run it.2. It is good enough3. No one can tell you for sure, but I am sure it will run for years, again the lower the temperatures the less stress it is for the unit.4. It can be used for some other SHA 256 crypto, is it more profitable than BTC? I don't think so...Hope this helps.\n",

      "A good example of how long miner's can go is the S3 and S3+. If treated well they keep on hashing, those with \"free electricity\" have done very well with them in many cases as they keep working. Yes you have to clean and use decent PSU's. But they can have a very longspan. I mean going back to stuff that no longer makes sense to mine with like asicminer blades, and usb sticks a lot of them still work longer then mining makes sense.On PSU the APW3 will work fine with S7 and S9. I have used it without any issues in my mining area. I sold my S7's as it no longer made sense to mine for me. And I kept my APW3's they work great with S9 which is great as I have already paid for them long ago.\n",

If you treat the miner good cleaning, proper power, etc. I still think S7/S9 will have a long life as a lot of S7's already have been hashing quite a while. S5 not a bad miner, and S5+ i loved as a miner it was honestly a great miner I was sad when I sold it due to my electricity cost.But look at number of S7's out there still running there are a lot. So there are a few bad stories... but small number compared to total sold I would guess. Only one I ever had trouble with was a C1... and they were kinda a different best.

      "<truncated> that this is from my testing on an engineering sample and there's bound to be minor differences between units. There's two lines there, one for USB 2.0 at 500mA, and one for USB 3.0 at 900mA. The Gh/s (effective) associated with Iusb under those lines are roughly what you should be able to get from those ports as long as they behave. Note that you could combine multiple ports (same as you may have done in the past with an external CD/DVD drive or 2.5\" HDD, using a little splitter cable), but you would have to be certain that the ports have individual power regulation and the bus is rated for the additional draw, which is not necessarily always the case. Thus for higher hash rates, external power (via a powered USB hub that doesn't put any current draw cut-offs on the ports) is <rest of post truncated>\n",

      "Hi!1) 150MH/s isn't ridiculously low, there are likely to be plenty of people around who throw less than that at it and are quite happy doing so.2) No, you probably can't handle those cards with that power supply. Probably 850W+, but the brand quality is also very important. Read reviews.3) If fortunate, you can get around 500MH/s with 2 5830's: <link> if you aren't afraid of overclocking. They're also about half the price of 5850's ($230 vs $110, from a glance on NewEgg; I'm not from the US - your prices seem high). But with a decent enough powersupply and fortunate chips, you could get ~700MH/s if you did spring for 5850's.4) From what I understand, crossfire doesn't matter for mining - and is better without.Really, it comes down to how much money you are willing to throw at this, given <rest of post truncated>\n",

Whereas if you can improve your mining hash by at least 20 then thats a notable difference.The best things are to overclock your gpu and underclock ur mem. Use msi afterburner, amd clock tool to do this. remember to keep below 90c, I usually aim at 79-80c.\n",

However, for those who are interested to generate passive income through mining Bitcoin, it may be a viable option only if certain conditions are met such as living in a region with low electricity costs or having a personal solar system to power the mining setup.

I could sell a shitload of sticks at a low price . making 20 to 30 bucks on 3 sticks works for me since I have no workload vs making 57 bucks and doing all the work.Downside is I piss off a lot of other sellers with lowball prices.

      "Honestly, if Canary wants to sell on eBay he should sell on eBay and undercut the other resellers there like he does here (pure capitalism). The margins are slim enough on eBay and Amazon now for anyone selling and hoping to recoup profit before the next BE price drop. As-is, it seems like most folks on there about start selling their inventory when the next price drop rolls around, so it is only a matter of suckers buying them at the rate they are buying them before more sellers pop up with lower prices. Plus this muddies things - what if there needs to be a return, what if a unit is DOA, etc.? That's a lot of shipping around to involve a third party in one of those transactions, mailing fees alone for such an error would likely eat up profits for people buying at current prices.\n",

      "Generally speaking when a miner is issued work by a pool, that work is based on the pool sending the work to a specific user. It's like there are 25 contracts out there and the pool sends out 25 contracts, and 1 user can do all 25 and return that work. The work issued to a miner can only be submitted by the miner to count for a solving block. You can't take it somewhere else and submit it (many people have thought of this idea and thought they were brilliant).So if you are solo mining you would be working on a different project so to speak. You can read all the technical stuff if you search the forums or read the white paper.Basically you can't turn in somebody else's homework. If you solo mine it would have been a different set of work and you probably would not have solved it.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Reply 1:\n",
      "Ok Solo mining is the process of mining alone. When you connect to a pool, what technically happens is that all miners are connected to the same bitcoin-client in order to confirm transactions. This increases the probability of \"finding\" a block, but in turn the block reward is shared among all miners.When you solo mine you connect your miner to your own local bitcoin client and try to \"find\" a block on your own. The probability of that is a lot lower but in turn you do not share the block reward.Given how the bitcoin network works however. In the long run (that means if you mine either way VERE VERY LONG) solo mining and pooled mining will get you exactly the same amount.In realistic timeframes though pooled mining definetly is the better way if your hardware has only small hashrate.

I am just mining with 2 Antminer U2s for educational purposes and already switched to the solo ine lottery since having them run 24/7 isn't worth it.

      "### Reply 5:\n",
      "Well since most altcoins basically are more or less copies of the official bitcoin client with some changes to how block detection works the config also is more or less the same. The generally similar things are:You need the official wallet/client of the coin to setup solo mining.You set that wallet into server mode (the server=1 line), which basically tells it to accept outside connections.You set a password and username to allow connection only if those are given. Most clients do not enter server mode and give a warning/error message if those are not specified.You set a range/list of IPs that are allowed to connect. Some clients will allow any IP to connect that uses the correct password/username if the router forwards connections. This makes this an optional setting.You set a port to li<rest of post truncated>\n",

      "As I explained for Muhammad, if you setup the coin client to run as server and accept outside connection you simply point your mining software to the client instead of a mining pool.That means, if your hardware is connected to the same PC on which the client runs you simply use <link> (change the 8332 accordingly if you set another port) as the address of the server in the mining software.If your hardware is connected to a different PC or has a network device and mining software of it's own (the bigger ASIC machines tend to have this, although you could still simply connect them to a PC using USB afaik) you need to use the local network address of the PC that runs the client as the serveraddress in the mining software.That should be it.It really is fairly simple.\n",

You could also then use the BTC Core wallet if you chose to do so. That is what I do.If I am incorrect that running a full node would help the network, someone please set me straight. Mine on!!\n",

      "I will add a few more points.To start off, you can simply just buy any number of Wasps and Hives that you can afford and they will be delivered to you if you wish.But let's say that you can't afford to buy a whole Wasp right away. Well, then you can buy as many GH/s as you can afford, just to start out with. Once you own a full Wasp's worth (or many Wasp's worth) of GH/s, just as CEX offers, you can request to have the physical miningware delivered to you at any time you desire.And there are plenty of individuals that want to invest in Bitcoin mining, but do not want to hassle with or do not have the expertise to the maintain the mining gear. Having SWMC host the miningware is a good solution for them. Additionally, SWMC will be using industrial strength cooling like oil cooling and other <rest of post truncated>\n",

IF the price targets end up at the lower end of the range, IF the boards can be fabricated relatively soon, IF you can get the data center up and running before difficulty kills any chance of profit. Love the idea, it could really be killer if enough people sign on. Could really push chip prices down, and commoditize a lot of the industry which is great for miners. Cool.Questions:1) What is a hive? How does that relate to a wasp? A wasp is a single fully populated board, correct? Is a hive a collective of wasps under a single controller? Is there a more robust definition than that?2) If a wasp board is populated with something like the A1, and then next year the A2 comes out at 20nm and 4x the power (I am making this up, not a real example!<rest of post truncated>\n",

I really like the idea behind Namecoin (distributed DNS) but it never really took off. As far as the other alt coins go, I think they are mostly worthless as they have no advantage over Bitcoin. This is my opinion of course, and you guys are welcome to mine any alternate SHA256 currency that you like. Some have even generated more profit by switching between alternate currencies as they become more valuable than Bitcoin for short periods of time.

Same applies to USB cables.

So I know the compensation is under 14 coins. I also know it is more then 5 coins since we average less then 75% power. if we average 50% 14 / .5 = 28 we are owed 14 coins. if we averaged 75% 14 / .75 = 18.67 we are owed 4.67 coins.So we are owed less then 14 coins and more then 4.67 coins.

Except we actually were mining at 390 million difficulty for the first few days so it should have been closer to 33. I don't think BTC guild has been yielding that badly so we must have been under 50% hash rate on average. From what I can tell the compensation would bring us up from approximately 50% to about two thirds of calculated returns. But there's no way all the equipment could have been up instantly on Nov 1 so if you drop the first day the numbers look better.I ran the calculations another way and basically we lost about a day and a half vs mining full force from nov 1 with the compensation so I think it's nice and fair since the original promise was that it'd <rest of post truncated>\n",

In many cases, you only need to re-solder them to solve the problem. If it still doesn't work, you may need to replace the chip.

      "Power is the main thing with a mine. Try to get a spot with the right power coming in already would be my advice. If the space is too large then sublet some of the space. If you have a location that is perfect (right size, right price, good location, has security) then compromise on the power coming in. Getting up and running quickly and staying running will be paramount to ensuring profit, even with a non-ideal electrical service. Here is a possible strategy: With industrial spaces you can sometimes get multiple electrical services brought in. Start with the existing 208V 3 phase and add on or build out the larger system in parallel.

      "Every share has the potential to be a block, if the difficulty of that share is higher than the network difficulty. When Bitcoin was first starting off, every share that had a difficulty of 1 or more was a valid block. Then 2. Then 500. Then 100,000. Then 3 Million. Now it's 149 Million. You get the idea. It's going up, which makes it more and more difficult to find blocks.These block solvers are shares that were not only just above the network difficulty of the time, but also astronomically higher. Right now, a share with a difficulty of 151 Million and 151 Billion would both be block solvers, and both earn you the same amount of BTC, but the second one is 1,000 times harder to do.For me, it's just a cool little fact to see how high luck has been pushed.

      "No. Each hash attempt is independent of all others, so each hash attempt has the same probability of solving a block as all others.When you have more powerful hardware, you are simply making more calculations within a set time frame. When hashing rates increase, there is a greater probability that larger hash sums will be discovered within that set time frame.So, no, it didn't take \"1000 times longer to find.\" But, on average, you would solve 1,000 blocks at the lower difficulty in the time it would take you to solve 1 block at the greater difficulty.

      "I have cgminer set to start in a bash script which calls the program \"screen\" to do so. This works great except the very useful stats printout cgminer gives when exiting is lost since that instance of \"screen\" terminates. I'm sure there's a trivial way to either log this output when cgminer exits, or a command that can be sent to screen to have that \"screen\" instance remain displayed on the terminal when exiting cgminer? I'm still fairly green with linux and my searches and reading the man page have come up empty thus far.\n",

      "Thanks for the info. I did attempt to redirect output of cgminer to a log file, but that did not work (it just logged the first xhost message and nothing after that). I would also just want it to log the exit stats anyway, not everything, as I am trying to minimize IO as much as possible since this is a USB stick (I already changed the disk scheduler method and mounted tmp to use RAM). I will try it again and see if it works, however. The default scrollback buffer size of 100 lines should be more than enough for cgminer's exit stats, I would think. Basically, everything above the current terminal screen (which is only 24 lines high) is cut off. I will change the buffer size but I suspect it isn't going to fix this particular problem.\n",

You are effectively either skimming 200gh/s for yourself as stated(& 22BTC), for free! Or taking a cut of 1BTC per 50gh/s sold(40BTC). As in your 2TH costs 14k but you are collecting 180BTC.If I was to correlate this with current prices (BTC/USD) you are trimming off 70BTC for this unit.Would you consider dropping the BTC price, in line with the reduction of the unit Prices?

      "I feel ya but it's not his fault, all supply and demand. If the Antminer wasn't out, and ASICminer didn't produce so many cubes, then the price would be higher or less soft. He's just the seller, and a great one at that, but to remain competitive he needs to price at the market. Holding out for a price drop doesn't make sense because the units cover less ground now than they did a week ago. The thing to be frustrated with is that something 2 months old is seen as \"obsolete\". I'm tempted to buy 2 more at this price, but at this point I'm just gonna let what I own run for a while.

      "We're potentially at a turning point right now in the market as BTC has been moving sideways, regulators have been quiet, and cost of inputs has been increasing. All this points to a breakout (IMO), I don't have a crystal ball but increasing inputs alone should result in miners holding and a shortage with buyers bidding up BTC. At the .75 cost it might take a while to mine back if paid with BTC, but I have a feeling the cube will prove profitable if you translate all costs into dollars. Of course all of this depends on BTC breaking out to a new high, and I don't claim to make good predictions but it can't go sideways much longer with all this hardware action happening...\n",

      "50 donations * 2 btc each = 100 btc. That's about US$12,500 at the moment, for 150 boards. US$12k isn't really that much to raise on your own. Heck, many people could fund it with cash advances on their credit cards if you can't get a bank loan. Those boards together constitute a minimum 1 to 2% of the total hashing capability of the entire bitcoin network. 3,600 bitcoins are being generated ever day. If you grab just 1% of that it's $4,500 per day. In 3 days you have the loan paid off.I'm curious as to why you need investors in your boards, and don't just keep the lucrative money making machines for yourself.EDIT: Just read that the 2 btc is an initial donation, and that the donators will be obliged to pay the balance to receive the boards.

While miners connected to the Raspberry Pi will have a high power consumption, this one would be best for coin staking which takes very minimal power usage.\n",

      "Black glue does work well for sticking heat sinks to chips and requires refrigeration. But this thermoset adhesive is usually used for S9 and L3+, black glue is usually not used for Antminer 17 series hash board. The heat sink of 17 series is usually soldered on the tin plating on the surface of the chip, so long-term high temperature can easily cause oxidation and the heat sink will fall off. This is the most common failure of the 17 series. At present, if there are too many falling heat sinks, the best way to solve this problem is to refit upgrade heat sink.\n",

Clean with a mild acid such as DEoxit Gold for good adhesion. If you wanna go further there are heat sink epoxies I cannot speak to with experience.

Of course this can be serviced by an electrical and the amperage increased though addition of new panels and the gauge of copper running from the street to the house. 150 amps at 120 volts will get you 18,000 watts. Most circuit breakers are 15 amps. To be safe each circuit breaker should support 1,800 watts at 15amps. You can buy higher amperage circuit breakers.

      "First, I call shenanigans, because no one would be foolish enough to invest 30,000 in bitcoin mining without trying it out on a small scale first. Second, asking if the price is going to go up is pointless. If anyone knew the answer with certainty they would buy up all the bitcoins they could right now so they could sell them if/when the price went back up. Third, you paid way too much per Ghash/sec if you really spent 30 thousand! You might have to start considering whether or not you should start selling the hardware. Your chance to make a profit in this still exists if you got the video cards at a decent price. There are tons of people who will pay inflated prices for them right now.\n",

      "Well keep mining for the moment because with over 22.5 Ghash/s you should be generating $560 / day worth of Bitcoins based on current difficulty and exchange rate.

      "Buying a used miner isn't a good idea if both parties don't fully trust one another, a video proof means nothing as far as i am concerned, you could have gotten a broken miner from the get-go, of course, things could go wrong with shipping and handling and whatnot, or the buyer could be dishonest, so the seller can't just refund everyone who claims they received a dead miner.Maybe it's for the best, I only heard negative stuff about this model from various sources, the PSU has a very high failure rate, and hash boards are poorly built, overall a bad gear from what I heard so far, which is probably why it sells a lot cheaper than its rivals Whatsminer and Bitmain.\n",

When I try to run the miner a new CMD window flashes on my screen too rapidly to read anything, or even see if it says anything. I don't get any errors in the CMD window I'm using to launch the miner but I really don't feel like it's working. I'm also not sure how I'm able to tell if it is working.Any assistance would be appreciated.Thanks.\n",

I ended up going with the Sanyo fan with higher RPM on it as replacement.... but really was kinda moot.My mining area uses lot's of CFM's to cool it from fan's and a nice exhaust.

These units have been set to the defaults, I almost never force manual fan speeds (learned my lesson on the A6's). I figured out the issue with my replacement fans. I had to swap the tach and the control wires in the 4 pin fan plug and leave the control wire disconnected to get them running. I now have the S7 running on aftermarket delta fans albeit with no ability to control the rpm anymore. With the weather warming up here the fans are running at max pretty much all the time so losing the ability to control fan speed is a non issue at this point. Thanks to everyone who replied!\n",

Maybe you should check the voltage of the power supply that you used with the Antminer that 'blew up', it could be outside the specified range. It is possible that what caused your problem is external to the Antminer, such as the PSU. Do you use any UPS/Surge protection on the AC inputs to your power supplies? Do you have issues with unstable mains voltage or lightning?Cheers\n",

And FPGA's seem to always come after ASIC's, so that'd make sense. You have to design the ASIC before it's an ASIC, right? Anyway... It would seem that there are people with FPGA's mining X11.

FPGA stands for \"Field Programmable Gate Array.\" An FPGA is a hardware chip in which the hardware gates can be connected and configured in different ways, to produce a different result. This still requires a hardware design, so you can't just go out, plug one in, and write a little script and get going. It's still a pretty in depth, low level design, requiring someone knowledgeable in digital design.I am not an FPGA expert, although I am generally fairly familiar with electronics. Can you mine any algorithm with an FPGA? That's a very difficult question. Certainly, there are some things, which can be implemented well in ASICs which are not nearly as efficient in FPGAs.

      "Hello, I'm located in Missouri and I'm in the process of upgrading my bitcoin mine to get about 300 kilowatt of power. Need some help with figuring out what's the best option for me. My cooperative power company give me two three phase transformer options. Option 1. 277/480V 4 wire wyeOption 2. 240/480V 4 wire DeltaOption 1 will require a second dry type transformer to go from 277/480V to 240/415V Wye so will be a bit expensive. Option 2 will not need a second transformer, since I can get 240volts from between line and neutral. This option seems too good to be true. Is there a catch here? Am i missing something ? This is a high leg delta system and I wonder if there are some inherent downsides to it, since most miners seems to prefer wye systems.\n",

      "That Wikipedia link explains it all.The 'problem' comes when the 120V single-phase portions are used for lighting and other 120v things- you need to make sure that every 3rd opening in the breaker panel is NOT used as it is the high-leg and will be around 134v vs 120v when referenced to the neutral. Beyond that the addition of 120v loads unbalances the 3-phase loads because the wild leg only supplies the 3rd phase.Considering you will be mainly running 240v loads using 2-pole breakers everything automatically balances out. Just make sure you never plug a 1-pole breaker into the wild leg slots as it will not be 120v.\n",

      "This should be in the mining support board instead.Short answer: NOLong answer: This is probably a glitch in btcTool, the multi-option firmware has an option to underclock the miner by 3 terahash but a maximum of 2 terahash for the overclock, you should NOT attempt a firmware upgrade, the latest version has no tuning options and you probably can't revert to the 2019 firmware which has the drop-down options for tuning, I also believe +2th is already good enough to sustain your miners anyway, don't push them hard.\n",

      "Well the ASIC only has advantage if it's doing the specific task it was designed to do. It has an advantage over a GPU or CPU as long as the coin is SHA-256. Other coins like Litecoin have their own ASICs made for their protocol (scrypt).So yes any new coins that come out that use an algorithm for which there is no ASIC (like cryptonote based coins) will have an advantage on GPU since the Bitcoin ASICs can't even attempt to mine those coins.
