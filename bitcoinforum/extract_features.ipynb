      "Hi people. I just bought some 6770 some time ago, and I've been using it for mining since about three weeks. I was using ubuntu 11.04(since I cant get everything up with debian), Catalyst 11.5 and poclbm. Ok so with stock clocks, I get 170MH/s out of pocl. Two weeks ago I overclocked the card from 800 to 850, it was producing about 182MH/sec. Yesterday, since it was all running stable, I pushed the card to the max clock, that aticonfig supports. Everything runs finde, Hashrate is about 195MH/sec.So far, so good. I then wanted to try the phoenix miner, using the following(got it from the wiki) settings:-k phatk PLATFORM=0 DEVICE=0 VECTORS BFI_INT WORKSIZE=256 FASTLOOP=false AGGRESSION=13This gives me 165MH/sec which is even lower than the 170MH/sec the card does on poclbm without overclocki<rest of post truncated>\n",

Some altcoins like monero can be mined in cpu, whereas most altcoins will be profitable if only mined in gpu. You should take electricity charges into consideration for getting profits. If you want to avoid these and still mine, then you can join cloud mining schemes like genesis mining where you would have to pay just one time charges based on hash power you select, but maintenance charge is also calculated.

I recommend the S5 for figuring out if Mining is for you just to get the feel of things, if it turns out you like it and have access to higher voltages you will find yourself upgrading sooner rather than later.As far as a pool I used bitcoin.com pool as they had been offering 10% bonus on payouts but have since stopped.

Also order and shipping address is in the buyers name, buyer makes direct payment etc. I just made a deal with them a day before and by this time I learned a lot thats how I come up with the idea of having it for worldwide, you need to understand a starter makes some mistakes in first place then he learn and correct it.I dont know the previous 1.95BTc (GB price is 1.90BTC) is still on hold, this is the first time I am dealing with bitmain and putting a big order for myself, so if they dont ship it in time it will affect me the same way its affects you.\n",

      "About 4 months after marto74 announced his assembly service for avalon chips I've got my fully assembled bitcoin miner called HEX16A. The board is based on TechnoBit's design for 16 chip miner, ordered first week of August for 49,30 from their online shop. My first impression of the board is the massive heatsink that covers the entire backside of the board, together with the huge filter capacitors close to the chips. Those two factors and the improved power supply module helps for the great overclocking capabilities that HEX16A provides. It can easily be clocked to 500Mhz with less than 2% HW errors, that makes the board one of the best on the market. TehcnoBit provide their version of cgminer with support for the board and adjustable core frequency and voltage. Here is a chart with the pe<rest of post truncated>\n",

      "A question for the Linux specialists. When the HEX16A is started without the SUDO command, you get following errors ;Code:USB init, open device failed, err -3, you don't have privilege to access - HEX device 1:4hexminer detect (1:4) failed to initialise (incorrect device?)Is there a way to get rid of these errors by giving the necessary authorities to a folder, file, etc. ? Update: After some research on the internet i found the solution. In cgminer folder you'll find a file named <truncated> following line into file '01-cgminer.rules' and copy the updated file to <truncated> <truncated> <truncated> SUBSYSTEMS==\"usb\", ACTION==\"add\", MODE=\"0666\", <truncated> a reboot of the raspi, i was able to start cgminer without the SUDO command.\n",
