Topic: Advice -Adding additional 6 pin PCIE outputs on a PC modular Power Supply?
### Original post:
Hi AllI have a few modular/semi modular PC psu's and was thinking of using the to pwer some S9 miners with 2 cards. Most of what i have are 1000w or higher.They will be worthless selling so might be better put to use on some S9s powered with2 cards, so i would need x7 ouputs all together.I think i could use an existing hard wired PCIE (6 pin or not) to power the control board.Then on the dedicated high amp PCIE modular ouputs could i not solder on connections and 'share' the load so x2 on each output?I have only seen x8 to x2 PCIE cables so could i not just splice in and solder another?If this works i could do a few more miers in thsi set up as it would be low power and quite when set to 700/800w.Anyone done this or got an opinion on it?The PSU's will either go to waste tbh.Pics attached.<link>

### Reply 1:
@NotFuzzyWarmYes i will be running only 2 boards @ 700w or 800w.Is that why 'common rail' modular PSUs are so expensive?The only PSUs i can see that have enough outputs (X7) are the EVGA ones and they are silly money, i'm surprised that nobody has found a decent PSU and 'modded' them for more outputs tbh.....I just can't find makes that suffice apart from that brand?I think if i open it i can see rails and go from there, 3 on each for the hash boards and an existing 12v ouput for the control board.Thanks for the advice.

### Reply 2:
Looks like the +12v are seperate rails and GND/-12v shared.I will just add an extra pin to each double 8pin >x2 6pin.So i will have a set of two 8pin >x3 6 pins.Current will be approx 800/12=66.67aIs this correct?<link>

### Reply 3:
To be honest, modular plug PSU's all have 1 major problem: They are pushing the maximum current rating through the contacts and generally have only 18ga wires between the PSU and PCIe plugs.Ok, that's 2 major problems...That said, since you are talking about running at reduced power it may not be an issue, just periodically check to see how warm the PSU connectors get. Yes, I've had a few rather spectacularly fry over the years from when I used them to power s3's & s5's...Other thing to keep in mind is that particular PSU has 2 independent output rails. DO NOT connect power from the 2 different rails to 1 hash board! They will be shorted together and fight each other.

Do you have the newest drivers?

### Reply 2:
Usual instructions for when people DONT read the readme.Reconfigure xorg for all devices, start x and export the DISPLAY variable before starting cgminer.

### Reply 3:
I just find it so weird how people dont read something that specifically says ""READ ME!""

### Reply 4:
Ahh, thanks guys I actually was exporting the DISPLAY variable in my mining startup script but I'd stupidly disabled this while installing/testing the card. That seems to have solved that problem! Unfortunately this led me on to a new issue: The Xubuntu computer loses power very quickly when I start mining on the 5970 with anything above intensity 1, but it mines fine (intensity 11) when installed in a different windows machine...When the linux comp powers off, it's without warning I have to wait a little and toggle the PSU switch before turning it on again. Both PC's have adequate PSU's (760W) and the 5790 is the only card being used. So it has me puzzled. Why would mining cause the linux machine to quickly shut off? Temps on the fan never get a chance to hit 80 before the power cuts off.I will start a new thread on this if it comes to me getting completely stuck (I can try a 7870 in the linux computer and see if it has the same problem), but I hoped someone may have a good idea why this is happening? ATI drivers are 11.11Thank you very much for ideas on this one and happy hashing!

He clearly edited the post after you guys have commented, anyhow , this is the miner he is talking about I guess.<link> it does look like an Inno gear with a bit of modification, in that link they clearly saywhich means phill is right, you need at least two PSUs, each must be 1400w minimum , and according to the video, it does look like he got 2 PSUs connected, the miner's fan do spin for a while and then stop , and you saidWhich means you tried to overclock the miner, you either burned the miner or one of the PSUs, does it show on the network ?? can you access the user interface? please post more details.

Do note that the OP has not made any mention of trying to contact the distributor or manufacturer of this knock-off miner. That of course should be the very first thing the OP should have done...Nor have they posted anything else re what has been said so far.

### Reply 5:
He needs to know it's a knock-off in the first place, and honestly if the gear does 32th at 2800w as promised-- it does not matter what name they put on it, as for contacting the manufacturer, honestly this is usually the last thing I personally do simply because1-The support at these Chinese websites is terrible, had a ton of issues with my gears, most were solved by trial and error or from information I got online (mostly on this very forum) , while the manufacturer will give only give you the abc of trouble shooting only.2-In many places, the shipping cost for returning the miner back to china is unreasonable, to the extent that some people rather order new hash board/control board or a PSU than having to pay that much for shipping or wait for months to get their replacement.I think if OP provides enough information and kernel log, someone will be able to give him the solution for this problem without the need for a crystal ball.

Topic: USB Block Erupter showing up as generic USB Device instead of ""Port"", won't mine
### Original post:
I've been mining with two USB Block Erupter Sapphires without issue for at least a week now, properly cooled. Today, I've been messing around with things trying to get my Antminer U2 up and running and must've done something that now causes one of my erupters to show up under Device Manager as a usb device instead of under ""Ports"". When I try to mine with it, it just sits in standby doing nothing. However, if I plug it into my Win 7 machine it comes up normally under ""Ports"" instead of ""Universal Serial Bus Devices"" but I don't have an ethernet to that box to test if it will mine. I'm not sure what exactly is going on with this stick. Is it fried?

### Reply 1:
Maybe you installed a WinUSB driver?

### Reply 2:
Is the problem on a windows xp machine? This may be a device identifier issue. I've never seen it with 3 devices, but I suppose it is possible. There is a fix posted in these forums somewhere and if I have time to dig it up for you I will, but if you keep restarting and plugging it back in to different ports it may eventually pick up properly. Windows XP doesn't handle duplicate usb devices very well.

42W at idle? Good lawd. My x6500 FPGAs only burns up 17.2W at full load...Didn't they like...put a dummy load in place of the ASIC chips and actually test these boards or something while they were waiting on chip delivery?I guess not.

Really? If they were a scam you could expect as realistic a 'prototype test' as they could muster, and I saw nothing in that vid which proved much of anything. It amazes me to see how many people consider a vid of some numbers changing on a screen to be 'proof' of anything more than a tiny amount of scripting ability.You could also expect that they would make the 'test' look just good enough to give people hope (and thus not cancel their pre-orders) but bad enough to have a reason for another bunch of delays.The only thing which gives me some amount of hope is that they made things look worse than they really needed to.As I said for Avalon, I won't believe with a high degree of certainty that they can hash unless they can publish a set of hashes within {x} amount of time of a known dataset being globally available. And even then, not until a very credible third-party is standing over their shoulder to make sure that they don't have an Avalon hiding under the desk or something of that nature. I wouldn't trust these people at all.

Topic: can anyone explain evaporative cooling system
### Original post:
hi,so im thinking about designing a new bitcoin shed for my farm as a project.i have fell across this farm: <link> they are using a evaporative cooling system to cool there miners and i thought it was a cool idea however had some doubts. The writer describes it as ""durable paper product that looks like the wavy corrugated part on the inside of cardboard. Water is pumped to the top and flows down, and the fans blowing outwards on the other side create negative air pressure, drawing fresh air through the holes and cooling it."" however i don't understand how they do it with all the moisture coming into the farm at night and from the system itself wouldn't it damage the miners? how do the keep the moisture away from the rigs? Can explain this cooling system in more detail? Thanks,Jeppe

### Reply 1:
try this >> <link> It's pretty easy ..

### Reply 2:
But how do they keep the moisture/humidity out from damaging the equipment??

### Reply 3:
<95% humidity isn't a danger to electronics, its only when you start getting fully saturated air that it begins to deposit droplets everywhere.

### Reply 4:
hot surfaces = evaporation.cold surfaces = condensationminers and heatsinks are hot surfaces, so theres no water on them to cause shorts

### Reply 5:
Can anybody explain what is the different between evaporative cooling system as compare to water cooler fan?

### Reply 6:
This reading might be interesting: <link>

### Reply 7:
Evaporative cooling relies on the amount of energy it takes to excite water from a liquid to a gaseous state. If you increase the humidity by say, 10% that means you are actively moving water into a gaseous state. This transition from liquid to gas requires energy, which lowers the temperature of the air.

### Reply 8:
Common PC water cooling systems use a metal radiator to dissipate heat into the air, it's the same as a normal heatsink but you're using water to move the heat away from the source instead metal conduction directly to the dissipation surface.Evaporative cooling makes use of the fact that it takes something like 970BTU to evaporate 1lb of water. If you have a large surface area covered with water and blow a fan over it, you get sensible temperature reduction from the energy taken to evaporate some of the water. It's much more efficient than a normal air conditioner but they don't get used much for air conditioning normally because it dumps a crapload of humidity in the air. Miners don't care so it can be an advantage.Also evaporative cooling effectiveness is inversely proportional to the humidity of the outside air. If it's already humid as shit outside, you don't get much gain with an evaporative cooler. In the desert, they work great

### Reply 9:
We use evaporative cooling on our house , and it use much less power around .75 kw per unit.And as aosmith said, if you have dry air you gain more cooling power.The evaporative cooling system used on that mining farm , is consist of two part the durable paper with continuous water above it and behind it there is a fan that suck the cold air come through that paper.

Which caused some problems at Facebook a few years ago.<link> systems, or simple weather changes on the outside (temperature during day and night, weather moving through) etc can cause problems, especially for power supplies.The Chinese farms have these problems on the large scale, along with dirt and pollution. But of course difficult (for them) to tell if it's just crap quality of components or simple physics at work.

### Reply 14:
Don't bother with evaporative cooling unless you live in an extremely dry environment. It is a very efficient method of cooling only if you don't have high humidity. Otherwise it just raises humidity levels without adding any significant cooling effect.I was very surprised to see evaporative cooling used in that private data center in Thailand that burned down. How did they think that would help with cooling at all?

### Reply 15:
It is because it was very cheap and it didn't take much electricity , and i think they may life in a dry area.

(6 gpus per client)Can I do this or is there another way I shud go about it? The average per gpu jumps around too much for my liking.Thank you.

### Reply 1:
You sure? Highlighted numbers are average per card AFAIK:

### Reply 2:
Yes but mine is constantly jumping around with very large variability . Is yours more stable? Upon further research I see a post where someone has mentioned switching to overclock makes the average more stable (6990) - ill test that out tho I wud prefer to keep it at 375W so I can predict electricity usage. In the meantime the average rate per gpu jumps around so much its ikpossible to gauge whether ur getting a small increase in hashing power.

### Reply 3:
The left figure (458.0) fluctuates a bit, I think its a 5s average; the right one that I highlighted (456.6), doesnt change at all (after running for a while). I think that is the average since starting the app?

Topic: So, how many people are switching away from deepbit?
### Original post:
With all this noise about deepbit controlling 50% or more of total mining power, I've seen a handful of people say that they've moved to other pools. I'd like to get a firm idea of how many people have done so.So, have you moved? If so, where?I had been meaning to experiment with deepbit's PPS model (I started on proportional), but with the controversy I decided to move over to eligius. Fees per share are lower there anyway.

### Reply 1:
I'm in eligus. Wanted to try it out anyway, and the fact that I'm supporting a pool that allows low fees is nice. And the fact that coins show up directly into my wallet is a big plus.I represent about 2gh/s

### Reply 2:
I might switch when my 5830 comes but I've been using deepbit so far.

### Reply 3:
The highest I saw was 548. Seeing as it's down to 526, it looks like the answer is not many.

### Reply 4:
it allows low fees for miners, that's true,but the fact that it doesn't allow ANY free transactions isn't that nice.it forces every bitcoin-user, may it be a miner or not, to pay transaction-fees.do you ever send free transactions?i hope you don't.

### Reply 5:
I took my 1Gh/s over to Eligius, I like getting the payout in block generation.

### Reply 6:
Even beyond the security problem, which is real imo, I don't understand why the miners who bailed out of slush's pool figured they should join the one pool with the highest fee oO""

### Reply 7:
We saw a roughly 15 Gh/s increase at BitcoinPool.com in the past 12 hours. So, a few... I can't account for the other pools.

### Reply 8:
btcmine.com shot up to 74""Eligius"" more than doubled to 40

### Reply 9:
It's understandable. I for one decided it would be best to evenly split up all my miners on various pool. Until now I had all my miners on slush's pool, then when that went down I moved the all to deepbit, but later I realized that with such a huge hash rate deepbit would not be in my best interest due to the very fast rounds. So my solution for now is to split half of the miners on some other pool and as for the others I'm not sure where to place them (still currently on deepbit). I think if everyone did this (distributed their hashing power on multiple pools) it would be better for the network. This way when one huge pool goes down for whatever reason it does not cause a huge and sudden drop in total network hash rate as the users scramble to find alternative pools to hop to. Also a mining proxy may be an even smarter solution. This is something I intend to look into this week.Happy mining everyone!

### Reply 10:
With the current limits used by most miners (including the big pools) no more than about 10 free transactions will ever be put into a block (because the software stops adding them when the block hits 4k) and less if there are also paying transactions. There are only 10 blocks solved an hour (well, more at the moment because the hashrate grew and difficultly will take another day or two to catch up).Some miners appear to be processing blocks without any transactions at all (except the generated transaction to pay them, of course), even though there are with fee transactions pending. (For example: <link> over the long term as the software is currently setup the network will only confirm 60 free transactions per hour. The backlog of free transactions went up to over 1000 several times last week. It only takes a _very_ small fee (0.00004096 BTC) to get included in Eligius blocks. It's pretty reasonable compared to the network's current inability to cope with many free transactions.I talked to Luke-Jr on IRC about the possibility of setting up a free tx fountain to pay miners to process free transactions, he pointed out that the fountain would need to have some heuristic to distinguish <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 11:
You also have to consider variance in the pools themselves. A quick look slush's graphs will show you that even though you'd expect a big pool to give you a steady daily payout, it isn't the case, and you'll good and bad days. Now, if pooling is about reducing variance, then spreading your miners on several pools is definitely the way to go, on top of the fact that it helps secure the network some more, which is the very reason there is a profit to make out of mining.

### Reply 12:
Yep, good point! Thanks for pointing that out. It is now my new policy to spread out my miners as widely as is reasonable. I wish though there were more pools out there. A few more pools, each with a total capacity around 50 Ghash would be a good thing IMHO.

### Reply 13:
Yep, I moved over to eligus.

### Reply 14:
i'm well aware of that and i don't think that miners processing blocks without any transactions at all are any better.it might take just a _very_ small fee, but even a _very_ small fee is a feeand how small it is highly depends on the amount you send and the balance you might (or might not) have left after you<rest of thread truncated>

Topic: Two S2 Antminers on the same network conflict - how to resolve?
### Original post:
I have two S2 Antminers (Bitmain) that I would like to run on the same network. I have set up miner #1 and have gotten it to hash successfully. When I then connect miner #2 with the same settings except for a different IP address (192.168.168.99 for #1 and 192.168.168.98 for #2). To my surprise, #2 can be pinged but it does not hash. I decided to try an experiment to test for some form of network conflict between the two miners as a cause for the failure to hash by #2. I disconnected the successfully hashing miner #1 from the network and I then used the known successful settings from the disconnected #1 to set up #2 which I connected to the network. With #1 disconnected, #2 promptly began hashing. From this I conclude that the reason that I can't get #2 to hash when #1 is connected to the network is because the two miners conflict in some way on the network, causing #2 to fail. Do you have any suggestions for how I can overcome this? To cover our home and outside areas, I have three Apple routers, one base station and two set as bridges. Thank you for any advice you are able to share. Justin

### Reply 1:
The miners will not conflict if they have different static ip addresses assigned to them. The likely cause of the problem is a conflict between something else on your network and the S2 with ip address 192.168.1.98.I've had this happen before, and you will get intermittent connectivity when two devices (not necessarily miners) have the same ip address on your network.

### Reply 2:
This can happen with some routers, when both devices have the same MAC address. Check if they have the same MAC address. If positive, do this:SSH into your S2, thenCode:ifconfig lan0 downmacchanger -r lan0ifconfig lan0 upas I am not familiar with antminers, I hope they have some decent distro installed, which will have the macchanger. If not, you'll have to try to install it.Code:sudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get install macchanger macchanger-gtk

### Reply 3:
Unplug the network for one of your units, log into the unit still connected to the network. Click on Network, when Edit (next to WAN), set the 192.168.1.99 address to a free address (192.168.1.100, etc). Click Save & Apply, you can now plug the other miner into the network and you won't have a conflict.

### Reply 4:
Thank you Cloverme for your suggestion. Your approach solved the problem. Much appreciated.Justin

### Reply 5:
Hi Psahx:I also tried your suggestions and, while the suggestion made by Cloverme solved my problem, studying the approach you outline was a great teaching exercise for me.Thank you for your efforts.Justin

### Reply 6:
Based on your first post, I have assumed you already got different IPs assigned to both of your devices. That is why I have suggested to try to see, if they have the same MAC (it happened to me before, with cloned NICs to have the same MAC).Glad you have got it figured out, anyway

### Reply 7:
So was there actually a device that was trying to use the same IP as the miner? Mobile phone or gaming system maybe?Glad you found a solution fast!

Topic: What about bad pool luck? Or maybe it's something else?
### Original post:
I have been trading a total of about 3TH on mainly Slush and BTC Guild.If you look at BTC pool luck chart for the last couple of weeks you will notice that their 'luck' has been underperformingway more than chance alone would indicate. Do not even care to speculate if there might be funny stuff going on.Slush often has a couple bad or good days in a row but never extreme ranges for extended periods.Any long term miners want to weigh in this with their opinions?

### Reply 1:
Sounds like someone is submitting fake shares on the pool, you should try check yourself by looking at the top 50 hash rate.

### Reply 2:
block witholding ?

### Reply 3:
The bolded part is not true. Do the math yourself or check with Organofcorti. It falls within a normal confidence interval.That being said yeah it's not pleasing. If you flip for who pays lunch and you lose 2 out of 3 times do you say the coin is rigged?There was a known withholding attack that ended a month ago and that messed up the 3 month stats. It is possible that somebody is repeating the attack but it is almost impossible to detect until after the fact.What's funny is that when BTCGuild had very good luck last year people were suspecting they were somehow cheating.If you're not happy you can try Slush or Bitminter. You luck may or not follow, depending on how superstitious you are.

### Reply 4:
BTC 1 month luck is 80%....really not acceptable in my opinion. Can make the diff between making or losing.Well I switched that hash power over to slush alone and my payouts are more in line where they should be.Anybody already come up with the 'optimal' allocation between pools?

### Reply 5:
Again, you are incorrect. Please look at the table correctly. 2 week luck is at 80%. 1 month is at 89%. The pool is now down to 6% of the network. The pool is run by Eleuthria who actually limited/stopped his growth when he got close to 40% just so as not to scare people with 51%. Ghash.IO hasn't bothered to inhibit its growth at all.

### Reply 6:
Thanks for the correction...But even making 20% less than expected for 2 weeks sucks, or does it not? While I am new to mining, I have 20 years experience with a hedge fund. Will talk to our risk management guys about this. I know this much, that we would go through our trade systems with a fine tooth comb if our performance swayed that much.

### Reply 7:
Well yes it sucks, but what can you do other mine somewhere else. You can't get mad you bet on red and the roulette wheel does black 8 times in a row (essentially another pool find more of the 2016 blocks then your pool).You can't eliminate variability. The only issue is whether o not something malicious is occurring at the pool either knowingly or unknowingly. Most pools have gone through this at one point or another. Back when difficulty was 9 million Ozcoin had a block that took 81 million shares, 9 times difficulty!!! That was what caused a lot of people to leave Ozcoin, but the pool still survives despite a theft of almost 1000BTC at one point.Eleuthria has nothing to gain really if his pool has bad luck - he makes more if it has good luck. I'm sure he would love to see the number go back to neutral or above, but you can't will it.Some people will jump onto the pool thinking it has had so much bad luck that it is due for a really good luck streak.

### Reply 8:
There could also be the possibility that there is equipment out there can't actually solve a block now? What proof is there that all equipment is capable of achieving a best share in the billions and all chips and mining equipment is equal? We are told it can? But can it really?If so where's the proof?We are just left with X companies word?Many companies could of very well just made short cuts because no one would be able to prove they did and chalk everything up too luck? sha 256 only uses 128 bit memory bus @ 2^128 which is limited to about 16 Billion as a 32 bit address is just approximately only 4 billion @ 2^32 so it is mathematically impossible for it too use every nonce numbered 1 to 16,800,000,000 at full capacity already it can't use every nonce so a short cut is already made somewhere?.I have read that there is equipment that is unable to use every nonce? This would make sense as a limiting factor?This might be the limiting factor on much of the equipment today? As earlier mining equipment was built with most likely a use of a limited amount of nonce's as it only needed to solve a best share in the millions and not expected billions?This very well can be the deciding fact<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 9:
Is it possible? Yes. Is it likely? No, and the proof is in the math.Now obviously the chips and mining equipment aren't 'equal'. Some will be faster (meaning it can make more attempts per second), some will be more energy efficient (meaning each attempt takes less energy), and some will have fewer hardware errors <rest of thread truncated>

Consider Myetherwallet as an interface to interact with your Ledger nano S. You will still need to enter the PIN to unlock your Ledger or confirm the transactions from the device. The addresses are yours, pre-generated from your seed.

The private-key is inside your Ledger. Putting in a simple way, MEW uses your public key (address) to see your balance and build the transaction, which its sent to the Ledger device, signed with the private-key and sent back to the computer, where its broadcasted. The private-key never leaves the device (reason why you can't see them, and why hardware wallets are so secure compared to normal desktop wallets).

Look at part 3 of that post:3) InstallVery simple install with the Raspberry PI I recieved from BlockC. It was set to DHCP so install was plug and play. I did change it to static IP as I like static with having multiple miners on my network. BlockC sending the Raspberry Pi with a default of DHCP saves you from the install process you did on the 4.1's if you did it yourself. It saved roughly 15 minutes or so and turned install into a breeze.For those who did not get the Raspberry Pi kit from BlockC here is a link to a DHCP Raspberry Pi image. All thanks goes to BlockC for the image. Just use a program such as Win32DiskImager and flash it to your SD card. Then insert SD card into Raspberry PI and you now have a DHCP Avalon 6 controller. Download is below:DHCP RPI Image: <link> the DHCP image that is BlockC's kit image and see if it does you some good.

Topic: Software to Monitor Cloud Hashing?
### Original post:
So i'm looking into selling some cloud hashing power to other friends of mine, but I was curious if there was any software anyone knew of that I could use to monitor the output of my devices (Since I wont have access to look at the miner on the pool of my friend's choice). Obviously I can see the CGMiner window when i'm around the hardware itself. But i'd like to find something that would alert me, hey miner x isn't sending throughput to the specific user. Thanks

Topic: AntMiner R4 Stopped working
### Original post:
my Antminer R4 (Antminer R4, Batch 5(7.5TH/s)) suddenly stopped working after reboot. i tried various options like reset using different methods but i cant get it to workeven the web based admin console was not reachable however afrer several reboots and holding the IP button i was able to connect to web based control panel...however strange problem is that i cant see the miner config screen though i can see other screensi updated firmware using web based console n got success message but still same problem persists...pfa screenshots and kindly advise ...<link>

### Reply 1:
too late you did firmware upgradei can't help you sorry.if you are usa based maybe bitmain warranty can help<link> r4 breaks alot and you muscled a firmware update on a broken r4.your best shot is bitmainwarranty good luck

### Reply 2:
is there a way to connect using ssh....

### Reply 3:
Too late .The r4 is very delicate,They break and break and break.Someone had a link that show how to reset to the original firmware.someone gave it to me it may work if you reset it.I will look for a link to the reset.In I reset it and it still did not work.I sent it in to bitmainwarranty and they did fix it.

### Reply 4:
You can ssh into it with username root and password admin.I doubt the firmware is causing this, at least, if it was installed correctly. I had an R4 controller fail and I replaced it with an S9 controller, flashing it with the R4 firmware and it works fine. If the image was installed properly, and your controller isn't broken, it should be working. Make sure you don't have anything preventing javascript from running on that page.The ""ant_data=;"" you see in the miner configuration page is there because the header has an inline script that begins with Code:echo ""ant_data = ${ant_result};"" The script is fetching cgi data from the config saved in <truncated> For some reason it is failing at that point.

Topic: ISP disconnected my internet because of mining
### Original post:
Ok so here's my issue I live in Manitoba, Canada and realistically there's only 2 ISP's MTS and Shaw. I currently have MTS and a few days ago whilst I had stopped mining due to not having the right setup at the moment to keep everything cool my ISP decided to disconnect my Internet. Seeing as this has never happened before I called MTS. After waiting for an hour and talking to level 2 Tech Support they informed me that my IP address was flagged by their system and was disconnected because their system believed I was performing a DDoS attack. This all happened once i took my miner offline after 3 days of hashing. So my question is are there any ways where I can setup my miner (Antminer S3) so that it doesn't flag my IP as doing a DDoS attack and my lose my internet connection again.

### Reply 1:
I'm fairly certain your IP was flagged for a different reason than mining.Maybe your computer is infected with some kind of malware and is part of a botnet?You can't really be attacking by yourself so it doesn't really make sense to flag your IP.

### Reply 2:
It sounds like you probably had a virus on another system or something else other than your miner. Your miner would never be able to perform a DDoS attack, just like it couldn't surf the Web and watch YouTube videos. They have one specific thing they can do, and that would be mining. I would call them back and ask which computer/system it was and ask if they have any proof at all that it was actually done by you or if it was done remotely.

### Reply 3:
there are only 2 other computers on my network and i have been through each of them with a fine tooth comb i even looked into the other devices like the two cell phones and the KODI box as well as my Pi-Hole and nothing. When i spoke to them about the flag their system analyzes the traffic coming in and going out from my IP and the traffic was consistent with a DDoS attack and further evidence points to the miner because since having the miner disconnected i haven't had my internet cut off. I have changed nothing except disconnect the miner from the network and that has my internet back up and running fine.

### Reply 4:
Guess it's time to speak to customer retention or switch ISPs.

### Reply 5:
ya switching ISP's is not an option i save a bunch of money on my cell bill by having them as my ISP plus Shaw Cable has a limit of 1 TB which i would go over in a flash with the amount of stuff i do on my laptop and on my network in general was more looking for a way that instead of using TCP i can use UDP instead the flagging system only monitors TCP traffic

### Reply 6:
Use a good proxy/VPN/vps and problem solved.

### Reply 7:
any recommendations for a good proxy?

### Reply 8:
I use expressvpn in canada, you can install them on the router.I am also in MB, on mts.At one time I had 30 miners running for a few months.It was not the miner that set them off, could of been a hack, I'd ask for more details, tell them you scanned and fixed anything (say you found something onw ifes pc etc. or some lie so they give up) and they should reactivate you.The mts guys are tools. hate dealing with them, but shaw has data caps....Edit:didn't see post that i was back on.Vpn for sure. likely one of their people being a knob, not even sure you can install malware on a miner lol

### Reply 9:
Just came across thisfigured it may answer your question<link>

### Reply 10:
You should call your isp and ask them for the ip that they thought you were ddosing. If it is not the ip of the pool you were mining on then it was not from mining but probably a virus.

Topic: GUIMiner Problems
### Original post:
Hello friends,I hate to sound like such a newbie...but in fact I am. I have implemented the GUI GUIminer and have connected to Slush's pool mining. The problem is I can't seem to get my video cards into the act. The GUIminer is showing me at 720 MHash/sec but my video cards are showing no load activity or temperature increases.It is almost as though only my CPUs are working. I can't find anywhere in the GUIMiner by ""Kiv"" how to make the video cards get into the game.Does anyone know enough about this to help me?Thanks

### Reply 1:
Well if you are indeed mining at 720Mhash then it is highly unlikely that only your CPU is doing the mining as most CPU's can only mine at around 2-3Mhash.

### Reply 2:
Also mining BTC at this point with anything but asic devices is pointless unless just for learning for a short time.What ""device"" is selected in your drop down window? This is the device that is mining.If you are getting 720Mh/s out of your video card on slush's pool there is a reasonable chance that it can actually be profitable mining scrypt alt coins depending on your power costs, but we need more info.What is your video card?

How many avalons do you have? My calculations show that 2 avalons should be making about 9 coins a day. But that's in perfect world...

Even 2 Bitcoins per day it will only cost you less than 2 months to get the investment back. Don't forgetthe price is still rising and we still have 3 years of current payment of 25 Bitcoin per block.

### Reply 7:
I just don't buy this...no one rationally does that in a commercial concern....they must be mining the crap out th BC before they sell them.[/quote]Avalon ASICs are manufacturing at least 100TH/sec of mining resource. That's a comfortable majority of the network. Confidence drops in the bitcoin network because one entity is in control. The price of bitcoin plummets because no one wants any part of a tainted network. Avalon get thousands of coins worth $0.0000001.From a commercial perspective, those working in the bitcoin currency are sensitive to the public's confidence in the currency. Avalon would be cutting their own throat if they mined with no competition.

if you would have a machine which could produce diamonds the size of a child's head - would you have interest to flood the market with it?

### Reply 9:
Even at 1btc a day mined thats less than 3 months back of the 75btc, even 0.5btc a day is a good deal. Or are you talking about the reward with mining with more than 1 avalon?

### Reply 10:
The thing is that is very difficult to make long-term projections on hashrate, this is why an estimatetion of ""3 months for ROI"" doesn't sounds that good in bitcoin world nowadays, while in the ""fiat"" world a 3 months ROI is an increadible deal.While you wait for batch #3, 2.5 months can pass. 3 months from that other players could be adding THs to the network, and difficulty could just skyrocket.Paying 20BTC for a 65GHs machine you will receive in 2.5 months or less is almost a no-brainer. Paying 75BTC is risky if you are in only for the profits, it's very likely that you will profit much more HOLDING those bitcoins.

### Reply 11:
When we ordered our Batch 1 Avalon in September, we started from an ROI of more than 6 months, as we had to accept that BFL and BAsic will be long on the market. And now here you talking about a risk if the ROI could be 1-3 months! Hello people!

### Reply 12:
Well, BFL could also hit the market in the meanwhile. But I surely doubt it

### Reply 13:
The ones selling the spades during gold rushes makes the most.

### Reply 14:
Bingo. 75BTC is guaranteed money right now for Avalon. It's also about 5x the price of the first batch at current BTC prices.

### Reply 15:
you guys are also assuming profitability based on current prices. If indeed we are in a huge btc bubble and it pops...avy may very well end up making not much / day. Meaning that .5BTC could be nearly worthless =( and that would suck.

### Reply 16:
and yet they are selling AA's for BTCso they don't seem to worried about that.

### Reply 17:
Except this time the gold can't get put into the banks, or confiscated.

### Reply 18:
Well, I bought my Avalon in BTC, and I want a ROI in BTC. I don't give a damn about btc/fiat exchange rate.

### Reply 19:
I am concerned about ASICMINER and their growth to 200 TH. If it is indeed true and so far they seem to be on schedule, the Avalons likely will still break even but the ROI time will be much more uncertain.<link> hope for the end-user sake, the Avalon team can get the machines out faster with the new equipment they're putting in!

### Reply 20:
Don't forget everyone gets hurt when the difficulty goes up but if you have a long enough time horizon, the box should ROI. 12 months is fine if that is what it takes.

He might have sold you an unit which is affected by firmware virus. If he claims that he does not know what is wrong, that is probably because he was in same boat as you.

Ancient history, I suppose that was possible. I do recall the MM flashing not being clean and having to repeat it a couple of times on some of the PIs. Guess I missed that unit when checking.Thanks again.

### Reply 6:
Thanks for catching that. The problem child was the ONLY unit running the older MM. Not sure how it was missed when I upgraded last time.After re-flashing MM, the unit appears to be working fine.RE: Power... I've come to trust the PG ratings displayed on Avalons. Anything other than 15 is a problem that I fix. This unit was 15.

### Reply 7:
Did you flash the pi first and then the MM's?, it might have started one of it's restart loops while the upgrade was in progress. I've never had that happen but I have had the restarts interfere with commands.But glad it's working now.

Either I was too quick on the draw or you have not updated the version string as a fresh git clone tells me I will compile a version 2.9.6.

### Reply 1:
You're right, it wasn't tagged. Tagged now (and be aware it's on the 2.9 branch).

### Reply 2:
The rewrite of how work is gathered into a getwork scheduler is well underway and in the git master tree now undergoing testing. It would not be surprising if it introduces new instability, but I'm hoping for the master branch to be tested and debugged over the next week paving the way for the next version. For what it's worth, it's currently running fine for me. Other goodies including new mmq and ztex code are in there too.

### Reply 3:
Just experienced a crash with cgminer 2.9.7 on Windows. Two miners crashed at the same time. I'm using stratum on BitMinter. Didn't have any crashing problems before with 2.9.x versions, and I saw this on the patch notes:""Windows builds are built and shipped with a new libcurl (and libusb) dll that hopefully improves stability.""Could this be actually causing problems instead of improving stability? If it's possible, I'd be interested in trying out a build with the old dlls.

### Reply 4:
No, likely it's the same windows special crash to do with internet going down which has been there a while. The new dll was there in the hope it fixed this, but obviously it does not. Anyone debugging on windows could you try the instructions and builds in <link> and use the debug build of libcurl dll that's in there as well please. Thanks.

### Reply 5:
I just did a git pull to update cgminer on my rigs, and I noticed that it says I'm running version 2.10.0. Did I time warp to the future?

### Reply 6:
Nope. It's not tagged as such, but it's there to demonstrate the substantially different code base if anyone's running it. That will be the version when it is finally released. Release versions are tagged in git (except when I forget to do it).

Any idea why 2.9.7 seems to crash every 10 hours, while 2.9.6 ran just fine untouched for days? I'm on my normally w7, 4x7970 set up.

### Reply 11:
The only crashes I have seen with 2.9.7 is when a backup stratum pool goes down, back up and then down again. If the backup pool stays down or stays up, it doesn't seem to crash.

### Reply 12:
<Farnsworth>Good news everyone</>Okay after a day of debugging on windows, I found the disconnect crash bug was actually in libcurl itself, which was rather awkward but anyway it means it should get better if you download and use the following dll instead:<link> put it into your cgminer directory, replacing the existing libcurl dll.EDIT: I've repackaged the 2.9.7 release for win32 as 2.9.7-1 including the fixed dll. I urge anyone on windows to update at least the dll. The package is otherwise the same version of cgminer.EDIT2: Bug submitted to curl maintainers so hopefully it will be fixed next version: <link>

New release: Version 2.10.0, 10th December 2012Huge upgrade of lots of code and features, so comes with the usual warnings about potential instability of the new version.Human readable changelog:The main change to this is a completely new work scheduler where all work spawns from. The old work scheduler would spawn threads that all tried to grab work as best as they could, and this would lead to much more work than necessary being grabbed from getwork pools, and potentially hitting the pool at precisely the same time from multiple threads making a getwork failure more likely. It was also very difficult to track how much work was really available at any one time since all the threads were off doing their own thing. Centralising the work creation means it is strictly tracked now and as soon as one work item is taken, the scheduler will generate or download another one. The advantage here is to maximise the amount of work we can get from any source, be it getwork without rolltime, with rolltime, gbt, or stratum, or combinations of the above. It is also much less likely to have dips in providing work, should lead to less getwork failures, and scale to higher hashrates even with the old<rest of post truncated>

Topic: eVGA Supernova 1300 jumper clip
### Original post:
I have a eVGA SuperNova 1300 that I've been using for a while. I had a jumper wire between two pins on the back to allow the unit to turn on.Originally I found a picture that showed where to place the wire. I am searching but can't seem to find the picture or description where to putthe jumper wire. I would appreciate if someone could provide this information so I can get that PSU up and running again.Or if you can simply take a picture of your PSU with the wire in place, that would be great.Thanks in advance,Tom Travis

### Reply 1:
Here are a few sites - <link> and <link> With the EVGA 1300 I believe it's a all black wire if it's like mine so you would need to make sure your looking at motherboard power cord in the right direction. And then count to find the spot as there is no green/black as normal colors.

### Reply 2:
this is not a technical support question. this is a miner support question.belongs here<link> for what pins. the evga 1300 comes with a jumper I will photo the jumper give me a few minutes.note I asked mods to move this.and these photo should be your answer

### Reply 3:
Another useful option is to look for an ""ATX Power Supply Jumper"" on Ebay or Amazon. Yes, it costs more than a paper clip, but makes things so much easier. Less than $5.

### Reply 4:
Still not getting it.... It was simple the first time around.I thought I read something off the eVGA support site that said on the 1300, if you put a jumper in the hole just below the ""V"" in EVGA and also the one to the right..... I am not sure, but it worked before.I do not have a motherboard cable for it and all the pictures show the motherboard end. I want to jump it right at the power supply with no cable.Thanks,Tom

### Reply 5:
Thanks,I got it to work, but 11 & 12 is not what you have in the picture with the clip. Your clip is in position 10 & 11.11 & 12 are one in from the edge (next to other connector), on the clip side, and are Green/PowerOn and Black/Ground.

### Reply 6:
yeah I had an oversize paperclip it popped out 2 times and the last time I got it to stick in I did not realize it was shifted over one hole. It still worked which was impressive.I bent the paper clip better today and shifted it over one. it now works. I am pulling those photos.

Topic: Innosilcon is trying to get rid of heavily used miners
### Original post:
Innosilicon is offering ""manufacturer refurbished"" T3+ and other miners. I ordered a T3+ 57T Bitcoin miner. I had to wait for 4 weeks after I paid in full in Bitcoin until they shipped it out. When it arrived it was in horrible condition: <link> of dust, with scratches, stains, missing screws, rattling parts, rust...The firmware was locked and I was not able to enter my own pool settings. There was plenty of evidence that this miner was not manufacturer refurbished, not even cleaned. Otherwise at least the firmware would have been reset. Innosilicon has 3 departments: while the support is trying to help to unlock the miner, the sales and order team tells me: ""This is what you get when you order from us. Deal with it!""

### Reply 1:
I think other ppl here ordered the refurb T3s. Would be great to have their feedbacks!

### Reply 2:
Yes, please. Who else bought a refurb T3+ ? What was your experience?

### Reply 3:
have you ever got to the bottom of the pool settings being pre-completed and not updating ?also, sorry to hear about your experience, I hope it all goes well in the end

### Reply 4:
Yeah, they use the term refurbished for a miner that was damaged and repaired by them or something returned and they've set it back running. They did warn a bit but you didn't take the warning seriously, usually in those cases light scratches mean run over by an excavator:Sucks and if I were in your place, even if support manages to help you unblock the settings I would play possum and try to get a refund and send it back. I won't be surprised if that thing wouldn't break in a few months, external scratched and missing screws ain't a big deal but you should take a look inside if possible and have a beer nearby when you do

### Reply 5:
Refurbished miners could be a great bargain if you get a diamond in the rough with no issues but that is playing a dangerous game if there is no warranty attached to them. Depending on the price and time to get to you it may pay itself off quickly but if it breaks it could quickly become a paperweight or something that ends u costing what a new unit would plus the downtime to ship it back for repairs. Would love to hear feedback as well from anyone who bought one.

### Reply 6:
Those Innosilicon refurbished miners are 6 months garanty

### Reply 7:
You are right with the firmware lock, but this is a straight-out scam if you ask me, these were supposed to be ""manufacturer refurbished"", the ones in the video don't look anything like it, in fact, REAL refurbished miners are a lot more expensive than clean used miners, a while back used S9js were going for $250 while the refurbished once were going for at least $400, but those looked as good as new, no scratches, no lost screws, everything seemed like brand new, the miner in the video is a Used Miner with C- condition, selling it as a refurbished piece is nothing but scam IMO.

### Reply 8:
Looks like this is a rare problem that has happened before.There are threads about a T2 miner that had it on here.. also one on the russian mining board:<link> might need to do a translate on it with your browser)Post 11 reads:Maybe worth reaching out. Seems they found someone at Inno that can unlock it remotely for you.

Watching some videos from your YouTube channel and I like the soundproofing you have setup. I'd probably be mining with more hashrate at my home if I had such a setup as well. I should also mention that I thought for a second this was a bodybuilding YouTube channel instead of being about Bitcoin mining. From the look of your biceps I thought you might go hulk and crush that thing when it wasn't working.

### Reply 10:
Interesting , they do that constantley , I heard that their ceo is a close friend to the founder of ETH

### Reply 11:
Figured they would carry some sort of limited warranty. That said, considering Inno was made aware of the Fixed Address issue on at least some miners and quickly responded by putting out a fix for it one can't fault them for their response on that part. They also said they were going to issue a mass email to all customers who bought one of the refurbed miners to notify of them of the possible problem and fix for it if they received a miner that was locked. Hopefully the OP just got a miner that had already been shipped just before Inno became aware of the problem and the miner had yet yet been updated to OEM firmwareMy take on things is that the miners are of course from some of the farms in China that got shut down. It makes sense that a farm would use locked firmware to make sure there is (near) zero chance of miners being hijacked either through hacking or actual theft. If stolen, as soon as the miner goes on line Inno will know which miner and what the ip address is.Biggest problem is Inno dropping the ball on making sure the miners are at least cleaned up and along with that definitely reset back<rest of thread truncated>

Topic: Overheat Protection for Antminer S5 50cent cheap, 100% safe and easy to install!
### Original post:
Hi friends,after many months of bitmain's refuse patch a bug which causes fatal overheat to our S5 during internet connection fail I decided to make my own protection independent to miner software and not void our warranty. So again, THIS MOD WILL NOT BREAK YOUR WARRANTY. Just remove this mod before RMA.If you ask how, the answer is super easy - bi-metal thermostat, similar which is used in professional lighting devices, battery packs and many other devices which needs reversible protection fuse. I purchased it from e-bay, for example: 10PCS KSD9700 Bimetal 90 Degrees NC Temperature Control Switch For Transformers<link> pcs for less than 5 bucks with free shipping! You can use any temperature you wish to shut your Antminer down, but it MUST BE ""NC"" version - Normally Closed. This one shutted my S5 at 101C which is still acceptable as critical overheat temperature. This switch will shut down PSU, so NO POWER comes to your S5 until it cools down about 10 minutes, then it power on your S5 back.<link> bimetal switch between heatsinks.<link> not remove the silicon sleeve, it prevents the switch to move out.<link> your paper clip from your PSU and connect the your new bimetal switch on p<rest of post truncated>

This looks like a good solution. 90 degrees between the heatsink is very hot. 80 would be enough imo. Good work!

This is the best hint I've seen.Simple and genious.Thanks!

### Reply 3:
the idea is cheap but to be really sure do two things the op's and Just add a fan as a pullconnect it to your psu for power not the s-5 and leave the stock fan connected to your s-5.<link> cents plus 4 bucks = $ 4.50 a minerpretty much fool proof with the two combined

### Reply 4:
Thanks! The chips survive extreme temperature while running, I had some failed due to internet connection lost and some chips were unsoldered (about 180C at chip package, so die could be 200+). After pressing them back to PCB hash board worked again. That is why I choosed 90C. It is up to one's decision which temp is safe.I think it is very clever idea to remove side panels and check temperature of each chip during operation to make sure all chips are cooled properly. I found some chips are over 100C while S5 shows 55C only. Repasting helped a bit.

### Reply 5:
A Very Helpful method, Thanks mate for sharing.

### Reply 6:
waw great idea man.. it cheap too, thanks for your idea, i will order it.

### Reply 7:
Yes, doubling or quadrupling fans make it yet more fool proof. You can also quadruple fans and each of added connect to separate PSU connected to three different UPS each at different network phase

### Reply 8:
I have an S5 that managed to burn a chip. If bitmain honours their warranty and send me a new one, this will be implemented.This is a reasonable alternative to using aftermarket fans. The issue I see with aftermarket fans is they may not provide the same CFM air transfer as the stock fan unless mounted in some less than conventional configuration, such as 4x fans set up in a contra-rotating fashion (two per end - soldering fun).(see <link>

### Reply 9:
Wow I did not know that such a component existed.Ordering now.... Thanks.Make a new BTC Address (just for privacy issues on your wallet) and post it in your signature and I will make a small contribution.I tested all of my S5's for the overheating due to loss of internet and found some that will.If i disconnect the Cat 5 Cable or Power down my switch/hub then all my miners will eventually stop hashing and will cool.If I just reboot my ISP cable modem then some of my miners will get extremely hot (over 85c) and not Auto Shutdown even though I have ""Stop running when temprerature is over 80"" checked.It is like they think the Pool is still live because the Cat-5 cable is still connected to a live connection (in this case just a switch) but it has nowhere to send the hashes.as soon as the WAN becomes active the S5's start to cool on their own because the hashes are now getting sent to the pool.I was concerned if I ever lost my internet connection for more than a couple of minutes. how many miners would I lose.With this easy solution I am greatly relieved, and cant wait to receive them and install these switches.

### Reply 10:
I prefer my 0 cost method, especially since I want the fans to run at 100% constantly anyway for maximum cooling and maximum lifespan of the S5.

Great idea. I wonder if there's any way to adapt that to use the server power supplies.

Of course you can. Just wire the switch(s) in series with the PSU's control pins and your external on/off switch. If you are using the GekkoScience breakouts for IBM 2 or 2.8kw PSU's the control switch will select either local (just the switch) or external control.

Where or what pool do you mine? Check carefully if you pasted it with extra spaces or letters because the miner will not work properly if the Url has extra spaces or extra letters.Another thing is your internet may be very slow and unstable plus the pool server you use has a high ping.Why not test it with BraiinsOS? If your concern is you don't know to put it back to stock firmware why not just boot the miner with an SD card instead of flashing it directly to the nand?

### Reply 2:
Brainspool as with all my other miners, all pool details are correct,I have messaged seller and he has stated to try hard reset, then upgrade.Also i'll download the file and try the run from SD card.CheersUPDATE 1 -I changed the pool details from older slushpool to newer brainspool and it's working?When i entered the original details i just copy/pasted from a miner already running on older slushpool urls? UPDATE 2 -To run from SD card i presume you still need to move jumper 4?Can someone confirm this please.ThanksI always copy from the same miner out of habit....Very OddAlso where are the details to downgrade from Brains to the older Bitmain FW i have 500, 550, 600, 650 fixed plus variable FW that i used to use and i find some boards will only run on older FW?I can't find the downgrade guide, i presumed flashing BrainsOS would remove the SSH lock and allow you to flash anything?Cheers

### Reply 3:
Why don't you just go check and read the braiins documentation about reverting or flashing it back to factory firmware?Check this link <link> about JP4 if you just want to boot it to braiins without flashing it then you need to download the right firmware there are two options to download, the one is ""auto-install to nand"" and ""Run from SD card"" download the ""Run from SD card"" and paste the contents to SD. And then if you want to boot it don't forget to move the JP4 it is the same as how you flashed the unit before but this time if you move the JP4 to the original position then the miner will boot to the original firmware.

### Reply 4:
Thanks, that's the link i was looking for, i could not find it. I fully understand the process to upgrade via SD card and run from SD card now, plus you have to flash the image not paste to the SD.Even after reading it i'm totally confused as it uses uses command lines etc and SSH? I was hoping to find an explanation for this tbh as once i have done it once i presume i will understand and find it relatively easy and i can help others like you.Even afetr reading how to 'downgrade' and have the old 'Community Edition' FW that i thimnk they now label it i do not understand how to flash it..Thanks for replying and being undertanding, i'm getting there slowly, the tjought of installing BrainsOS seemed complicated at first now i find it simple.Hopefully i can do the same to downgrade and understand how to use these commands and flash back older 'community fw' i have.....

### Reply 5:
You don't need to ""install"" Braiins OS to try it, just run directly from SD, no need to touch NAND ever.You should go with Braiins OS+ which is very simple, you really only need to set up the pool and set a lower power limit value (such as 1280W).With manual values you can easily damage your machine if you are not careful. Defaults should work but for testing you should at least lower the speeds (defaults to 650Mhz). Remember that there is no support with the community edition, you are on your own.Considering you are using Braiins Pool you should go with Braiins OS+, since the 2% pool fee is returned to you when you use Braiins OS+ with it.This won't happen with the Community edition or other firmware, you<rest of thread truncated>

While I can not rule that out, the 33 other machines in the room seem to suggest different. Obviously the board is NOW dirty, cap blew dust everywhere. Guess I need to pull a board tonight.. JOY!!Really I would say the heatsink came loose/ lost contact to that section of the board. Since I was unable to speak to machine had to do a hard reset, the temp of that asic bank was probably reason for machine hanging. Lesson I suppose is after a few months of ops, you should tighten mount points. Now where is my SP10 manual, maybe their website.. HAHAHA LMAO yep ""The best CS and most professionally built"".Might want to shut your SP10's down for a quick inspection!

Ok, so you want to play the part of being an intelligent human being? I got you covered.First, [all!] Electronics fail. Yes, even medical grade electronics that are critical for sustaining a life. (redundant electronics necessary)Second, you seem ""surprised"" because an SP10 caught fire, you therefore seem to consider it an issue of quality.You also stated ""you were lucky"" because you were there to pull the plug. (?) <--I am guessing you aren't properly hosting said device to be worried about burning down the place where you host them.Not taking appropriate precautions is the bigger issue to keep in <truncated> I see your SP10 did fail, (like all electronics from all manufacturers eventually will).The question is, how often do these fail when operated properly.I don't recall seeing many SP10's failing in this board. So I assume they are safe enough.But don't take that as a sense of false relief, instead be prepared for when they do fail.You stated you have ~40 some Ant miners. I am guessing you haven't set those up either in case of a fire in one unit.Again, you don't sound like you are prepared for that <truncated> --> STOP overreacting.There are no hardware from all these manufact<rest of post truncated>

LOL You have an amazing ability to remote view my mind and my data room, WOW!I did not say Thx GOD, because I was afraid something was going to destroy my place. Even it I had let her burn at best it would have caused the building to stink. But hey thx for the free anal-lysis it was really helpful.Likewise I agree shit fails, the difference is will it catch a blaze. I have had several ants fry the difference being they popped, smoked, dead. This SP10, like the AM Turds, caught a blaze which did not extinguish without aid. Thus FIRE STARTER!

Sometimes stating the obvious is necessary.Try not to make a fool of yourself.

### Reply 14:
What on Earth are you saying? How do you even know one thing about my preparedness?

### Reply 15:
I've had two SP10s in my custody for hosting since about July, and this has happened to me three times (twice on one machine). One of them blew a VRM in January when the intake temps were about 14C. That grey bead to the uppper right corner is the only connection between your VRM/bank and the 12V rail, which means if you're worried just remove it and thew hole burnt section is now electrically cut off. Both my SP10s still work at reduced capacity.

### Reply 16:
When we're talking about fire, is it safe to assume that this one self extinguished?

### Reply 17:
Thanks for that HELPFUL comment sidehack, that would be best case to save the remainder of the board's functionality.

Negative, had to pull from rack and extinguish with wet towel. Did not want to over react and kill the room.

Nothing really changed, so try using different firmware. Also, do not hope for PSU. Bitmain will NEVER send you parts on their own even if you beg. You either buy it and hope it is the fix or you RMA it. But before that try firmwares and check visually tomorrow.

First one is odd one. Looks like failed tune. I'd try custom firmware for it.Second one is even odder one. It noticed the second hashboard at start and then after voltage check it just decided to ignore it... Try checking if PSU has good connection with your hashboards and check all the cables, especially the ones that are for data.Also, a little bit of history on units would be useful. Are units new? Did you modify them or clean them in any way? Did you try custom firmwares on those machines? What voltage are you using? I assume it's 220v.

Both new. the first one was a replace from bitmain and the other one from june. I clean them two days ago gently with a painting brush the front part they were working perfect and the error ocurred after electricity was gone like one day ago never custom firmware and voltage always 220.

### Reply 4:
Could be when electricity went down (and maybe up in same time) voltage hurt the PSU. Everything I said still stands. Try custom firmware with underclock and check the cables but if they are new from Bitmain, cables should be placed perfectly. PSU is connected via plates, they should be connected well, and it should be easy to differentiate Data cables and Fan cables. I do not know of any specific video, but you could look into ""teardown of Antminer S17"" or something like that on youtube. Otherwise, you can just start unscrewing screws and make sure you do not forget which go where as there are different ones (take pictures).Or if you are scared to do that, just skip that part and try custom firmware and RMA the units if even that doesn't help, or just RMA right now.Also, it should be obvious, but you should have already tried different PSU cables as well as rebooting miners 2-3 times just to make sure it isn't a bug in software (not that they happen often or ever for that matter).You could also try different power outlets.There is 20+ threads similar to yours which have problems with 17th series, so you can check them for more tips.Also, if you cleaned them gently as you say (with<rest of post truncated>

This thread is for reporting hard numbers of how many mh/s the newest catalyst is taking away from your mining. Please post your card, software, etc, with as many numbers as you have. 11.11 and 11.2 Catalyst both steal mining speed and may or may not fix the 100% cpu bug.

I'll confirm from past experience that anything past 10 aggression causes high CPU, but only on single card setups. Multicard setups have cpu bug no matter what for me. People say cpu bug is gone on the very newest AMD APP 2.6 + OpenCL 1.2 + Catalyst 11.12/12.1, but I can't justify the huge hash speed loss over maybe 10-15 watts since I'm already hugely underclocking my cpu from 2.4ghz to 800mhz.Gaming PC - Sapphire 5830 Xtreme - 950/1125 24/7 - Mine off and on depending on gaming activities, about 295 mhash when not using PC @ aggression 5.

Currently ~315/~480/501mhash @ aggression 14. CPU bug persist across all aggressions.

### Reply 2:
I'm running 11.12 but regressed to SDK 2.4 and I'm running at full speed on my dual GPU 5970. But with the latest and greatest SDK (whatever came with 11.12) I was down about 50 MH/s per core. If you want to try going back to an earlier SDK, you might want to try deleting the following files <truncated> some reason these files aren't removed if you do a complete ATI uninstall (at least for me they weren't).

### Reply 3:
Thank you to Mousepotato for providing the list of files to remove before downgrading the OpenCL runtime. Previous attempts at reverting had failed to recover lost performance.I've now regained ~20MH/s on a 5850 and ~10MH/s per 5830.Edit:I'd forgotten that I'd switched to the phatk kernel since it seemed to perform better with 11.12's OpenCL runtime version. Switching back to phatk2 with the 2.4 runtime yields +5 MH/s/card.

Be careful I tried to check their few pages it seems that their website is not finished yet there are some pages that do not have content and after checking the source code of the website they are using CMS WordPress. And most of the product they sell looks like used units that do not exist. They are also selling Innosilicon units which don't have any support anymore.So there is a high chance that this website is scam.If you are looking for cheap units why not buy directly from Canaan they have pretty cheap units with the same hash rate.

Good to know. This mod makes the S1s theoretically cheaper per Ghash than the S2 without sacrificing much power consumption.

### Reply 8:
According to Jim above's volt mod experience S2 are still much better for power consumption for not much more BTC which i foresee batch 3 to be priced around $3000.1000gh / 165 = 6.061 x 277 wall watts = 1678 watts6.061 x S1's = 5.41 BTCNow add the cost of all the power supplies needed for 6 x S1's and the S2 batch 3 will clearly be the smarter option by far.

Is there any way to connect that board to RPi or even to existing and working S1 ?Thank you very much

there may be a way to connect it to an upcoming S2 unit if they simply modified the voltage/clocks on the current blade design.

Yeah, i cant think of anyway that you could connect it to an S1. AFAIK neither:a) cgminer settings are capable of detecting more than 2 boardsb) 2 cards cannot share a dataline for double hashrate. you would either see a lot of duplicate throwaways or HW errors. I do not think it is a 'shared comms' type of connection where multiple boards in parallel would be capable of sharing instructions or hashing 'n-times' faster

Has nobody overclocked or overvolted an S2 yet?640 chips (an S1 has 64 chips), 16 chips per TPS53355 regulator (S1 has 8 per)S1 was forcing around 30A through the regulator at stock speeds, and up to 40A with overclocking and some overvolting (based on some of the 210GH+ reports in this thread)S2 is putting about 22-24A on the regulator at stock. Presumably with a bit of voltage modding and overclocking the regulators could handle up to about 1.4TH/2kWonly issues:1) power. To seriously overclock, adding a 600W+ PSU will be necessary2) cooling. More fans and/or individual chip heatsinks are necessary to properly exhaust any extra heat since the units read 50C+ temperatures stock2b) PCI entenders. Looks like the boards are all mounted using PCI (PCIe 16x?) slots. if you used some risers (with a nice pair of 14AWG power cables to protect the risers) you could get the boards up out of the case and arrange them with airflow directly aimed at the heatsinks for better cooling.I can't wait for my batch 2 unit to arrive - if noone overclocks by then I might have to be the first. (donations will be accepted in case i kill my miner :p)

I have undervolted my Antminer to 1,0V (R3 = 3.9kOhm) and I am really happy with results. Before mod my antminer was consuming 348W on the wall on 180GH/s but now it takes only 260W on 165GH/s.So 8,3% performance decrease means 25.3% power input decrease. Nice I am running about hour now and no HW errors at all. I also tried 180GH/s with lowered voltage, but a lot of HW errors resulted in 170GH/s output performance too.Mod was really easy. 10 minutes of work and everything worked on the first try.Thanks for the guide.

### Reply 17:
What are the risks of undervolting?I don't know the physics of it, so please excuse my ignorance 1. If I undervolt but do not underclock, what will happen? Will HW errors simply increase, or do I risk the antminer<rest of thread truncated>

Topic:  How to solve ""Pool 0 not providing work fast enough"" when Solo mining ?
### Original post:
In CGMiner you can increase your ST (Staged Work) by increasing your queue by going to settings and then queue and increase it from the default of 1 to 90 or so. That will help. Also setup some backup pools so that when Bitcoin-QT doesn't supply work fast enough you miner can leak some shares to standard pools. That way it's not a complete loss.Also the only share you will see submitted to the solo will be block solves. So not seeing any accepted shares is normal operation for solo mining.Sam

### Reply 1:
Hi Sam,I increase cgminer queue to the maximum 90, then the message is gone. Is it necessary to tuning its work queue as minimum or I can use queue with 90 without the effect? Do you have any command recommend to add more in bitcoin.conf to increase luck or performance?

### Reply 2:
I don't use the .conf file myself. I use ""-Q 10"" command line switch then manually increase it when I start the miner. The .conf file may allow larger values then the command line.As for tuning, I don't know how much difference other values will make. I use a queue of 60 to 120 as seems to vary how busy it keeps my BE's. You have allot more hashrate than I do with my meager 20GHs or so.Just make sure your client has as many connections as possible.Good Luck,Sam

### Reply 3:
Hi Sam,I got the message again in next 10 minutes but the message occurred quite slower than using its default queue. That it means my bitcoin-qt reaches its capacities in the current environment, I have to set up backup pool follow your recommended.I don't know the other persons face this problem like me that using bitcoin client on Windows7 Virtual machine. Is it not generate the issue incase not using Virtual machine or using other OS? Anyone can confirm that solo mining is working normally on Windows7 when having hashing load at 140GH/s up?Note: Currently, I only have Macbook Pro with small hard disk so it needs to use VMware in case.ThanksPaulK

### Reply 4:
What many people do who solo mine with high hash rates it so setup their own pool software. That's more complex than I want to get. So I just mine with the occasional ""Pool 0 not providing work fast enough"" message and not worry too much about it. And setup failover pools to take up the slack. I'm happy with that. Of course I would be happier with finding a block, but hey, can't have everything I guess .Sam

Topic: Antminer S3 missing Chain
### Original post:
I had 2 chains showing before, but one of them had only xxxx for the ASIC status. I went ahead and rebooted the machine to see if it would resolve any issues. Initially, I had overclocked to 250M. I think that may have had an adverse affect. My PSU is 850W, so it should be plenty. Anything I can do to get that other chain back? Right now, I'm mining at HALF the rate I should be.Any thoughts or help?Thanks

Resetting your machine, might will be your solution, since the antminer s3 have a resetting button. but am not sure if that button can bring back your clock setting to default. good luck

### Reply 1:
Download the latest cgminer, your cgminer is very old.You need to use powered usb hub(a good one) since it's draw more power. Of course even if you can draw 336MH, you won't get any share with today difficulty.

### Reply 2:
Version 3.2.1 is actually new enough to run the block erupter. The problem zich has is that he probably has not installed the drivers for his miner to work:<link> this, your computer cannot 'talk' to your miner properly.

### Reply 3:
There's not much point advising him how to use an old version which uses different drivers to the current version and is riddled with bugs long since fixed in the newer versions.

### Reply 4:
I wasn't advising him to use the old version. I was saying that his old version is likely not the problem--it is his lack of drivers which is the problem.I am certain that all versions of cgminer require the silabs driver for the erupter to function--I was using a new version of bfgminer with my block erupter back in the day and I required the driver before it would work.In short, him upgrading cgminer will not address the root cause of his issue. It may be more stable/have less bugs (and be a good idea), but he still requires the same driver.

### Reply 5:
AFAIK bfgminer uses a different driver. Need to use zadig for cgminer to change to WinUSB.

### Reply 6:
Give the new drivers ago as others have suggested, if that does not work let us now. It is a good idea however to update your cgminer.

Topic: Antminer S9 running 2/3
### Original post:
Hi,This is a brand new Antiminer S9 (my first attempt at mining). Can someone help me figure out why it is only running 2/3?<link>

### Reply 1:
Chain 6 is missing chips, see how it has less o's than the others? Each o is a chip that is reporting OK, they are all linked in a chain. For some reason, a chip is bad in your chain 6 and preventing the others below it from working.You could try powering down and switching around the ribbon cables, but this seems like a hardware defect that you need to report to bitmain. Sorry.

### Reply 2:
Thank you. I have already contacted Bitmain (no reply). I was hoping there was something I was overlooking.

### Reply 3:
I say limp along at 11GH and get a few hundred bucks while you wait for bitmain. Send them the screenshot and kernel log, and ask if you can open the front fan and cover and send them back only the bad board. This will break the front warranty sticker, so you must get their permission. But at least you could keep mining at 9-ish GH while you wait for the board to be returned and replaced. The ant won't care if it comes up with only two boards, it will still mine them. But of course, power down before disconnecting anything or opening 'er up.Slushpool - nice!

### Reply 4:
I was hoping that could be worked out. The FAQ says the whole S9 needs to be returned, but it doesn't make sense to do so (to me).Running on the 2 boards, I'm getting 9.2GHI'm jumping in with both feet. I have another S9 coming Dec 27-Jan2, Three L3+ this week, and I'm waiting on half the parts to build three ( 8 ) GTX 1070 rigs.Thanks again for the advice.

Topic: single BFL chip USB Miner idea
### Original post:
Doesn't a single BFL chip still draw more power than two USB ports combined (bus powered)? I think a Jalapeno with 2 chips draws like 30w and 2 USB ports is only 5w of power.

### Reply 1:
Each BFL chip draws about 14watts in the Jalapeno, as several people have measured.So you would need 6 USB ports to run one chip.

### Reply 2:
OK, so it's a dumb idea... nevermind.what about other interfaces, do any deliver required power for a single chip? POE? firewire maybe? I hate external power supplies...

### Reply 3:
dumb idea from a dumb weak as person

### Reply 4:
Not at all a dumb idea. The jalapeos are still using first gen chips, 2 of them and a PCB build for originally up to 8 chips.According to the power spec for the new chips is a power consumption of 3.2 w per GH. This may not be 'USB only' territory but I think a small 1-chip design could still be an interesting proposition for 4 gh/s single chip miners.

Topic: [Review/My Experience]With Bitmain's Second Hand (Used) Antminer S5 Batch 7
### Original post:
Is that a bad thing? You can work that out by asking the following questions:1) When was the last time you heard of an S5 damaged in transit?2) When was the last time you heard of a Tube / Prisma damaged in transit? [A miner that used copious packaging].3) Do you like paying to ship unneeded packaging materials around the world?4) Do you want all the baby penguins to die?

### Reply 1:
Yeah I think the s5 is normally shipped only with 2 white foam pieces.. well also with the bubble wrap bag but with these second hand units i can see why they dont include the bubble wrap.. probably just packaging them up on the fly really quick

### Reply 2:
That's up to the next buyer to decide. For me, personally the different units i have came in smaller/tigher boxes with the unit in an anti-static bag. Overall there's less packaging material. The sides are have a small layer of foam which serve arguable purpose beside balancing the pressure if the unit get thrown or dropped. Doesn't sound particularly overkill to me and it is better packaging and less material weight, while the extremities get the same absorption rate.Is that a bad thing? Probably not. Was the packaging i received very barebone? Yes. Would i have preferred a tighter and better packaging? Yes.Mhm. That is how it went. I do hope we get those coupons toward some other product down the road. It would make me fully satisfied, since ultimately i did pay full price for a slightly used unit, but used nontheless.

### Reply 3:
I really care about baby penguins and polar bears.Bitmain is a good company.About the used miners, every miner by every manufacturer are in use till they are delivered to the last user.30 day warranty is actually working and I feel comfortable to buy products from Bitmain.

### Reply 4:
Its not too bad its been running pretty well now. I did some longer tests pushing real OC on the machine till the machine no longer operate properly;

### Reply 5:
Of the 5 I've gotten, that's how 4 of them showed up. One had peanuts and some antistatic foam and was in a plastic bag, but that one I bought via Amazon used not from Bitmain.The ""30 days starts when the units are shipped"" part is actually illegal under US law - US code specifies that warrenttees start when the buyer recieves the item (I've BEEN to court once over that and WON, it's in the US Code somewhere) but for practical purposes it's not a significant issue given that Bitmain seems to get stuff out promptly once they claim it's shipped - 2 to 3 day difference that most folks would never notice.Just be sure if you DO have a warenttee claim that you get it filed promptly - once the claim is FILED there in no specific time limit on resolution.I suspect the coupons aren't going to be particularly large amount. I'd bet on $50 or less - which is still better than nothing when they FINALLY start selling S7s.

### Reply 6:
I won't spit on 50~$ and worse case scenario i can probably sell them to an user if i can't afford the next gen unit. Regardless. I look forward to it.I'm thinking of opening a ticket with Bitmain about the instability of board one. Overall its not a big hash loss but if its precursor to more severe issue, then that would really bother me ^_^"".If its a stable issue that wont degrade, i don't mind too much. Its a big hash rate loss when it happen, but in the last 3 days it only happened once. It would definitively be a loss to ship it back or something no matter what.Other than that, since my later tests that i didn't report, 393.75 is the best Freq. You can get 5 more GH~ at 400 but you start getting over <0.0001% errors and ultimately you get like 5 gh for 9watt~ of power.

### Reply 7:
So two days ago, the Used Antminer S5 Batch 7 from Bitmain finally arrived. Me and several user were previously discussing the condition and value of buying used hardware for the full price. So this is for the few who asked question such as ""Second Hand S5, Is it worth?"" This will be a pseudo review on specifically the Used batch 7 Antminer S5 bought directly from Bitmain;So the packaged arrived in the usual box it always does. I quickly opened it and found some very minimal packaging. No need to include a picture, it was simply 2 white foam square holding the extremities, with no other kind of padding or packaging whatsoever.The unit was fairly dusty and there was clumps of dust in the heatsink. Hmm well, a bit of pressured air and as new. Or not quite, but i guess its not that bad.2 Minutes later i finished placing it, plugging it and logging into the interface and replacing the Bitmain's worker info with Kanopool. Then flashed to Bitmain's latest firmware.My first impression was Great, the open wrt Luci is very responsive (My S1 are hella slow).I then first tested a few things, the 2 most important point i must bring;-Fan control works, you set a %, no value seem to default to 8<<rest of thread truncated>

Greetings.I'm getting for my 2 USB Gizmos, 336.4 to 336.8 MHash/s, also with active cooling, 1% Hardware Errors. The ASIC chip needs a heatsink and the best I saw (and going to buy from Taiwan in a few days) is the smaller of a 3 heatsink kit to the Raspberry Pi, intended for the voltage regulator of the RPI: <link> If anyone knows a better one, please post here.

### Reply 3:
I believe the heatsink that's on it is glued to it so be careful you don't wreck the chip removing the old one

### Reply 4:
If you are talking about the USB block eruptor, the heatsink is on the backside and it falls off when unscrewed.The thermal pad is not sticky.

### Reply 5:
With a fan on mine, they are averaging ~354MH/s each. It does fluctuate quite a bit, but that is the average.

### Reply 6:
How are you getting 354? Any modifications?Also is it better to take of that heatsink? I Have two of them and for now they are with heatsink on with 120mm fan blowing on them, all i can say that they dont get so hot like without fan, exact temps cant tell, but without fan it was 66 C, now its a lot cooler, but i still get ~ 1.9% HW.

### Reply 7:
I dont think active cooling is neccessary. I got three Erupters and I found out that a passive chipset-cooler attached to the initial cooler along with this thermal-pad does a great job. Got a picture from my setup here:Soon each Erupter will get bis own chipset cooler.

### Reply 8:
The idea is to keep the original gracious heatsink with the BTC logo at the bottom side and glue the aluminium heatsink directly on the ASIC ""BE100"" chip with the included 3M Self Adhesive Thermal Layer, at the upper side.

### Reply 9:
My BTCGuild estimated speed is 1,760.94 MH/s for 5 units, which works out to ~352MH/s each. I've also got a fan on mine.

Topic: Looking for S19 Test Fixtures
### Original post:
I previously owned a test jig for the S9 and it worked for the Antminer S9 and some 17 series hash boards. But recently it has rested. I want to buy a new jig and I want to be able to use it on the S19. No suitable ones have been found so far. I was wondering what do you use to test 19 series hash board?

### Reply 1:
I already give you a link from your previous threads you should also notice the test fixture from ZeusBTC but if you don't know yet then check this Antminer universal chip fixture test fixture.This support almost all Antminer units to test hashboard. And if you still asking for something related to repairing all you need is already on ZeusBTC so learn how to use the search button from their website.

### Reply 2:
Yes buy the fixture from Zeus just dont buy the touchscreen model, its a hot mess. You can also fix Your test fixture with one of Zeuss generic S11/15/17 Zynq boards.

### Reply 3:
Thanks for the reply. I did notice this test fixture from ZEUS before, but I only saw its introduction picture was no marked S19, so it was ignored at the time.Entering from this link, I see that S19 is mentioned in the introduction. Thanks for the reminder.

### Reply 4:
Does touch screen model mean ""2022 new version Antminer test fixture with touch screen""? Why is it mess? I'm thinking of buying the generic or this new version, can you speak more clear? I want to know. thanks.

### Reply 5:
My first one broke on the first day and the screen never scrolls to the last few lines, you constantly have to be touching it to see the final output. I fixed mine with a generic S17 board from them. The convenience of portability is negated by the quirks. Its just a mess but it is completely functional. The one pro I will add about this machine is it has a dedicated board inside that takes ATX power and runs pt2 test fans.

### Reply 6:
Thanks for your reply. This helped me, I think I'll buy a generic test fixture to use first and keep watching this.

### Original post:
I have a question about one (1.0) share mined with clevermining.com bitcoin pool. Several million hashes were calculated at difficulty 1,024. How much is that worth in terms of the bitcoin pool? And when does payout occur? Is it weekly or minimum threshold. Also, they are giving me an error indication user not found and I was mining to my own bitcoin wallet address. Anyone else use this mining pool? I need some advice.

Topic: I just realized why I need to start mining, so a question for miners
### Original post:
The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes.The importance of the above quote struck me last night. So I want to throw in my .02 btc of being an honest node and add some hashing power. I'm not worried about spending a few more dollars on electricity than I make in bitcoins because Bitcoin has already treated me so well.I mined on my laptop back in the day but stopped when it went to GPUs. Now, looking at mining has the same effect on me as the first time I encountered Bitcoin itself. It's confusing for us non-miners. So perhaps an expert or two could help clear up the confusion.My question: What's the lowest impact, cheapest method of adding 1-2 gigahashes/s to the network? As said, this is just to be an honest node as I'm not worried about profit from mining.Thanks!

### Reply 1:
The ""being an honest node"" argument with just 1-2GH/s is moot, because with such a low hashrate you're probably going to mine on a pool anyways. In that case it's not you, but the pool-operator who has to be honest (and you don't really have any control about that).But to answer your question: the cheapest way in terms of initial investment is probably to grab some used ATI GPUs on ebay, although the energy-cost is quite high for the long term. Another way would be to grab some used FPGA boards, higher initial investment, lower energy-costs. Or just wait a few more months and hope for ASICs to be <truncated> that's about all methods around for everybody.

### Reply 2:
So it would serve my interests to do my research first into who's running the pool. And that's what I wanted to know. Thanks for the quick answers.

### Reply 3:
Good for you for realizing the importance of why Bitcoin is so important. Impartiality.So, now, with the right philosophic point of view, go get yourself some ASIC's.

### Reply 4:
Where can we get some? Butterfly labs seems to be DOA and Avalon is sold out.

### Reply 5:
Yeah this is what I'm waiting for. It's OK if I miss the gold rush but will definitely want something simple hashing in the background at low cost once the technology matures a bit. I'd bet plenty others are in the same boat.

### Reply 6:
I'd want a simple small device that I can plug into my computer's USB port and starting bitcoin mining at 10 GH/s or 20 GH/s. When there are about a few hundred of us little folks doing that, we'd help secure the network. Fees can also be lowered.

### Reply 7:
Use P2Pool, and then you're an honest to god honest node.Or really, if your motivation is primarily to secure Bitcoin feel free to solo mine. Your expected return is as good or better, and if you're not in it for the income the fact that its a bit of a lottery shouldn't turn you off.

### Reply 1:
We're designing X-3 to be rackable so we can easily fit it into the data centers but you can certainly use it in your own home.Thank you for the very good question and we're sorry to have created this confusion. We will correct our description soon.

Chips and systems out at end of Feb 2014 - that means tape out sometime in December 2013, which means you've only just, or have not yet started physical design. Without being well into the physical design stage how do you know what your power or performance numbers are going to be with any confidence?

### Reply 3:
We've started the design in June. The only difference between us and our competitors is that we do not give unrealistic time frames which we know we cannot meet. We are confident that we will deliver sooner but we do not make promises that we might not be able to fulfill.

### Reply 4:
I love the prices but 64gh/s (the only one I have bitcoins for) isn't going to make any ROI in feb 2014.

We do not think this is correct. We already replied to this here.

### Reply 6:
I do hope you're right.

### Reply 7:
I am interested,Any guarantee to be delivered during Feb-14?TMC

### Reply 8:
If you are guaranteeing prices then what's the point of preorders? Basically the people preordering now are giving you a free loan because come february everyone gets the same price anyways. The only benefit of preordering now is if the buyer thinks that you won't have to lower prices and the current price will end up being less then market prices for similar devices at the time of shipping.

### Reply 9:
Its not shocking their ""artist impression"" would use some 3rd party case.While I have no experience with them myself, if you look around you will see that Black Arrow is a real company with a sterling reputation for bringing to market FPGA based miners. I dont see any reason to assume this would be a scam.

### Reply 10:
hican you give more details about your fab ?type of asic etc?

### Reply 11:
After a whole year of this ASIC preordering phenomenon/fiasco somehow you've managed to miss the point, lol.Preordering gives these small companies the needed capital to develop ASIC devices. In return, the ""investor"" is rewarded with a place in line when the device finally ships.Right or wrong, it's pretty much the only game in town. If you are waiting for the time when things ship the same day that you place your order, you may be waiting a very long time... unless you're content with ASICMiner Blades and USB Erupters.

### Reply 12:
Another pre-order in stock product ?No thanks

### Reply 13:
Let's see.X-1:$239 / 64 GH/s = 3.73Not $1.99 per GH/s.X-3:$3999 / 1344 GH/s = 2.97 (1344 is from the specification; X-3 should have 21 ASICs 64 GH/s each)Still not $1.99.Chips:$169 / 64 GH/s = 2.64But there is a discount:$2.97 - 30% = 2.079 (2.0828 exactly, but quite close)$.64 - 30% = 1.85However counting the discount is not fair. One would say BFL Single SC 60 GH/s was $699 because of FPGA upgrade.Where Black Arrow took the $1.99/GH/s from?

### Reply 14:
After a whole year of this ASIC preordering phenomenon/fiasco somehow it's starting to feel like the companies will promise you anything and everything just to get your money. Even if it makes no sense. What's the point of them getting capital now if they guarantee to drop the prices to whatever the market price will be in the future and have to return most of that capital? I don't mind gambling but when the gamble is just some vague guarantee promise that isn't rooted in reality that's just one more hurdle to overcome besides the fact of sending non refundable to btc to some outfit in china and hoping for the best on a proposition that's many months away.

### Reply 15:
Customers who pre-order and pay now have 25% discount. Our promise is that we will ensure that customers who preorder now will always get a better deal than customers who order later.At the same time we promise that our prices will be below market price at the time we ship. This means that customers that preorder now will have considerable lower market prices by the time that we ship which puts them in advantage towards anybody else.Unless Bitcoin mining stops because it becomes unprofitable for everybody else in February, our customers WILL make profit.

Orders of over 10000 pcs of Minion ASIC are $127.36/pcs$127.36 / 64 = $1.99

Everybody until now sold you hardware that they knew that you're going to loose money because 1 month later they announced something faster at a better price.We are guaranteeing that this won't happen with us: If we drop the price you'll get even faster hardware, keeping you in front of everybody else.

### Reply 8:
Just so you know, USB works on 5v, not 12v. If your USB hub's power brick is rated for 12 volts, it is because your USB hub has internal power circuitry that brings the 12v down to 5v. If you connect a 12v power source to a hub that does not have this circuitry, you will fry everything, including the USB port on your motherboard since the power 12v power will backlash into the 5v and ruin everything.

No fix yet, at least for me.

Does 11.7 preview still hangs up on a 6950 if you launch a video while mining?

### Reply 7:
yes and no i forgot to turn off my miner the other day and went to watch a movie and my pc dint lock up then i tried it 5 more times and it locked up every time so mabay we are moving in the right direction or it was just a fluke idk. but in the mean time turn of gpu gpu acceleration it fixes it

### Reply 8:
Does the 69xx mem downclock work properly yet? (I mean downclocking more than 100 MHz below core) Anyone that's tried it, I'd love to know - need to cool those 6990s!

### Reply 9:
11.7 Early + SDK 2.5 = ~755 MH/s compared to ~740 with 11.6 + SDK 2.4... (2x 6970s @ 880/170 [mem downclocked with MSI Afterburner after disabling EULA] ...also disabled ULPS)

### Reply 10:
Mine seem to downclock well using Sapphire Trixx.Going from 11.6 to 11.7 gave my 6990 a boost from ~360 to ~374. Nice.No change on 5870s.

### Reply 11:
So, looks like everyone's reporting a small bump on the 6 series cards, but nothing on the 5 series cards?

### Reply 12:
Under 11.5 I've thought I've downclocked mem before, but I noticed that temps were increasing instead of decreasing. When I used some cli tools I found that the mem clock reset to max if I set to more than about 100MHz less than core. Have you noticed a temperature reduction after downclocking mem? What did you downclock them to? This could be awesome - no more fans as loud as hairdryers for my SO to complain about!

### Reply 13:
I just killed my PC with a 6450 upgrading to 11.7. Went to safe mode and changed driver back to 11.6 and now can't even get into Windows. Safe mode hangs on storport.sys (how is this even related??) and Startup Repair from the OS drive hangs on a blank screen while Startup Repair from Windows 7 DVD hangs on Starting Windows with no logo.And, starting Windows 7 setup from DVD also hangs...hardware failure?

### Reply 14:
what happens if you remove the card then boot up?

### Reply 15:
Same. Actually, I just got it to boot. Weirdly in my bios the CPU was undervolted by 0.3v. But the PC has been working fine for 2+ years (6450 is a recent addition). I had pulled out the 6450 and the eSATA pci-e card because of the hang on storport.sys but still could not get past the Windows boot up logo. The integrated graphics was also ATI/AMD so it would loud the same driver - I thought I was screwed. As a last resort I decided to reset the bios (this MB has always been finicky) and noticed the 0.3v undervolt! I wonder if this was usable before (can't remember) and just now at this point in time stopped working or somehow the bios got corrupted (seems so unlikely?).I'm reinstalling 11.7 now to see if the CPU voltage setting was the culprit.Anddd...the PC froze during setup.Reinstalled 11.7 again without display driver and got BSOD..and here's the kicker, my CPU is once again undervolted 0.3v in bios. So now I have some software that can change my bios settings O.O

### Reply 16:
wtf? thats not posible, only with MB that has UEFI...

### Reply 17:
I don't have UEFI. I know it's possible to make real time changes to certain chipset flags but none that persist in the BIOS EEPROM. The undervolting may just be a quirk of the MB from all the hanging and BSODing...it's a weird MB. The system has otherwise been stable since I've put it together.I have tried installing 1. complete 11.7 package, 2. 11.7 without display driver, 3. 11.7 with just display driver, app sdk, and VISION engine. All 3 has same problem - I'm suspecting the VISION engine setup now so going to try it without that.Update: Confirmed the instability is from the VISION Engine. Maybe it doesn't have the correct clock profile for my 6450 and thus runs it at unstable settings. Don't have an explanation for the BIOS undervolting except that the MB is quirky.

What you should try is to set a lower maximum power target. Fir example 1300 Watts maximum. The issue is that Brains OS + does often put to much watts from the beginning. If you get good results with 1300 watts you can try to set higher wattages.If that does not work post again the error codes.

I resoldered the elbow joints on the original connectors, it immediately shot up to 16TH.Is it possible oxidisation of the metal causes the connectors to not transmit current correctly to power the miner?

### Reply 8:
Yes that is totally possible! You can measure if the voltage is correct/if the is a current. If everything works now then I would just leave it however. So this means that your broken control board is now working again fine?

How much current does your power adapter deliver? The USB eruptors require 500mA each. The DUB-H7 can deliver 3A, which is 5 eruptors and 1 fan, or 6 eruptors.

I'm interested because I'm moving into a data center 2h away and I don't want these supplies to crap out as soon as I get halfway home, lol.If you have a voltmeter, I would check the voltage at the power supply's screw terminals as the miner ramps up. Use this miner that limps along, not the other miners that just hammer the supply and stop mining.There is a blue adjustment pot in mine, but messing with it could be dangerous if you don't have a voltmeter to make sure you are not exceeding the s9 spec.

Am I missing something, or is this really just a power button for an ATX Power supply and a Raspberry Pi? How much does it cost, and can you really justify it over something like this?<link> just did a random check, and it seems a bare Arduino board with no accessories runs $30. Add another $10 or so for the other components, and you effectively have a $40 power switch for your $50 Pi. I can see some value if you're making a sealed, plug-and-play miner that you will hand off to someone else (or sell on eBay at an insane markup), but I think for most folks, the breakout board above (or heck, a bent paperclip!) would be more cost effective.

### Reply 19:
You aren't missing anything except the fact that it also talks to your Pi and halts it when you want to power off. I'm not even that interested in selling anything. I started a Tindie campaign just to gauge interest, if people like the design and want to source their own they are free to do so by visiting <link> a cheaper board suits you better than by all means use it, I thought there was value in the idea so I produced and shared it.

Very nice product! One thing the Youtube video didn't mention: Can it support <truncated> I'd like it to automatically power up if it freezes and I power-cycle the PSU. Also, are you selling for BTC?

### Reply 21:
Like I said, it has merit in specific use cases, but in general, it may not be cost-effective. If you can add some functionality to it beyond just a power button, it would be more viable. A couple of ideas come to mind. First, software integration with the Pi so that you could control multiple individual miners and power-cycle a stuck one, or turn on additional miners at set times, when power may be cheaper. Also, Crazyates mentioned auto-power-on; that got me thinking that it would be nice to automatically power on the system as soon as the power supply is plugged in, so that if power goes out in your area, you wouldn't have to do anything to start up your miners after power is restored.Side note, I went looking for a cheaper alternative to that breakout board ($9 each, plus about $10 to ship), and I found this item on eBay. Functional, but certainly not elegant. The guy sells them for $5.50 each, or five for $19, with free shipping in the US.

Easy, you can mine or send btc to cex.io to purchase their gh/s that in turns mines for you, cloud mining.Also you can sell the gh/s you buy from them for btc as well, its a commodity market.Icon

Im looking on their site and I dont understand this part (tell me where I am going wrong)An example realtime price is .082 BTC for each GHS. Lets say I want to go big and get 1TH/s which is 82BTC. At this point is where I get lost...How long will they hash at 1TH/s for me? Until infinity? The reason I ask is that at a rate of 700USD/BTC it will take over a year to become profitable according to <link> conclusion is the people willing to go this route are gambling on BTC going even higher, or still being able to sell your hashing power in the future? Or was your cost for each GH/s much lower and you happened to get in early?

### Reply 19:
they will hash forever and ever (or until some scam / hack / natural death / it ends). its not really much of a gamble, just a flat out loss versus mining yourself unless you factor in risks like your hardware breaking, house burning down, etc.There was never a point where they were willingly offering GH/s at a ""good deal"" price, one of the larger deals that is pure profit is obtaining the GH/s via referrals. The fact that they're able to monetize this points directly to botnet and/or they are clearly making a good profit on the upsell.In short, they're buying the same equipment you could buy (maybe at a bulk discount, maybe not) and selling it to you and making a profit on the service. As the generation % of 1gh/s changes, the value of it should go down but... randomly hasn't, etc.for example i will sell you a % of my GH/s for 1% more than the coins it generates are worth to be assessed and paid daily. Deal?

Um, hate to tell you this but the S3 (and s1, s2, s4, s5, s7, s9, T9, R4) ONLY mine Bitcoin or one of the few other SHA256D algo coins. Since the algo is hardwired into the chips that is all they can mine. Period. End of story.The coins you mentioned are altcoins and are mined using GPU-based rigs. Info for them is found in the altcoin hardware section.""Came without wires""? Such as what? All they need is a PSU and network connection. If you are talking about the little ribbon cables that run between the RasPi and hash boards - you are screwed unless someone has a few gathering dust in a drawer somewhere....

### Reply 2:
I'm not sure how much revenue you are hoping to generate, but i reckon with all 4 machines you would be generating around $1 or $2 per day. You might struggle on some pools that do not pay out ""dust"" (ie very small and invaluable) rewards on a regular basis. i understand some pools pay these out on an annual basis so it saves transaction fee's etc. There are however upgrade kits you can buy that greatly increases the has rate of the S3's - search the forum and you will find them (unsure exactly where the post is). This will cost more money to do so, but i would certainly recommend looking into it at lease. PS - not sure on your set up, but 4 antminers will generate a lot of heat and noise

### Reply 3:
The only ones for the S3 were either the ones Bitmain sold to convert an S1 to an S3 which has long been sold out and Sidehacks planned blades which arent out yet and utilize bitfury chips. Search sidehack and youll find it in his post history or recently made threads.

### Reply 4:
Or the apparently very difficult to acquire Hotmine stuff, that turns a S1 chassis into about a 900W miner.

Proposed question:I pre-ordered multiple FPGA Single, and I received them all.I pre-ordered multiple ASIC SCs, and I've received most of them. The rest were ordered later, and they haven't gotten to them yet.I will admit that I was contemplating ordering from KNC or BitFury, but now I'll have to reevaluate that position.Out of all the hardware being offered, this new Monarch's claimed specs seem to be the most profitable, and I don't imagine any new hardware coming along and changing that. (KNC is also 28nm, but it's not a full-custom chip. BitFury is a fully-custom chip, but it's only 45nm, not 28nm. Both are just starting to roll out, and neither has any units in customer's hands. Avalon or ASICMiner could die-shrink, but I don't think that will help. They'd have to redo everything to accommodate a larger, <truncated> design.)So they have a spotty track record, but they've always delivered. They seem to have the best product for sale (or pre-order, depending on how you look at it). Why shouldn't I buy one? Or 10?

### Reply 19:
Forget about all the tech mumbo jumbo it all boils down to a very simple statement. By now most ASIC manufactures can self fund since they collected plenty of money over and above their costs on these 1st batches. Also they have plenty of information regarding hash rates, possible sales price points, wholesaler demands, consumer demands and prices they are willing to pay in relation to all the other factors, etc... So the only reason to do pre-orders now is because they think what they are getting now will be a lot more then what they possible can get if they simply built it and sold it as it is coming in. And that's the nice business version. The nasty version is we collect pre-order money build it and if it is worth more then what we collected we will sell a bunch out the back door or give out to friends and relatives first before starting to ship. I would love to hear a different argument.

Topic: Decentralisation of the Bitcoin mining pools

Hi,Looking at the hashrate distribution I notice the top 2 pools control more than 50% of the network. Does this not concern anyone that Bitcoin has less than 20k nodes and a hashrate hyper concentraded -- considering the narrative has always been censorship money. It is unlikely but Foundry the biggest mining pool with close to 30% of the network hashrate is based in the US -- there is a scenario in which the US could ban bitcoin, its usage or simply mining. What would happen in that case ?Does the concentration between AntPool and Foundry scare anyone? > Hashrates will be more and more concentrated over time [as the network grows in size and hardware becomes more expensive] does this not threaten the sovereignty of the network -- going fully against the Satoshi ethos ?How far did Satoshi envision the decentralisation, are there counter mesures at hyper concentration events? What could be done in order to mitigate that?Does it pose an existential threat to the value proposition of bitcoin ?I would like to get different views on that and none with the Stock-to-flow answer.This leads me to my ultimate question: if bitcoin is centralised how good is it ? notably in comparaison to oth<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
A mining pool cannot ban bitcoin mining even if it has more than 51% hashrate. The pool may not take transactions into its own blocks, but then the profit of the miners on this pool will greatly decrease. The miners will go to other pools, and this pool will go bankrupt and lose customers due to the scandal. I don't think that the mining pool will violate the rules of coin mining.

### Reply 2:
To put it simply, either they follow the rules or they fork to a new coin.If they fork to a new coin, then that wont be Bitcoin and the miners will leave.As for transaction bias, well as long as you stay away from braiins pool who is actively promoting transaction bias,for other pools, if the pool itself stops allowing all transactions, then yeah, people will just go to another pool that will give a better return.Complete lack of transaction bias ensures a maximum return on mining, which is bitcoin by design = allow all transactions, highest fees get confirmed fastest.

### Reply 3:
Miners start using other pools.NopeI don't think there is any threat. Miners will keep getting in and exiting the network depending on how affordable and profitable it is to them. The Hardware is only expensive because it brings in good profits. So even the mining hardware manufacturers have that in mind. You can't price hardware at $100,000, yet it can't even make $1,000. Who will buy it?

### Reply 4:
~16.5K reachable nodes[1] and ~75K nodes[2] isn't worrying for me. As for pool hashrate, my only concern is they could perform attack which doesn't attract much attention. For example, exclude certain transaction or fill block with their own ""non important"" transaction[3]. Otherwise, i expect they'll follow consensus protocol since it'll lead to more profit on long term.[1] <link> <link> <link>

### Reply 5:
I'd say way better. If you argue that mining centralization is a big issue then other blockchains have other forms of centralization that might affect the network more than some miners mining in one pool IMO. For example, developers belong to one organization that needs to follow regulations where they live, new miners/node need to be approved by some people before they can start participating in the network, and so on. In my opinion, the chance that your transaction is blocked in such a blockchain is way higher than if you use Bitcoin, even if mining power is concentrated on one or two pools. CMIIW.

### Reply 6:
If you look at the old information on pool hashrates by country, then China was in the lead before the ban on mining in this country. In POV mining, it is impossible to block transactions because miners want to get the maximum profit from their work. And in POS mining, the owners of most coins can always change the consensus rules.

### Reply 7:
it is concerning. many are concerned

### Reply 8:
Who are these many? Pools have come close to if not gone over 50% in the past. And large groups of miners left them and went elsewhere. When pooled mining first became a thing there were only a couple of major pools and everyone else was still solo mining. It's not a real concern for people who understand that everything is always going to be in flux with this. The real major concern, which is still not a real concern, would be who controls the miners that are mining at these pools. If some government wanted to take over Bitcoin mining they could over a period of years acquire well over 50% of the hash rate. But if they took part of the hash rate and pointed it to one pool another part to another pool and so on, nobody would ever know about it until all the sudden they pointed it at their own pool. But due to the power requirements whic<rest of thread truncated>

Topic: S5 Startup/ Unable to access Miner UI via IP
### Original post:
Hi there I have been trying to connect my S5 Ant Miner to my network for the last week and it's just not working. I have done all the research I can and it has got me nowhere. I really need some help. I have a 1200 watt HP power supply with a breakout board adapter with 6 pin connectors. I've contacted the seller because i think they tried to short me do to the fact there are only 2 wires going into the 6 pin connectors instead of 6. The power supply is functioning and receiving power it has a led display that shows what the power output is. It says it's outputting 12.2. The miner powers up but I am unable to access the miner UI through the IP address. I am able to ping the miner and no pings are lost o% loss. There are 4 green lights and 1 red light in the middle, of the bottom antboard. I have pictures of the unit and the setup but am not able to attach them to this message. I'm definitely outside my depth rn and would love some help thanks all! New to the forums. Sorry if the question formatting is incorrect.

### Original post:
I'm a newbie GPU miner. I chose GPUs and still would because I enjoy the flexibility of gliding across the algorithm spectrum over which bitcoin reigns. I held out and mined as long as I could to attain the almighty bitcoin. Finally, I've come to the conclusion that my miners will sit idle until the crypto scene is once again profitable here in the land of $.15 per Kw/hour electricity. It hasn't even been a year since I started which leaves me with severely dashed hopes. But I am still hopeful for crypto to once again make headlines and have GPU prices soaring far past what they should be. I'm proud of my own accomplishments even though I haven't yet been profitable. I built a respectable fleet of miners totalling 15 GPUs across 5 platforms. I gained an appreciation for server managers as they are surely profiting despite recent slow downs. I sorted through code, learned about compilation and dependencies and tweaked/optimized feverishly to attain optimized mining results.I do continue mining on some cards that are more cost effective so I have some meager bitcoin coming my way but not much. I'm eyeing the markets like a hawk and hope to see my GPUs reenter the fray someday.This ha<rest of post truncated>

I don't think you will ever be mining with those GPUs again. I calculated that with the current difficulty, a GPU with an efficiency of 3 MH/J will break even at $0.10/kWh only if BTC is over $64k.

Grab a voltmeter and verify that the outlet has power, the PSUs have power, and that you have tried one from the confirmed working PSU list.<link> it open and carefully, after touching the case to discharge static, make sure that nothing is unplugged.

1) Make sure the PSU will turn on without being plugged into anything with the ""paperclip test"" <link> it does not power on then you have a bad (or 2 bad) PSU and need a replacement, I recommend at least 750 watt preferably 1000W+2) If PSU does power on, then make sure you are connecting the power cables correctly:Note: some of the internal cables and connectors could come loose during shipping. Not likely but possible, they should be checked to make sure a flush and tight connection is made - make sure everything is plugged all the way in.The far left 6-pin port connects via a short cable to the controller board. Don't mess with it. Next to it is the ATX_24p connector. It has 24 pins and it connects to the big 24 pin connector (some PSU have 20 + 4 that need to be pinched together during plug in, this can cause a problem if the 20 pin clicks in but the +4 pin is not completely plugged in). Make sure the PSU 24 pin is plugged in correctly, with the depressable tab on ""top"" facing to the right where it matches up with the tab catcher on ""top"". It should click when it is all the way plugged in. It is a tight fit and hard to get this plug in without hurting your fingers or using needl<rest of post truncated>

Topic: Hardware - It's really hard to buy mining hardware
### Original post:
I am relatively new to bitcoin mining and it's really hard to decide on which hardware to buy and from where. I see all the complaints about buying a pre order, so I will never pay for something that is not already shipping. Then there are those obviously fake websites trying to claim that they have a 15 TeraHash miner and another that advertises that by September they will have a miner running at 6 TeraHashes for only $5,000. And then even if you want to buy a machine that is actually real, would you send your money to China with no recourse if you don't receive your machine. Why do these companies only want to be paid in bitcoins or with a wire transfer, if they are not scams? Now I see a company advertising a 600 GH and a 1 TH PCI card - wouldn't that be great if we could use our computers again to mine for bitcoins, but I'm not going to take a chance and pre-order one of these cards for $3,000.I want to buy something with a credit card or with Paypay. I have purchased my mining hardware from EBay - I have 9 Antminer S1 systems. They may not be the latest and best, but I have received them without being ripped off.I'd like to know what every thinks about all the scams out there <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Just buy coins.

### Reply 2:
I don't mine, but I think a major problem with getting the hardware is how long it takes to get to you after you order it. I have heard that often times by the timeyour equipment reaches you, it is almost outdated and there is new equipment out there. As the difficulty continues to increase, it often times would be better just to buy the BTC from an exchange (if that is your ultimate goal).

### Reply 3:
So if coins are selling for $600, then I could buy 8 for $4,800. What could I hope to make? Where do you think the price is going? Double, Triple or back down to $200. I lost money in the stock market - I don't plan on losing money by buying coins. I don't know why the latest strategy and suggestion is to buy bitcoins? Maybe when you could buy 10,000 for $1 when they first came out as a joke, but not at $600. Sure, it's possible that a coin will be $5,000 a year from now, but I have my doubts.

### Reply 4:
If that is the case then you will lose more if you buy hardware.If you buy x coins now, they will still be x coins in a year.If you buy miners now they will be obsolete within 3 months.EDIT: If you are determined to get miners my advice would be the Antminer S2

### Reply 5:
Reputable place would be Bitmaintech .com or Jonesgear .com if you want to pay in paypal or credit card. Bitmain is only bitcoin or bank wire transfer. 73'sIn Bitcoin We Trust!Edit: Bitmaintech has the miners to my door in 2 1/2 days to Midwest from china.. Jones Gear drop ships from bitmain may take couple extra days..

### Reply 6:
Just to give you an idea an AntMiner S2 (running at 1TH/s) would yield about 0.3 BTC/day ($23/day). Assuming that difficulty doesn't change (IT WILL!) you'd ROI in roughly 100 days. You won't be able to run an S2 profitably (assuming $0.10/kwh) after network rate hits ~800m. If you have cheaper power (unlikely unless you're on a big commercial plan) you might make it a little longer, say 1.5b GH/s.

### Reply 7:
It is easy to buy hardware, it is just hard to have it arrve, arrive on time, arrive on time and work.why not hold on to your coins, past experienc shows it is the best way to make money with bitcoin. not the answer you wanted to hear but its the truth.

### Reply 8:
Mining is a risk just like buying, only difference with buying a bitcoin is that you do not need to see a $12k appreciation to breakeven.

### Reply 9:
I think you mean the Antminer S2 is making 0.03 BTC / day

### Reply 10:
If you're dead set on buying mining equipment that ships in a week and using your credit card, I'd recommend this company:<link> the best prices, but should be on your doorstep in less than a week and you can use either bank wire, BTC, or credit card to pay.Also, if you're just starting out, I'd recommend one of the smaller miners like the Rockminer R-box or Antminer S1 to see if mining is for you.

### Reply 11:
If it's not pre order (you have to know who you pre order from) it is not profitable. It's pure and simple loosing money. So, it is better to buy coins and hold. As simple as that.

### Reply 12:
No more questions, just do it. Bitcoin may be trustless, but you can trust the good honest folks on this forum.Except the ones trying to sell you gambling shit in their sigs, those guys are aholes.

### Reply 13:
Hey, I take offense to that! My sig is purty and shiny.I'm Mister Asshole to you.

### Reply 14:
Well it isn't really that hard to buy hardware, but if you wanna ROI or profit.. that isn't easy. I see mining more of a way to support the network these days. If you wanna profit, then you should buy coins instead and just hold for long.

Topic: SCAM: CoinMiner at bitcoin-miner-pro.com steals wallet
### Original post:
It's come to my attention that a miner called CoinMiner is being distributed at <truncated> is nothing more than my own GUIMiner with a wallet stealing trojan attached. DO NOT DOWNLOAD this miner unless you want to lose all your coins and maybe worse. It will not increase your mining speed or do anything else magical except send your wallet to some scammers.I'm very upset that my free software is being used in this way and have contacted the site owners, but I don't expect that they will be very cooperative. I just wanted to warn people not to use it, and if anyone wants to DDOS their site that would be cool. (Joking)

### Reply 1:
Site's down now.

### Reply 2:
well, I hope you consider changing the license of GUIminer to something that makes it stay free software, but prohibits malicious redistribution of that code. At least you could then file a lawsuit against them, for copyright issues. Also, be sure to get a whois output for their domain and report their doings to the registrar. then do a whois on the ip-address where the site is hosted and write some mail to their hoster.(if domain registrar and hoster are not the same company). These usually react fast to complaints. They react even faster to DMCA complaints(in case you really change your license)

### Reply 3:
Sometimes when visiting it I get an error, other times it goes through. Looks like the server reliability is not great. I'm still able to access the site now.The license is GNU GPL and I believe they are already in violation of it (though I'm no lawyer), at least by not distributing the source code to their modified version. I tried a whois and apparently they're with ezinom.com. I guess that's who I can write mail to?

403 Forbidden error..It seems they already went down.. or away..

### Reply 5:
Got a couple SPAM emails from then as well :/The address was apparently harvested from the Mt. Gox database leak.

### Reply 6:
yep, ezinom.com should be responsible. If they do not react, you can also contact Californian Authorities for (helping) violating the US-CAN-SPAM act(ezinom is, according to their whois record listed as a company in CA). US-Authorities can then seize the domain name.

### Reply 7:
I just filed an abuse report to the abuse contact of solid.nsjet.com (where the emails were coming from, which is the same IP address that is hosting the site), after they basically acknowledged that they are violating CAN-SPAM, claiming that it doesn't apply to them because they are on the Bahamas, and explicitly refusing to exclude me from further mailings.

@TheSevenif a hosting provider does not agree to stick to such things as SPAM ""because they are offshore and dont give a crap about foreign laws and policies"", you can and should always make clear that you will warn others to stay away from them because they condone spam. If they are a serious business they will know what happens to hosters that allow spamming: People will stay off them because they could have a spammer on their node having negative effects on their own website rating.You could also try to go a level up - I had this some time with a US company that simply ignored the spam issue - They were hosted with BurstNet(who are pretty strict and fast when it comes to the do nots) as resellers. So I contacted burst and it took about a day until the whole hosting company went offline. Also I'd consider asking a lawyer(there are lawyers that accept bitcoin) for a new free software license that allows modification but forbids malicious modification. Unfortunately you cannot alter the GPL or most other licenses to adept to your likes, because the weird thing about those licenses is that they are usually under pretty restrictive licenses themselves(i.e. if you alter the GPL you br<rest of post truncated>

Since Avalon is auctioning their new 320-chip models starting at 16btc, (.05btc/chip) the chips alone are maybe worth half that.

Your compensation is you can bid on the units they have been hashing with for the last 6 months

Agreed. Chip buyers should be refunded to equalize this price point at bare minimum. They are literally selling entire pre-built units for HALF the price that chip buyers paid for just the chips to go into a unit.For example, 320 chips at half the price of a unit = 7.5btc which comes out to .0234btc per chip. 10,000 chips * .0234 = BTC234. Thus, it equates that chip purchasers should be refunded at LEAST BTC550 per order. Even at that price point Avalon would cover their costs of the chips and still be making a significant profit margin on the chips.

That's not even mentioning the price break for buying 10k chips. I think a case could be made for a sub .02 value. Still, Yifu needs to make this right, or risk a rep. as bad as Pirateat40 aka Trendon Shavers.

Hey all,This is the Fury Thumb from the original v1.2 group buy, not avalon.The drillbit forum used to have everything I needbut it is offline. Even wayback machine can't find it.I used to run it with cgminer and a shortcut that you used as the target. It contained the path, drillbit options, timing,and more. I pretty much need it in cut and paste format as I neverreally understood it, only that it worked.There were also reset instructions where you crossed a couple of pinsuntil the led flashed differently.Lastly, and not crucial at the moment, there were instructions onoverclocking, but getting it running is whats important now.I'll appreciate the help.

Are you reading the speed at the pool or on the internal web display?

That is your problem. You have a blade down. Turn it off for a few mins and reboot and see if you get that blade back. Check the cables as well. If the power falls off to the slave blade this can happen.

Topic: The Miner Don't Working In  iMac
### Original post:
I just got a new iMac at work (I'm a PC/linux guy, but my boss is a Mac guy). It has a ATI 6970, which is one of the best video cards for bitcoin mining today. So I figure I'll download Diablo miner and set it up to run with default settings. Apparently Open CL doesn't work very well on a Mac, so I was only mining at about 1/4 the rate that the 6970 would get in a PC, but still figured it would be worth it to run it over the weekend.So I come back on Monday, and the computer is froze. I restart, and I'm getting visual artifacts on the screen, and it freezes, usually at the login screen, sometimes it logs in, only to have more video artifacts, and freezes shortly after. I'm pretty sure I fried the video card. I'm assuming that the iMac must have really bad cooling on the video card, and it overheated. Aren't there any safety features to shut down the computer if the hardware is getting dangerously hot?I load in safe mode, and delete everything related to bitcoin or the diablo miner, and call the company's tech guy complaining my New iMac is acting up, acting like I have no idea why it would do that.

### Reply 1:
A 6970 was a pretty good card back in the day, but that day was 2+ years ago. Now it's about on par with a USB Block Erupter which only consumes 2.5 Watts vs 300 to 400 watts your Mac would draw if it even worked, and a Block Erupter isn't worth mining with anymore as it draws too much power. If your doing this to goof around, know you'll never break even.

### Reply 2:
Diablo miner was one of the oldest miner's out there, so it probably didn't. That was why CGMiner was such a big deal, because it used the ADL libraries to monitor temps and would throttle or shut down the GPU when it reached the preset temps. But CGMiner doesn't support GPU's anymore since they aren't a viable mining device any longer.

What you want is parallel mining, it's a long story, the short version of it is ""no"".What you can do instead is download AwesomeMiner, it's free since you have only 1 miner, and then use the change pool command based on time intervals and so you can achieveSon 1 worker : 12AM to 12PMSon 2 worker : 12PM to 12AMYou can do 6 hours each or any other combination, but try to switch pools as less frequently as possible since it results in a loss of some mining rewards.

Hi All,I have bought an S9 for my sons and I to play with (more of a learning/fun activity rather than a get rich quick scheme!)Is there a way to create multiple workers that mine to their own pools from the same s9?For example?Assume the s9 runs at 14th.I want a workers that runs at 4TH for Solo Mining (ckpool)Son 1 wants his own worker that runs at 5TH on a pool of his choiceSon 2 wants his own worker that runs at 5th on a pool of his choice.I know this is counter intuitive based on getwork requests, etc but I dont want to buy 3 x S9's that are good for nothing as it is!RegardsStav

Hi all Miners, I experienced a few miners S9K starting loosing its fan. FAN 1 to be exact.Anyone of u have the same experienced? Is only 7 months old.MM

### Reply 1:
It's a well-known issue on S9k but if it still spinning physically you can try this belowIt's worth to try to fix it by:- Remove the fan and then put or attach it back then test.- Cleaning the fan terminals use Laquer flo thinner to clean them then test it again.- Resolder terminals are also worth trying.If these three methods don't work well replacement is the final solution as suggested above.

### Reply 2:
Yeah 7 months to 2 years they all go.pick up a replacement on ebay or amazon<link> went to ebay and picked first two in the searchyou want 6000 rpm to 7500 rpm 4 pin pwmIf you get lucky maybe 8 bucks a fan I don't want to really search it out tonight. You can do it .I do not know those fan sellersIf you look harder you could save a few bucks.

### Reply 3:
How is that an S9k issue? this is more like every fan on planet earth's issue, running for months with probably little no cleaning is enough to toast any fan, it really has nothing to do with the S9k model itself, S9k is indeed the worst miner as far as the control board and hashboards are concerned, but it's a matter of luck when dealing with fans, I have some fans that spin for nearly two years at 90% without a problem, some die in a few months, you just got to blame your luck and move on, there isn't really any way around to fix those fans given their cheap prices.OP, get yourself a new fan/s as Phill said, and I would advise you to actually get an extra one because pretty soon the other one might stop working too, a spare fan and a spare PSU are really important, this is why owning a single miner is probably a bad idea, because buying a spare fan, PSU and a control board for a single miner is not the best thing to do, but if you have a few of them and keeping a single piece of spare of everything makes a lot of sense.On a side note, I am not sure if this just by chance, but I noticed that setting a fixed fan speed on those fans even at high RPMs of 90%, the fans tend to last lo<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 4:
running a fan at 70 or 75 or 80 or 85 or 90 percent static setting is far better then auto tuning a fan.100% setting is stupid as it burns up and does not cool much better then 90%auto tuning also kills them.I try to set fans to 70 and track temps if needed bump to 75. and up to 90 if needed.Antminer gear can sometimes use a lower fan even a 4000 rpm set to 90% may work depends on what miner you are using.all s9's will run with a 4700 rpm model set to 85% static.now it may be you set a really high freq and are burning up with that fan but the miner will try to run.When it checks the fans for speed to determine you have working fans it looks for the fans to get up to 4000 rpm or higher at 100% .this is a slower lower energy fan<link> gear will run on a low speed setting with this fan. I use it to make one and 2 board space heating s9'sdo not get any fan weaker than this.also have a good understanding OF WHAT YOU ARE DOING IF YOU GO THE LOWER WEAKER FAN ROUTE.ie don't think an s9 will do 3 boards at 15th with these fans.

### Reply 5:
not sure how the speed running on S9 and T9+, but these old model miner fan seems running longer than S9K.BTW, i just changed the fan. Thanks miners.

### Reply 6:
I highly doubt the quality of the fans on the S9 and T9+ are any better than those on the S9k, the latter miner is indeed the worst of all, I have created a whole topic explaining why one shouldn't be purchasing Antminer S9k.I wouldn't be surprised if the way the firmware handles the fans' speed makes them die sooner, I have not experienced that because I set static fan speed on all of them, took me a while to figure out how to do it, but not more than a few days which indeed not enough to toast them.Meanwhile, I suggest you set a fixed fan RPMs just to be on the safe side, you can follow this guide and set the % you desire for the fans, I personally use 90% most of the time, but the % you chose is up to you, if you face any issues in doing so, ask in that thread and I will happy to assist you.

### Reply 7:
If he got a real delta ball bearing fan it is better.also san ace denki ball bearing is very good.some times I got deltas on s9 miners.i once got a case of san ace or sanyo fans they were really good.but a lot of s9 gear has shit generic or counterfeit fans.

### Reply 8:
Everything comes with a price, last I checked delta fans for S9 go for above $20, which is way too much IMO, I bought a bunch of cheap fans from a Chinese supplier I paid like 3$ each, and believe it or not they were pretty good, obviously nothing like those high-end fans you suggested, but the life-span of any given miner is way too short to be worth an expensive fan IMO.The good part, however, is that most Antminer fans have almost the same size and specs, <rest of thread truncated>

asic miner tubes have 'bad' software. you can not use every pool only some work.it is possible that bitminter went back to a different set of instructions. I had a tube a while back it only worked with mmpool.org and ghash.io some pools altered their software to allow tubes to work. slush did. i guess bitminter went from bad to good to bad. kano's pool was bad then good then bad about using the tube. so i guess bitminter did the same thing.

### Reply 1:
When you say ""low electricity"" what do mean?Plug in your information and see for yourself what the costs will be and any potential profits will be with a mining calculator.<link> may want to check out a few different calculators. Some give you more/better information than others. Combined, they will give you the big picture.The speed of your internet connection is inconsequential. Mining is not internet intensive. Just need a stable internet connection.Air conditioning may not be the issue. AC will be fine to cool off the room, but you REALLY need a way to vent the heat outside of the room. That is one of the most important, IMHO.

I have no way of answering that question if you don't say what your electric cost is. That was why I asked. I don't care if you call it ""low"" or ""cheap"". What is the cost?

Topic: [COUPONS AVAIL] AsicMiner USB Block Erupters - BTC Guild Coupons Available
### Original post:
I'm currently offering 6 x .4 erupter coupons... Willing to let all 6 go for .256 erupters for 2.65 shipped directly to you from the guild = approx. .44 a piece As for trust you can check my feedback on bitmit (same username) - Do not want to harm my credit in this community over 2.65...Other members not wanting to use the .4 coupons are free to list and resell them here. As Eleuthria has kindly asked to not overwhem the Guild thread with reselling coupons.

### Reply 1:
Uh ... I'm not sure I understand this offer. The BE's are being sold outright for 0.33BTC each, plus maybe 0.06BTC for shipping in the US. No coupon needed, and near unlimited quantities. Did you perhaps mean a 0.1BTC coupon offer? A link to the other thread you mention would also be helpful.Edit: Did you mean you're selling them at 0.44BTC each, 0.25BTC each, or 0.25BTC total? Sorry, I'm not reading right tonight. If the last one, I'm interested. Let me know and we can work out shipping.

### Reply 2:
Ah, much clearer now, thanks. But I'm afraid I'll have to pass on the offer. Good luck with it!

### Reply 3:
Thanks!

### Reply 4:
Sorry, might be partly my fault as well.. I have 6 coupons for erupters from BTC Guild.. (Not Asicminer coupons) These are from the guild promotion.. .4 per erupter... Price Set by Eleuthria on BTC Guild. Not by AsicMiner..I am aware of the pricing in some of the group buys. I am willing to sell all 6 of my coupons for .25 meaning total price would be 2.65 for 6 erupters.. Approximately .44 a piece.. I am not selling erupters. I am offering up these coupons for someone who wants to order erupters from the guild for a better price than would be without the coupons. (even after the extra .25 is tacked on this deal beats the current BTC Guild price by over .05 per erupter ) After receiving .25 I will place the order and set them to be shipped to your address directly. The purchaser of the coupons will then send the 2.4 payment to the guild confirming the order.

### Original post:
Hi All,This hasn't really been explored in depth from what I can see after spending the last few hours sifting through many posts in various sections of this great forum. Needless to say I spend 99% of my time reading and 1% posting - so I thank everyone in advance for their contribution to what I feel is a much needed topic of discussion.I would like to please get some comments/dialogue on the following queries:1. What is the 'best' wallet to mine directly to? I'm talking about an address that doesn't change that you can point your workers to or get pool payouts sent to **Loaded question with no definitive answer I know but there are so freaking many it's insane to have to choose from all of them there must at least be a top ten list somewhere that has been thoroughly thought out and explored from every angle**. So for a top ten list I'd like to explore hardware based, app based, desktop based, online hot wallets, exchanges, just leaving the coins in the pool itself for a long period of time, others?2. The highest level of security and most stable/long lived wallet to mine to?

### Reply 1:
The wallet you chose isn't related to mining. In other words, the fact that you're mining or not shouldn't affect the wallet you chose.Unless you don't mine with a pool and need to run a full node, which I don't recommend to a beginner.Choosing a wallet is a lot about your needs and how you plan to move your funds after you mine them.It's usually a balance between security and ease of use.

Thank you unholycactus I will check out multibit it's a new one I am not familiar with - I am aware of the others and currently investigating Thank you again for your response I really appreciate your input :-)Have a nice day! Good karma to you!-jd

### Reply 5:
If you have at least 300 GB free in your hard disk I would suggest you to download the Bitcoin core wallet. I say 300 GB so you can be ready even for next year when the size of the blockchain will grow more than it is actually at about 150 GB. It is one of the most secure wallets which is free. It takes time to download and sync but once it is done it is worth every minute you spent syncing it.

### Reply 6:
Done. Revamping my setup to allow for the extra space and the backup of that space. Appreciate the comment re:What will happen to coins in the bitcoin core wallet after August 1st? Your time and help is duly noted and very much appreciated. Good karma to you All the very best and kindest regards,-jd

Coins in the bitcoin core wallet will remains same, only potential change regards value; however, actual coin quantity remains unchanged.

For racks, just use normal wire-frame racks available from Home Depot etc. like these which are 20"" wide Very old pic - those were s1's...

### Reply 5:
Thank you...I will be using the PSUS for Antminers provided by Bitmain. So this should be good for those? I am planning to run 128 of them in total.

### Reply 6:
Thank you. I like the mesh ones but the thing with those is I am not sure how to create a hot and cold isle with that. Since the racks are a little fragile there is no place to put the drywall to contain the heat. Do you make containment aisles in your new ones?P.S. What's that thing from Tripplite?

### Reply 7:
The racks are far from fragile. Big or small they are quite sturdy. As see in the pic each shelf has a lip perfect for attaching things to including drywall if desired.Those were 1kW stand-by UPS's. The old S1's only drew about 450w and at the time power at home in my area blipped off-on at least 1 once a month so it was practical to use them. Now days with miner power needs over 1kw I would not advise using UPS's unless absolutely needed. Just too expensive.

### Reply 8:
okay 128 x 1500 = 192,000 wattsyou can just about do 4 units per pdu.You need bigger pdu's then the ones I gave you.There are some 50 amp pdus aroundmore costly but they should do 9 s-9's<link>

### Reply 9:
Thank you...So if I just use the ones with the 4 it will be much cheaper. I will be able to use 2 of those to plug 8 units for just 80 bucks where as this 50 amp one costs 299 dollars and will house just 9 units...I think that would be okay, right?

Topic: Heat & Where to Stick It...
### Original post:
It's looking like the initial set-up I'll be going for is 2x Avalon 741 & 1x Antminer L3+. It's not a major set-up or anything, but it's going to generate a sufficient amount of heat. To make it worse, I'm located in Louisiana... 100+ F temps in the summer with A LOT of humidity. I'd appreciate your suggestions on how to manage the heat and airflow. I'll be installing a 220V line for whatever space in which the miners end up unless you guys feel that is unnecessary. Noise is a concern (wife and 4 kids), but I'm not opposed to installing sound insulation if necessary. I'm an engineer and am not afraid of doing any of the work myself (except for any electrical). Options: House is large, has AC, and has room to store the miners within a closet or within an enclosure in the utility room. Note: Utility RM shares boundary with garage and is immediately adjacent to breaker panel (opposite side of wall). It also has access to the existing dryer vent, which goes directly outside of the house. Possibly a very bad idea given the high fire-risk of dryer lint.I have an attic with a lot of available space to set up the miners. Note: likely not an option due to how hot the ambient temperature in <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 2:
I was checking through your photos, and was wondering, are your exhaust fans constantly running, or do you have them set on a temperature switch for on/off operation. I'm looking into different designs for next spring and didn't want to forget to ask? At the moment I am looking into the best way to rig my avalon exhaust to my furnace return air intake in the basement. My plan is to widen my return air intake in the basement and mount my miners within a few feet, and restrict the main air intakes on my main level by half or so. I might just have to run a few feet of ducting wide enough to accommodate the airflow to within a foot of the miner exhaust. I figure by running my furnace fan constantly instead of on/off with the thermostat, I can keep a steadier heat in the house and that will be the most efficient use of the miner heat. The 4 miner set up will equal about 20% of my furnace at full capacity, so with steady fan circulation this will greatly offset my power consumption costs, as I'm going to need it anyways.Winter is coming.

It appears they have sent me compensation automatically for my delayed T17+ units, as I received just under 1500 usd of coupons today and they are named 'T17 coupons' - unless it is standard to receive these after every order is shipped?

### Reply 4:
No that was to make up for their screw up.Coupons vary in quality. Some are 10% some are 20 % some are 30 %So if you do an order for 1000 and have a 300 dollar 10% coupon you get to use 100 of the coupon. and the order becomes 900a 1000 order with a 300 dollar 20% coupon you get to use 200 of the coupon and the order becomes 800a 1000 order with a 300 dollar 30% coupon you get to use 300 of the coupon and the order becomes 700So 30% coupons have more value then 10% coupons.Of course if you don't need the coupons they can be given for free to other people or you can try to sell them aftermarket .The sales section for bitmain coupons would be digital goods.<link> is an older offer to buy coupons<link> is an old offer to sell some<link> anyone now waiting on a bitmain order this post may help you get some compensation coupons.

It's a 10% coupon. To be honest that's not particularly good compensation, as it's really only any use if I intend to make another big order (15,000usd upwards).

### Reply 2:
While I expect it's valuable in terms of effort, I don't see why it would be absolutely critical to get everything changed at once on N miners. What happens if you do N/2 in the afternoon, and N/2 the next morning? I can't imagine the pools would care, nor would the S5 miners. If I had N (N>1) miners I would clearly consider spreading their hash rate across multiple pools. And I certainly wouldn't lose any sleep over the fact they might have different settings. They are all running at different speeds anyway, and using different amounts of power at some level.

You could use a configuration management tool like puppet or cfengine.

### Reply 6:
I use MiningRigRentals for managing pools, of all things. You don't have to use their services, but I can simply point all my miners to their proxy servers once when I first set them up, and then in my account I can manage several different pool configs and groupings easily. Plus, if you decide you want to put your miners up for rent it's easy too. For example say i have about 30 miners. I have 6 different groups of them, each one has 5 miners in the group. I have 6 different mining profiles with different pools and priorities, each one assigned to a group. I set a price for renting them, and if price goes above, it switches to renting, otherwise it mines at the pools I've configured. Switching pools is a few clicks in their web interface.I used to do it by custom written Linux scripts, but this method is so much easier. On top of that I use M's MinerMonitor (you can find it under the mining software us forum) to monitor all of them for their performance, temps, etc.

### Reply 7:
That's also a good way I have my antminer pointed to miningrigrentals and switching pools is a few clicks and if u can get on the Web u can change your pools

There are multiple as mentioned. All have their pro's and con's. I would give Minera a shot as it will run on a raspberry pi -<link> using a raspberry pi you will save electricity compared to a full size pc running 24x7.And MiningRigRentals has some intresting options. I personally don't use it but if you had a miner in a data cener you can't change pool easy setting it to MiningRigRentals will allow you to change pools. And the better way is probley setting up a proxy which I think the amazon free EC2 should be able to do fine.

### Reply 9:
As others have mentioned, Minera is pretty great. There is an ARM image so it is easily flashed to an SD card for a Pi. The statistics are detailed as well. It really allows you to see which miners are underperforming and need to be tweaked. And it automatically attempts to recover miners that go down. It's a time saver so you don't have to go rebooting miners all day.

### Reply 10:
Can you control them(network miners - specificly antminer S5's) from minera? or is it just monitoring?

### Reply 11:
I set up Minera yesterday in hoping I could swap pools etc but had no luck myself. It does do monitoring but that's all I see on a local network. I even tried to swap to my reserve pool on the S3 and it would not even do that. I ended up setting up an account at a mining rental place and pointed my miners there in groups of 5. So far it has been great and I have not noticed any decrease in hash rate.

Topic: Can only boot with 2 cards.
### Original post:
Sorry that I'm reposting this from the newbies section, but I think I would get much better help here.First of all here is some information that should help. I am currently running windows 7 premium 64 bit. The motherboard is a MSI 880G-E45, and I have used it to run 3 5830's in the past when running win XP 32 bit. The PCI-e slots are arranged as follows: 16x(runs at 1x because I tried using tape to force it to 1x), 1x (covered by 1st card), 1x(PCIe x1 extender attached to this), 1x(back cut out to allow 2nd card to be inserted onto mobo). The only real difference between this setup and when it was running XP is that when it was running XP the first 3 PCIe slots were all occupied by pciex1 extenders, leaving the 4th slot empty, but now the first, third, and fourth slot are occupied. When I try to boot up with a card attached to the 3rd slot via extender cable, the computer freezes at the windows boot screen, restarts, and then the bios says that a Hyper Transport Sync Flood Error has occurred. I don't know if it makes any difference, but the PCIEx16 slot is a 2.0 slot and I assume the x1 slots are all PCIE 1.0 because they are not listed as 2.0 in GPU-z, like the 16x slot is.What w<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
What PSU do you have? Have you checked the pins on your extender cables and on the mobo connectors?

### Reply 2:
Its an antec earthwatts 750W. It has had no problem powering 3 cards in the past so that is not the problem. I haven't had time to test the extender cable I'm using for the card in the 3rd slot, but I am going to test that now.

### Reply 3:
AH yep it was a faulty PCIe extender. Thanks for that suggestion.

try this thread:<link> <link> <link> any of the dozen Avalon threads here. But...It's probably around 9 BTC (maybe a little less) per day before power costs at this moment.

### Reply 2:
Hi,It's around 8.2648 BTC(as per bitcoinx.com) per day as per the difficulty level 3,651,012.00, when they mine their own. if they use any pooled mining then less minimum 3% fee.it will be changed in next few days. b'coz the difficulty level will be changed to 4,281,991.00(in next 665 blocks solved as per bitcoinwatch.com) then it goes to 7.0469 BTC per day. now the blocks has been solved approximately 8.21 per hour. this will be solved with in next 80 hours(approx). which means approximately happen in 4 days from this time.then the earning will be goes to 7.0469 BTC(as per bitcoinx.com) per day.Hope my answer will compromise <truncated> Sorry for my English.

### Reply 3:
Thanks guys very much. I really didn't know there were other topics out there since they just came out. My bad, sorry about that. I'll take those numbers, pretty good in my book. Are the avalons really hard to setup? Don't they come with software or anything, drivers for Windows or anything like that or they just go through your USB port?

### Reply 4:
Pretty good? That's like saying winning the lottery makes one able to live a comfortable life.Don't forget, the bitcoin proceeds are relative to one thing ... the difficulty at every point in time that it is mining. If total hashing capacity of the network doubles, the number of bitcoins received when mining with any hardware (e.g., Avalon ASIC) will drop in half.

Topic: Multiple cards with PCI-E-x1 - newbie question
### Original post:
Befor I start to destroy my old MOBO I wanted to ask - will 2 cards work on MOBO, which chipset (P31) doesnt support crossfire/SLI. I'm not going to crossfire my radeons, but just wondering, if it will work.PS. Any advices how to safely cut back of slot?

### Reply 1:
Cutting a slot and running a GPU @1x would not be advisable! Now cutting a 4x slot would be a slightly different story. Just get a new MoBo with 2 PCI-e x16 slots.

### Reply 2:
look for cablesaurus in the selling thread. He's got a variety of custom cables to meet your needs.

### Reply 3:
Nonsense, a PCI-E x1 slot will be ample for what us miners require. Cutting the actual mobo might be tricky, but if you're careful it should be fine. I wouldn't recommend cutting the actual mobo, but as it's old and you seem keen I don't see the harm in it.For some advice on how to cut the extender check out this guys blog:<link> isn't needed for mining and is slower in most cases, you'll have to run a miner for each GPU.

### Reply 4:
I know crossfire isnt best way to mine, but my actual question is if mobo can support both cards. @ buying MOBO - additional costs... I'm just trying to use hardware I already have.@ cables - Im from europe - shipping cost and time are unacceptable

### Reply 5:
yes, pci-e x1 is pretty much the same as pci-e x16oh, you can get x1 extenders for less than $5 shipped on ebay. although you'll have to cut it yourself. not hard.

### Reply 6:
two cards don't mean crossfire

### Reply 7:
Semi-relevant thread hijack:What's the voltage that the PCI-E x1 can give? Is it possible to run a dual GPU card through a PCI-E x1 extender, a 5970 for example.

### Reply 8:
+12v i think

### Reply 9:
Better to get a modified extender cable with a molex for dual GPU cards

### Reply 10:
These cards will be powered by separate PCIe power connectors anyway, so it does not make a difference. PCIe itself provides 75 W of power.I have a HD5570 running with one of these 1x extenders, it consumes about 40 W via the PCIe and has been doing fine for a couple of months.

### Reply 11:
Just done moding. And:ITS WORKING, even when second card doesnt have enough space on mobo (bios battery). BTW, can I remove that battery?

### Reply 12:
Yes, but you will need to set your clock every time that you unplug your desktop from the wall. Some bios also require that you ""load defaults"" if the cmos was erased.

### Reply 13:
I have to load default anyway cuz I think battery died few weks ago, just didnt know it there should be something to clost circuit. Thanks for your help.

You need a PC Power Supply to power it, last ones were sent out with Molex connectors on, but previous ones have had cable screws for the black/yellow cables. You need a PC to run cgminer (linux) or hexminer (windows) on, but it's recommended to use the TP-Link TL-3020 router as a 2Watt Linux PC, there is firmware on their web site that installs everything you need.

Hello,we have created the following website Ayho.es to create a bitcoin miners farm 2.8 TH / s with ASIC chips.On the website you can buy shares from this farm. Here you can see the prices <link> Every year or earlier. It will double the power of the farm (no added cost, free), the idea is to reach 28 TH / s. After reaching that power would attempt to invest in the DESIGN and MANUFACTURE own chip to add more speed, thus avoiding the dependence on other companies that take months to send you orders, if at sometime. All this process will be completely free, without any cost to the shareholder and completely transparent.- Income payments will be made when a certain threshold (selected by the shareholder) is exceeded. These earnings will be deducted the cost of electricity and internet, plus a 2% for maintenance costs.- The mining would be operational around late November early December.- He put a phone number once started mining to resolve any questions or problems.

Topic: Temp PCB or Temp Chips? Btc.com Tools vs Awesome Miner
### Original post:
Hi GuysIm looking at a software from mining monitoring, i want something that gives me reports in CSV files so i can compare de temps of my asics from time to time to make a full historic data.BTC.com tools give me that report for free, but they have the temps of the PCB only and not the chips.Awesome Miner have this function too, and they show the Chip temps.The question is, what temperatures really matter and what is the difference? They change in the same way (now on my farm the difference is at 10C between PCB and Chips)?If PCB temps are ok to monitor, i dont have to pay for awesome.

### Reply 1:
Monitoring the pcb temps could work if you keep in mind that the chip temps can get considerably higher.If you write a simple batch / bash script you can check the stats and generate a csv yourself, I have done it with all 6 temps.

### Reply 2:
Do you mind to share that batch?I dont have programmer skills

### Reply 3:
I think it couldn't give you a good temp result or estimation how hot you're every chip is.@OP if you have more than 2 miners I think it is good if you use the awesome miner when you wanted to monitor the temps of every PCB chips it gives you accurate temps.I think there is a free version of awesome miner but limited to 2 miners.

### Reply 4:
Sure thing. If you want the batch version I would split it up into two scripts, one to get the info and one to compile to csv. Make a new folder, where you will put everything into. First put a list called miners.txt that looks something like this:Code:A1 - 192.168.1.3A2 - 192.168.1.7A3 - 192.168.1.5A4 - 192.168.1.6B1 - 192.168.2.3B2 - 192.168.2.4and so on... Location can be anything you want, even just 1 2 3 etc. Just make sure it is like (location) - (IP) on each line, nothing blank or different format.In this folder you also need a powershell script. Make one and call it clearNull.ps1, with this <truncated> "".\_\"" | ForEach { (Get-Content $($_.fullname)) -replace ""`0"", """" | Set-Content $($_.fullname) -NoNewline }Now make a .bat file for multithreading. Make one and call it _T.bat with the below source. You will need ncat on your system or just download ncat.exe from online and drop it in the folder.Code:@echo offecho Antminer S9 Information Gathering Threadecho.setlocal enableextensions <truncated> /f %%a in ('copy /Z ""%~dpf0"" nul') do set ""CR=%%a""for /F ""tokens=*"" %%A in (_%1.tim) do ( for /f ""tokens=1,3"" %%a in (""%%A"") do ( set ""tx=%%a"" <nul set /p ""=Processing miner on %%b ..<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 5:
The problem is probably with netcat like you mentioned. The step 5 issue is just a result of not having any text files in the folder.The version of netcat that you downloaded relies on external library files. I would use one that is statically compiled specifically for Windows. e.g. <link> Sorry for the confusion, I should have linked to this one specifically. If you still have issues with this ncat.exe let me know.Also you should copy and paste what you have in miners.txt so I can see if you are using the proper format.

### Reply 6:
Nice man, but im having some issues to runI download the netcat from this link <link> and put in the same folderThe ""exe"" file on the rar have the name of nc.exe, so I edited the _T from ""netcat"" to ""nc""When i run, on step 3 the CMD opens another window with ""the system cannot find the path especified"", i think theres a problem with netcat (already give permissions on my antivirus).On step 5 im having this <truncated> : Cannot find path 'G:\Mining Control\_\' because it does not exist.At G:\Mining <truncated> char:1+ Get-ChildItem "".\_\"" | ForEach { (Get-Content $($_.fullname)) -replac ...+ <truncated> + CategoryInfo : ObjectNotFound: (G:\Mining Control\_\:String) [Get-ChildItem], <truncated> + <truncated> : <truncated>

### Reply 8:
The miners.txt format is good, you can make the ""location"" any unique text you want by the way.I sat here staring at it for like 10 minutes until I realized it might be because your folder has a space in it. You should try removing the space from the folder. Also in the folder you have you should make another folder called _ (just one underscore) to hold all the text file results. I didn't mention that before because I thought the program made that folder automatically but I guess not.Let me know if it works and if not idk, I will reduce it to a non-multithreaded<rest of thread truncated>

Just run a second CGMiner version 3.8 or above, that should do the trick.

First, please don't write in all caps. That is usually treated as an aggressive intention.On the other hand, ASICs cannot mine scrypt. They are designed for bitcoin, which uses the SHA-256 algorithm, and not the scrypt one.You can only mine SHA-256 coins. You cannot mine scrypt coins.

Topic: Buying Used 5850
### Original post:
Alright, so I was gonna buy a 5830 from NewEgg to replace my 3850 and start mining, but that opportunity is out the door. I have found someone selling a used sapphire 5850 xtreme on CL and he seems like a nice enough guy, but of course I'm wary. After asking if I could see it in action before buying, he has offered to video it running in his case with a fairly intense 3D game on the monitor, and show that to me when I come to pick it up. I realize this is a pretty big risk, but the price is right. Plus, I have no problem banging the shit out of his door if it's defective until we meet an agreement. Any advice?

### Reply 2:
$130 -- He also noted he was a gamer and upgraded to a 6xxx series card.

see it in person first. make sure you bring a friend.

### Reply 4:
Don't bring money, check it out and offer to meet in a public place (not a parking lot), ask if it's ok to write down his name and address as it appears in his drivers license (if he hesitates, offer yours in return).Recently a man was robbed at gunpoint when he met a CL phone seller at a fast food restaurant.

### Reply 5:
I've done CL transactions before, I'm not worried about getting robbed. I'm more worried that he may have OC'd the GPU and damaged it or something like that, and was wondering if the video seemed like good enough proof to you guys.

The Sapphire 5850 Extreme just came out 2 months ago (for $150 MSRP), it should have a solid warranty.He's probably just an average gamer, I'd ask him to run a stress test for a few mins.Edit: maybe a video which shows the serial, and some stress tests would be great.

Topic: Using functions from api.c in cgminer
### Original post:
Hello!I am creating my own application for manage of Antminer S9.I found source with API here: <link> there is file api.c with functions i need and example in api-example.cBut how i can use API from api.c and create my own application for send command?Is it possible to create library from cgminer for using functions in my C++ project? How is possible to use functions from this project?

### Reply 1:
I put an example in C, Java, PHP and there's also an example in Python and Ruby.Look for the word api in the filenames.If that doesn't help, you'll not be able to write anything anyway.It's a simple socket, you just send a command and get a reply then close the socket.The ""library"" is called socket programming.

it is 19 mill today. will be 21 mill in 3 days. I think 10% each 10 day adjustment.

Topic: S7 miner one board hotter than the others, why?
### Original post:
about a month ago I got a used S7 that has run ok for now. However i've had to reboot a couple of times and I suspect it's because it went over 80C and stopped. I check the board temperatures and one is running at 70-71C while the other two boards are running at 62-63C. Could this be an indication the miner needs a dustoff ? I'm running it next to an S5 (about 4 inches apart) so my other thought is that maybe the S5 is generating heat that is conducting to the S7 board closest to it. The S5 boards are running at 56-65C.Thank you for any help you can provide.

### Reply 1:
possibility that S5 is influencing the higher temperature but to rule that out, you can move S7 into another air conditioned room and power it up and check the temperature. If in colder air conditioned room and 1 pcb is showing still hotter temperature, then, time to open the unit and see if cleaning be needed. We have seen many units with temperature problem had everything you can think of collected and saved on the hash PCB and inside the S7 case.dust, human hair, animal hair, hairball, candy wrappers, parts of vermine, insects. So dust off may help if that is the case.If dust off and in the cold room and the temperature will not be resolved, then please check the intake fan, if it is spinning at at least 3600 RPM. if none of those solves the problem... then you probably have some chips or components that are degraded but still function. At this stage, not sure if its cheap enough to repair or seek used S7 and replace the parts or let it goRepair on S7 pcb can cost from $35-$85 range some are less and some are more.

### Reply 2:
I can't move the S7 to another room but I can power down the S5 for a trial period. So I will do that first. As for the fans I just checked and they are running at 4500 rpm or so. I have seen a lot of dust on the fans so I imagine there's dust on the inside. I saw a few videos on how to clean the S7 so I will take that up once the S5 power down test is complete. As for repairs it's too costly for me to send it for repairs. Are all boards on an s7 the same? this way I could just get a new-er board and keep as spare.

### Reply 3:
if you see heavy dust, probably that be the cause.replacement wise, depends on where you are located,may be cheaper to just buy a replacement PCB. or other units. PCB version or model needs to match as there are several versions of S7 exist

### Reply 4:
How do I know which PCB to get?

### Reply 5:
The thermal paste can go bad too,check that last by removing heatsink & cleaning & reapplying with the correct paste,ask around about what paste is recommended

### Reply 6:
There is no thermal paste in S7....

### Reply 7:
If you clean it and it still runs a little hot thats not really a big deal. Unless it is throwing a ton of hardware errors or crashing all the time just let it run a little hotter.

### Reply 8:
Looking at the exhaust end the board on the left will almost always be a fair bit hotter than the other 2. Reason is the air flow in that location. Same applies to the s9 and t9. Just the nature of the design. The only reason for the *almost* is because s9/t9 miners with auto-tune can change it if Vcore is higher/lower per-board.

### Reply 9:
Coulda sworn I saw folks cleanin & reapplying paste on S7 awhile back....my bad

### Reply 10:
There is thermal adhesive in S5+, S7, S7-LN, S9, R4, T9, L3 and L3+ heatsinks.

### Reply 11:
So today I got an alert that my S7 was offline, again! I couldn't go to turn it back on for almost 8 hours. Thanks to you and some you tube videos I had a pretty good idea that I had to clean it and how. I finally went to my S7 and took it apart. There was caked dust along with some real life bugs that caused obstruction on the front end of the boards. One more than the others. I spent a whole bottle of compressed air cleaning it up inside out and took out each board and blew all the dust out. Eventually I figured I got all the dust out that I could. I put it back together and turned it on. It wouldn't turn on at first but I figured out I hadn't plugged in the front fan first. Plugged it in and got it working fine. Temps are now in the 50-60 range versus the 60-75 range that was before. I hope it can now work for months without stopping. Thank you all for your help.

Topic: Would a C1 survive without water cooling in a -1C cooled room ?
### Original post:
hello, would a C1 survive for 5 days in a room with -1C ? without Water cooling and only 4 Fans ?

### Reply 1:
Real tricky question...You should specify, either celcius or farenheit, this is a 32 degree difference.Think that -1 farenheit is about -30 celcius.In both cases, it's not a good idea for a C1.If the room could have a steady -1 (Celcius) then you would only need a small fan, considering -1 <truncated> the miner is also alone, -1 celcius is not that cold.I have an S4 in a open window bathroom in the middle of the winter the S4 got down to 33 celcius last night...If it's -1 Farenheit then the miner is more at risk of actually freezing and lot worst <truncated> naturally give off heat, the absence of cooling system in such cold weather will create a lot of condensation.Cold environment turns to ""computer sweat"", then to sweat beads, real quick.Ever seen rust on mobo's? That's computer sweat settling in.Water and electricity don't match; you'd need a dehumidifier running 24/7 but then you lose your cold temp since a dehu is a small heater.Once this computer sweat is materialized and melted by the chip heat, turns to water.This makes it at high risk of fire because water can cause serious short circuits. Either way, you'd be better off with S3's since the C1 is designed to be liquid coo<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 2:
Short answer: No

### Reply 3:
You can always modified by putting in some heat sink, aluminum or copper wire and glue it to the center of the chip then fan would helps. But I recommend you not to do it unless you really know what you are doing.

### Reply 4:
I highly doubt it water is amazing at absorbing heat.

### Reply 5:
why ""only 4 fans""? the C1 has a singluar fan. the other 3 are in the cooling loop and will have zero effect if you dont circulate a coolant.unless you planned to circulate air - in which case your pump will last about 5 minutes.tldr; dont buy something designed for liquid cooling and think it will be fine without liquid or cooling.

### Reply 6:
C1 has internal heatsinks and with temp around zero they can work at 225Mhz without liquid cooling, but temperatures can reach 70C on blades which I do not recommend.

### Reply 7:
there is so much surface area on the waterblocks that you might need 10000cfm of air at 0c to keep it running

### Reply 8:
I'm not sure how you will use 4 fans if not using water. But without water it get's to hot and will turn off. I can say I had a cold ambient temp (was months ago in winter) when my syscooling pumps died. It ran and turned off. If you want aircooled your better off with a different miner.

### Reply 9:
Have you ever seen C1? I don't think so. It has not only water block, but also small heatsinks on each blade. It is sufficient when underclocked and even better also undervolted. In case of total failure of fan and pump, after it reaches 100C (or a bit more) it put itself into halt mode with low power consumtion. Bitmain did very good job here.

### Reply 10:
I actually think its possible. If you fill the block with water and close it again it should be able to remove enough heat with very cold ambient air. You might get issues with leaks due to the pressure and plastic caps though.

### Reply 11:
Water required a lot of energy to heat up.

### Reply 12:
The real question is why are you trying to torture your C1?If the room is -1 any temperature, just stick a bucket of coolant next to it with a submersible pump and stick both the intake and the out in the bucket of coolant the cold room will be enough to cool the coolant so the C1 will be happy.Don't torture your miners, love them.

### Reply 13:
it's all about <truncated> it straight to water mains! careful with the pressureorother idea might be doing a siphon system with a big bucket, water jug, 55gallon drum

### Reply 14:
No, unless you put in a heatsink and therma paste (please don't use chocolate as therma paste) into the core then only you can cool it with fan.

### Reply 15:
I really would highly recommend against it. I don't think it is a good idea to risk it if you can bring the water cooling along anyways. Maybe if you hook up a heat sink like someone said above.

### Reply 16:
Please use a chocolate on top of yourself Banana, it might to make you more useful than suggesting stupid things. If you don't know anything about it, do not suggest please.C1 has four heatsinks and two water blocks. With thermal paste from Bitmain, of course. It is enough to cool C1 at cold ambient only by air when underclocked to 225MHz. All Antminers have overtemperature control which stops mining at 80C+, and undocumented failure control which shuts down system at temps over 100C. It is not recommended to run any device at high temperatures, but IC chips used by Bitmain has guaranteed working temperature at 125C (with lower efficiency).

Topic: Creating nonsense fork in blockchain
### Original post:
It is just a stupid question. Imagine if I start mining over an old block which already has many subsequent blocks, find a new block and submit to the network. Will they accept it and create a nonsense fork?I know it is the longest chain that really matters, but would the network accept my block, creating the new fork or simply reject it?

### Reply 1:
Only work for the current block is sent out. If you submit a hash for a past block it will be rejected, probably as stale or not meeting current difficulty.

### Reply 2:
That block will be simply orphaned.To do a fork you need to make your own client with its specific rules, and distribute it to people who will use it.

### Reply 3:
Yeah I understand the block would become orphaned. But would the other nodes add it to their databases or reject it?

### Reply 4:
It would not be orphaned. Work for old blocks is no longer sent. Only work for the current block is sent. So hashes for past blocks would be rejected.

He will probably profit since he has free electricity and the resources. But it also depends on the price of bitcoin after an year or so, as that would also determine if you would profit. Since it isn't too profitable, I would also suggest not starting with it.

Start here and *REALLY* research!<link>

### Reply 5:
If you have cheap electricity, get one of these, but make sure your electrical circuit can handle this:<link> you don't have 208V power outlet or higher, just skip mining altogether.But if you fulfill this requirement, get one of these, mine for like 2 months, then resell the shit out of it...boom profit!Otherwise, mining is really a zero sum game. Too many factors involved: delivery not on time if ever, pre orders are mostly scam/long con, electrical hazard leading to home or building fires, electrical and cooling costs to keep equipment from overheating, difficulty too high and pool luck variance, constantly monitoring and maintaining the equipment is a pain...Alot of things have to bounce right for a miner to even come close to even, or just to minimize loss.It's basically the opposite of the Hunger Games mantra ""May the odds never be in your favor"".

hi,i have this cables come with computer C13 10A-230V (0.75mm)why there power supply using C13 in first place ?they should use C19 to find cord with 2mm

### Reply 1:
C13 is the most common and easiest to find connector. Yes many computer cords using it are too thin, I've seen some as small as 18ga which is only good for 8 amps. But - the C13 is available with cords up to 16ga rated for 13amps and those are what you need.Example for North American 110vac <link> the C19 plugs/sockets are rated for higher current but are also harder to find.

### Reply 2:
i need cee 7/7 schuko - c13 16amp on amazoni can't find one!

### Reply 3:
found one finally <link>

### Reply 4:
Personally, when I have trouble finding the right plug/socket combination, I either just get a cord that has one end right (usually the C13) and then go to a hardware store and buy wire it yourself plug to match what I have on the wall to replace the one that is wrong.

### Reply 5:
These guys have some options: <link> Oh I think I see your problem. The 2mm is referring to the width so something like the European equivalent to American wire gauge.EDIT2: <link>

Topic: Creating a Hashing chip?
### Original post:
i started this out in the newbies forum but i recently got out of there so i thought here would be a better place to post.my factory has an assembly line for ic/ chips but we were doing mostly receivers, lnb/ satellite tv accessories. we grab parts from china and assemble in indonesia so we have all needed equipment to assemble. labor is cheap here and i already have an assembly line for this sort of thing. i thought might aswell make some asic miners for u all.my problem is the chip design/ acquiring the chips. anyone know a good chip designer and anyone know a rough estimate? anyone here want to help me out or knows about this sorta thing?

### Reply 1:
Read up buddy, don't do the short cut or lazy way. make an effort and read the postings.

### Reply 2:
At this point if you don't develop for at least 28nm or smaller then it really is pointless and even at that point you may get your NRE back but your customer base may not achieve ROI.

### Reply 3:
Let's see a 45nm REAL chip before asking for 28nm.....

### Reply 4:
Maybe but I am starting to think doubtful because of the development time and the NRE associated. Right now the trend seems to be die-shrinking. If it does come, I think it will likely be from the existing ASIC manufacturers who already have R&D sunk in and an existing pipeline.

### Reply 5:
NRE costs are around a couple hundred thousand to a few million dollars, depending on the chip feature size (could be anywhere from 130nm to 28nm - or you could spend tens of millions and go all the way down to 14nm).If you have that much money sitting around you can definitely do it. Otherwise you can acquire chips from companies that sell bulk chips. Bitfury is probably the best bet, since they actually have chips and are selling them, although right now raw chips are 1BTC each: <link> will be selling 28nm raw chips, you can order them here: <link>

It was $2.25M of direct cash, then admin and legal fees for a year long international merger for an SEC regulated company probably got them into $3.xxMBTCS is a publicly listed stock on OTC, meaning many of the shareholders are average people with mortgages and families to feed. Spondoolies was the one with 'rich' investors comprising of single wealthy individuals and VCs.

Bitcoin mining with GPUs is obsolete.

### Reply 2:
Although I cannot answer your question specifically, please understand that your task is completely academic.. meaning that you task will teach you, and help learn/understand the process, but not benefit you financially in any way.Please don't take this the wrong way.. I was GPU mining back when difficulty was 12 Million, and 10 GPUs would net about 1 bitcoin every two weeks... plus or minus as machines kept dying in the summer heat.. Difficulty is currently 59 Billion, 335 Million, 351 thousand, and change.., or significantly higher than my example... Today, those 10 GPUs would only net me pennies, per month.. The only benefit would be to offset the heat cost in the house, or educational.If your goal is educational, I'm sure several people on the forum would gladly donate old mining gear to you for the cost of shipping -- and you would burn far less electricity than a GPU, and be able to dive right in to Asic history.If your goal is to obtain bitcoin, it's best just to buy it.

### Reply 3:
Ohh wow didn't know the difficulty was that high :\ Guess that's the issue thenYeah I'm just doing it out of curiosity to learn, really? that would be awesome!Thanks for the info

### Reply 4:
You are mining with the wrong algorithm. In your command you have it mining with scrypt, not sha256.

### Reply 5:
Ohh okay, so this should fix it?

### Reply 6:
You can't, you can't mine SHA256d in an academic perspective. You can replace your ""scrypt"" to ""sha256"" or try blank. Not sure for that particular CGminer version, you're using a pretty old one. But you'll be making a few cents per year at most, it would take you years to reach minimum payout at a pool and you'd be using tons of electricity.I point you toward the Altcoin mining support section. You can get started with X11.

### Reply 7:
Okay, whats that?

### Reply 8:
It's an algo for Altcoins, another coin, one that can be mined with GPU perhaps profitably, depending on your electricity cost, unlike BTC.Since this is the Bitcoin-only board, i can't really elaborate on it much. I would recommend you make a thread in the altcoin section and if you want, post the link here to continue the conversation with me/us.

I took mine apart to see what was going wrong a long time ago. The 3 main caps and main fuse going into the PCB are blowing- creating the white powder.

I know what your saying, I had a small cap fall out as well. I had one almost blowout in my face.

### Reply 3:
What voltage do these thing run on and what kind of plug do you need?

### Reply 4:
They run on the standard 110-120volts, and it comes with a special 3-prong cords that plugs into a normal residential wall socket.

Duh. I mean what comes out the other side of that power supply and what kind of wattage requirements does it have? Is it 12 volts like most of the other BYO PSU ASICs?

### Reply 7:
It may have been mentioned but I wanted to show evidence and make sure people knew. Have one almost blow up in your face and you may want to warn a few people to hopefully save a fire or two I have known they burn out but the fire and exploding inside was new to me. Thats all.-D

4 out of 6 of my BFL OEM PSUs have failed. One day I came home to my entire house smelling like it was on fire. A burning plastic type smell. Sure enough, it was one of the BFL PSUs. After that I threw away the 2 working ones and bought some SeaSonic PSUs.

5770 is your best bet though you may be able to run across a used 5830. I will be selling several 5770s next week for less than $100 USD equivalent in BTC, each shipped to USA. PM me if interested.Edit: there you go, NewEgg previous post.

they seem to have a ~5%+ DOA rate, still worth it

Definitely the 5830. By far the best value for that pricerange. I just picked up 3 of them myself, as all of the reasonably priced 5850's were backordered and 5870's are nearly non-existant at this point.

no budget = unlimited funds or 0 funds?unlimited, the 6990 of course, 0 funds, whatever you have of course If you game etc, I find the 6950 1GB to be the best value, if only mining, it is hard to say.... 4* 5970 or 4* 6990 would be best on a single motherboard cost effective-wise... Used 5970 @ 400$ each would be phenomenal value. But with such high difficulty, idk if buying a rig only for mining is the smartest idea

### Reply 15:
Yeah, it's true. With difficulty jumping 60%+ this time around, and projected to jump another 50-60% the next time around, and possibly again, it'll be much more profitable to dump the monies into bitcoins themselves, and hope the value of them goes up.

if you have a sempron, no games would run well, so the CPU would be a ""bottleneck"" Think a neck of the bottle, which limits the amount of fluid the goes through.I find i5 2500K systems to be cheap for what they are also99.99$, GREAT price

RAGEEEEEEEI just bought three of those for $30 more than I needed to!I guess they'll be here two days earlier than if I had ordered them now though... 2 days of mining @ 800MH/s = 5.67 BTC = $36.87. So I guess I'm ok.

So I got an ASIC 330mh/s block erupter I set it up and started mining. All was fine inside cgminer I got a best share of like 73 so I was happy. I left this running for about 5 hours then I checked my pool and there is NOTHING it says it's inactive running 0mh/s and I have no balance. I have tried multiple pools and even diffident coins. No change

First, that block erupter is useless, you will earn nothing.Second, what pool are you mining on? It's probably because even the share difficulty is too high, lol.

SkyscraperFarms Guide to setting up a Block Erupter Cube 30-38GH/s in WindowsI spent a few aggravating hours trying to set one of these babies up. Most guides gloss over a lot of the settings. This is my attempt to help make it easier for some of you.(**) these are the areas where I had most difficulty and it seems most people did not have these issues.(*) is only pertinent to those setting up multiple cubes. If you are only setting up 1 cube, ignore these * hints.1. Tighten/re-screw heat sink screws. Every cube I received had this problem. You will need to unscrew both front and back plates. Unplug cooling fan. Carefully slide the board and blades out all together. There are guide rails that the blades may get stuck on from shifting and you may need to adjust so it slides out evenly. Make sure all screws in heat sinks are tight. Then reassemble.2. Attach to PSU. You will need a PSU with at least two 6pin PCI-E cables on it and runs at 280W, preferably more.3. Insert 30amp Fuse into Cube. I had a few fuses start to melt until I only pushed them in partially, enough to make the connection. (This only happened on high when the unit starts to get really hot, an external fan helped too<rest of post truncated>

Actually this is a group buy that needs to hit 250 units the resellers don't have the minimum order placement of 250 and it doesn't seem like we are undercutting each other, you pay the price you get the unit when it arrives no worrying about x amount of units left (except if they are all sold out).I'm not saying its a bad thing if you get enough people to do a purchase it will help you out immensely.

### Reply 6:
Yeah that's exactly why i'm offering just slightly under the re-sellers currently, I didn't want to do it but I do have to hit 250 orders minimum like tomas_s has mentioned to become an authorized re-seller. And since this is my first ever group buy I want to prove to the community I am more then capable of handling this type of task.I do appreciate everyone's input and thank this community for giving me the opportunity to sell bitcoin mining hardware.

your pricing structure put me out of reselling sticks. simple math. the other sellers offer 20 sticks for .85 each and 1 stick for .9 each. if I buy 20 sticks at .85 and sell 2 at 1.77 my profit was .07 btc. and the guy buying 2 sticks from me saved .03 btc .. your pricing of 1-20 at .88 means 2 sticks are .176 so I get no sales. I have 0 incentive to buy from ssinc in amounts of 20 sticks. while business is business you are hurting other resellers like myself which in turn will hurt ssinc , dabs and Thomas_s I never begrudge anyone trying to make a buck and I will link your post to the bitminter forum letting them know that small 2 stick sales would be cheaper with you.

Its about the current generation. Its not about being a scam, its the overall feeling about their CURRENT products which are delayed and yet to be delivered. Using your proposed logic we'd have to call BFL reputable because they delivered FPGAs.

Thanks for explanation, however black arrow also does not refund nor buyer has a right to request it. I do not know bitmine tos, so they might have same tos regarding refund request as black arrow.

They delivered lancelots and miners based on bitfury chips, so bitmine deserve the same ""yes"" as they have delivered avalon clones.

You may want to update the information for drillbit to state 'Uses Bitfury and Avalon chips'. As the current drillbit 8-board uses Bitfury chips, same with the current drillbit USB thumb.The next models are using Avalon v2 chips and it looks like they will come as a USB thumb, 8-chip board, and 16-chip board, but they aren't released yet. Honestly, I doubt many of the Avalon boards will be made, I'm pretty certain they will go either back to Bitfury (if avail) or whatever the next generation chip is/will be.

### Original post:
In regard to the last couple comments, 1.3.0 is now available...Coins can now be created, edited, and modified in Coin Manager, accessible in Settings tab -> 'Other Tools...' button menu. You can also set to not remove individual coins, even if they drop from CoinChoose. (coins used in any of your profiles are already not removed)Also notifications are displayed when new coins are found on CoinChoose, in case you want to get a head start on mining. If you don't happen to see the notification, a log entry is also created. (you can turn this off in the Settings tab)Also profile switching should once again be skipped if the profile is already in use so the miner won't be restarted.I did make some minor changes that should hopefully improve API enabling, but if you still have this issue please send me the debug report created in the Tests tab.

Oddly enough this particular code has not been changed in any recent versions.CGMiner is starting, right? CGWatcher is just not picking it up?

I'm sorry, that was a misunderstanding on my part. I didn't realize the miner actually wasn't starting (so the IsProcessAlive function was working properly). Please try 1.3.0.2, I think I have fixed this problem and a few others related to starting the miner. If this doesn't fix it, please try starting the miner using 1.3.0.2, then after it fails to start go to the Tests tab and click Create Debug Report, and email me the information displayed.

I have another small problem. When I press the button ""Disable device"", everything works fine, GPU is disabled. But when scheduler is switching profiles or miner restarts, device starts to work again, and I have to press the button again to disable the device. How can I disable the device for a long time, with using switching profiles? or it can be fixed?

### Reply 7:
Yeah that disable button applies only to the current miner process, as do any other changes in that tab. Allowing these changes to be saved to the config file (or arguments) is on the to-do list, but I'm not sure how soon I'll get to it.I would suggest instead creating a scheduled action to disable that GPU for whatever period of time you'd like, and when creating the action check the ""Persist through miner restarts..."" checkbox so it is re-applied if the miner is restarted. Hold your mouse over this checkbox to see more information on when it is or isn't re-applied.

Topic: trouble setting up solo mining with bitcoinqt and bfgminer.
### Original post:
Hi everyone,I have been trying to set up solo mining (just interested in learning how to hook up to the network) using bitcoinqt and bfgminer as advised, but I cant seem to quite get there even after searching all over the internet. I have successfully installed bitcoinqt and bfgminer, and I am pool mining with btcguild. I have made a bitcoin.conf file with the following in it and put it in the home/.bitcoin <truncated> I have no idea if bitcoinqt is running as a server when I open it...? When I try to run bfgminer in the terminal and enter the url - <link> username and password, it tells me ""pool set up failed"", also without asking me for a bitcoin address to direct mined bitcoins to.I must be doing something obvious wrong, but I just cant figure it out. I would be very grateful if somebody could point out what Im doing wrong.

### Reply 1:
the url you are using to connect to the pool that must be working and workers username and passwords must be registered on the same poolas you are using btcguild then you must enter this <truncated> as your stratum so your username and password can connect your miner on btcguild pool to start mining. so the mistake you are making is replace your localhost and port with this and try again it will start working the method which you have read to start ming is for eligius i think well try this and i hope it will be working.ping me on skype if you any questions x.c0der

HelloSorry for not providing any updates but as you know I was busy collecting email addresses from group buyers.At the moment I am working on automating payouts, that's why I need your email addresses (each participant will be able to log in to his own mining cabinet and make payouts when he want's to).I have also received tracking numbers, it should be delivered on monday according to UPS tracking system.Data center is set up, PSU's are waiting, so we are ready to go.Probably tommorow or at sunday each group buyer will receive email with further instructions and acces to his mining cabinet.How did I even missed all that new posts in this thread asking for updates...

I informed Polmine via PM to one of their forum admins.

### Reply 3:
I would recommend posting the full source code. Until then I and anyone else is going to recommend keeping this far off of any computer that has a digital currency wallet or credentials. It is simply not worth the risk.The same can and is said about any direct executable download posted on this forum.If you look through the forum you'll see plenty of posts just like yours. They usually get quickly deleted or buried in responses saying ""do not download this"".If you'd like to avoid this and get folks using your software, post the source code.

### Reply 4:
The problem is that i not have the source code.This program as not been coded by me.All that i can give you is a scan report.

### Reply 5:
Again - nobody is going to download this and I will continue to tell people not to.Just because a virus scanner doesn't pick it up doesn't mean it should be trusted. The author could easily be diverting the hashing to his own pool at a small percentage just by using the built in features in BFGMiner and cgminer.

### Reply 6:
I understand... Except that i don't have the source code then i can't modify it for redirect any percentage to my pool.Well, hope this share will make happy someone

Right, but whoever the author is could have done so. Nobody download anything you cannot look at the source for yourself. This could easily be stealing your hashrate or currency or any number of things.

Topic: KnCMiner order/shipment mess and unfairness
### Original post:
How come a company that talks a lot about fairness totally ignores the interests of most their customers?We, the majority who wasn't lucky to be in the right timezone, now have to pay for the few lucky ones got into 1-500 batch?It will be our money that should enable the mere production of ASIC devices, yet we will silently step aside to let the few gunshots reap the rewards. That's what KnCMiner call fair. I called them out with the email to give the exact estimation and placement of my order but didn't hear back. This is probably because KncMiner fair process cant be judged by a random dude from the > 500 order batch.

### Reply 1:
Just to clarify for you, You would have been in the 1-500 batch if you placed a pre-order during an approximately week long period in April after they first announced their miners (so it has nothing to do with timezone, but you're right you needed to be aware of their existence). What has happened now, is they are giving 7 days to those people with pre-orders to pay and confirm their spot in the queue. The possible unfairness is that some people placed pre-orders (at no cost) with no intention of every paying for an order and now those people are able to sell their pre-order slots at a premium. I actually don't think this is unfair, those people had the foresight to place a pre-order and now others want it so they can demand a premium. That is how a free market works. Full disclosure: I did buy a pre-order slot from someone and have placed an order with knc and I was happy to do it.

### Reply 2:
Also as someone else rightly pointed out in one of the other threads; KnC used those figures pertaining interest to coerce ORSoC on board.ORSoC wanted to be given an idea numbers of interest before agreeing to partner. Those guys and girls keen then helped KnC secure ORSoC as a partner. KnC were never going to attempt this without ORSoC on board, so there is fairness there.

### Reply 3:
Absolutely, you can't get a company like ORSoC to partner with you without demonstrating that there is a demand for the product you are developing and that is exactly what pre-orders do.I don't know why people are complaining about having to pay now. They accept credit cards via paypal, so if you are really concerned that they won't come through, that is one way to do it with minimal risk.I'll be very interested to hear the feedback after the open day tomorrow.

### Reply 4:
Yea I signed up for the newsletter on 4/09/2013 thinking ok I registered interest, HAD THEY POSTED ""Sign up here to get a place in line"" I would have but of course I thought to myself no need they aren't even taking money. ***Face Palm!***

### Reply 5:
It is still not fair when 2000 fund the development of something when 500 lucky ones get the reward.I didn't pay yet, so did not the majority, so hold on your breath you 500 gunshots, without us your order number is meaningless.I give KncMiner 6 days to let me know my order shipment estimated delivery date

### Reply 6:
I don't get the unfairness part.You could have reserved your place in april. The reservation list was open for a week.You can order now and probably be in the first 500 anyway.p.s. And I'm definitely in the wrong timezone.

### Reply 7:
Same here :-)

### Reply 8:
I registered in April on the site and for the newsletter, there was no word I should've taken the queue.Now they need to deal with their incompetence somehow, it's no good when thousands of suckers make 500 random dudes rich.Remember, without us your 500 spots are nothing

### Reply 9:
Random dudes that helped them secure a shit-hot FPGA/ASIC design house?! Bastards...

### Reply 10:
You do know the 500 are also paying customers right?

### Reply 11:
That's one way of going further - they do it like Avalon and only take money for the number of devices they gonna ship.Then do the next batch. I'm sure for the next batch the price will be lower because of the competition.I'm not paying till they clarify my shipment date.

### Reply 12:
So at the end of it, you're saying it's unfair that you didn't get into the first 500 orders? What happens if you order now and get #501?And why do you keep mentioning 2000 to fund the development and 500 lucky ones getting the rewards? According to the order page, all products will be delivered in september.

Excellent! That works perfectly.Is it possible to get the script to email me with an update of temps every hour and an email if the temperature exceeds high?Also how do I set this script to run automatically in the background and how to let me know if it's failed?Thanks a mill.

### Reply 5:
I was thinking, oh this is no problem just add one line so it sends an email.BUT this was a little bit more complicated. Because if the temp is at the $HIGH warning point, it sleeps 2 seconds and the goes on again. If I just put a mail command there it sends a mail every few seconds, probably not so good LOL.So I made a timestamp and check if it sent mail in the last 5 minutes(found that here: <link> how to make it send the ok temps every hour? I now made it log the tempsto a file, so you can make a cronjob that mails it to you every hour <truncated> I think this script had a bug, the shutdown stuff never executed becauseeven if you reach $SHUTDOWN_TEMP, the temp is higher then the $HIGH tempand so it never went into the else loop. Moved that shutdown stuff at the beginning now,so it gets checked first. But I probably created more bugs now haha You can start the script with a $ at the end, so it keeps running in the background.Maybe you have a startup script for your miners, then you can just add it at the <truncated> 1 2 3 4 <truncated> truedo for card in $CARDS; do # read temp TEMP=$(DISPLAY=:0 aticonfig --adapter=$card --odgt |grep 'Sensor'|awk -F\ '{ print $5 }'|cut -d. -f1) if<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 6:
Whoops, thanks for noticing that, of course you are right

### Reply 7:
I actually took out the high temp part and just left in the shutdown part. My room is air conditioned so if the temp is ever up to that then there's something seriously wrong and it should be shut down. My setup would not warrant clocking gpu's down for cooling.Also I used a little program called sendEmail, it allows you to send email from the command line with minimal setup (very basic). I put all my details into a second script and call it from the first. It will tell me that the temp has exceeded and it's shutting down - just so I'm aware!

### Reply 8:
Perhaps you should go to cgminer.It has control system over fan and engine clock (you can switch them or not) in order to set temperature under fixed target (by default 75C). You can define highest temp to stop mining (def. 85C) and highest temp to keep away (def. 95C).Give it a try. It's sticked in top ten.

We you on ars previously? - your setup is in my head from the pictures I have seen. Just wondering why you switched to this new pool - just had a quick browse to the site and it's looks like it's just starting off. It's hard to understand how it works though...

### Reply 3:
BAMT looks interesting but those munin plugins don't allow you to zoom in on the charts for a closer look. I find that annoying.

### Reply 4:
Yes, I was on ars previously. The DGM payout method is better because it is more like PPS in that the pool owner will cover some of the variance. Ars has also been having stability issues of late and that hurts profits.I never look at the charts. The features that are most valuable are monitoring over ssh with mgpumon, email notification of issues, being able to switch the entire farm over without changing every config and the ease of setup. It took me hours to setup a windows system. BAMT is setup in minutes.

### Reply 5:
Yeah ars has been having issues but I'm using their second server since today which has been fine. I'll have to look into this DGM method...What your saying isn't clear to me though? You say it's more like PPS because of the variance, yet, you say it's better without giving the reason?

### Reply 6:
Sorry for not being more clear.Straight PPS == the pool owner takes all of the variance riskPPLNS == you take all of the varianceSMPPS == when the pool is lucky, btc is held back for unlucky times but the pool does not share in the burden if it is very unlucky, miners must dig themselves out of the holeDGM == the variance is shared between the pool owner and miners<link> has also implemented poolserverj correctly so my stales are like .04% and they have a working implementation of merged mining which is extra profit.

### Reply 7:
I'm just trying out this yourbtc pool now, can you mine just bitcoin. I still don't know why I should care about namecoin.

### Reply 8:
Merged mining allows for you to do the same work but get paid more. Probably the one and only reason I care. yourbtc.net will automatically sell the nmc and convert it to btc for you anyway, so it's like mining bitcoin alone.

Topic: Does it sound right? Estimating the hashrate of CPU likely used to Mine Genesis
### Original post:
I am trying to estimate the cost of mining Genesis block for a research paper and wish to narrow down variables to the best i can. Here is how i got the ~8228 h/s hashrate.1- I took the difference between the block-header epoch timestamp of Genesis and block#1 which turned out to be 506,360 seconds (i.e 5.86 days).2- The nonce of Genesis Block is 2083236893 which means that satoshi proved the work on genesis block by performing 4,166,473,786 sha-256 hashing operations (2,083,236,893 nonce increments and ""Double"" sha 256 operations per nonce).Hoping the math is correct, it means that the device used for mining Genesis block performed at 8228 h/s hashrate (4,166,473,786 hashing operations / 506,360 seconds) .Is the above calculated hashrate close to the one you'd expect from CPU mining back in 2009? any notes on the math used here?

### Reply 1:
Interesting question!A quick web search reveals that people in 2011 were doing 65kHash/s on a single thread. Disconnected from Bitcoin Core though; just a simple standalone C program doing SHA256 hashes. <link> very well possible that in 2008, hashrate was quite a bit lower, maybe 10kHash/s on similar hardware; of course, satoshi may have used a laptop giving lower numbers.Your calculation does assume a bunch of things, though:[1] The timestamps are 100% correct. Problem:[2] He started hashing with nonce=0 and incremented by 1. Problem: It's not required nor enforced to do it like that. You could also generate a random number every time or maybe after 1000 iterations and count up from there.That being said, it was the very first version of Bitcoin Core and both assumptions may very well have held true back then. I'm just not 100% sure, since by today things are a lot different; timestamps are even used as a kind of 'extra nonce' and deliberately time-shifted. Just make sure since you are doing this for a research paper, that your assumptions are indeed true.PS: I'd recommend moving this to 'Development & Technical Discussion'.

It adds up, especially since Athlons and Core 2's did not have <truncated> SHA256 instructions to take advantage of, so it was most likely all coded in software (C specifically, not any assembly or even __asm__ directives).

### Reply 3:
Thanks a lot n0nce.I didn't know about the median timestamp. With that said though, and specially for the case of genesis block, would you consider those 2 factors to be almost insignificant knowing that satoshi mined genesis Block alone (no competing nodes)? Note: Am new on here, is there a way I can move the topic to ""Development & Technical Discussion"" or shall I just delete and re-post?One last thing, nonce-search tweaking/algorithm is one of the topics am very interested in, but couldn't find any good enough sources to put some algorithms to test on a Mac just for fun. any recommendation?I really appreciate the time you've taken and I learned something interesting today!

### Reply 4:
The timestamp can be adjusted forwards or backwards to the miner's will, no matter whether there is competition or not. Same with the way the nonce is selected. But I don't know why he would have done something like that. Most likely, your assumptions hold true. I'm also not aware, when exactly miners started playing with the timestamp as secondary nonce.This would be a question probably best answered by long-time miners from the Mining board, like philipma1957 and NotFuzzyWarm.On most boards, you can do it yourself just on the bottom left corner.There's even a 'Lesson' about it <link> can quickly find topics using the <link> search tool, by the way. Much better than forum search.Despite my name, I'm not an expert on nonce-search tweaking. I do understand what you're trying to do; personally I'd mostly stick to the maths and maybe write an isolated example to gather some benchmarks. But in theory, mining is a completely random process and you should not get any better or worse results in the long run whether you just count up or do something more complex.

### Reply 5:
While it may have been able to be adjusted to any value initially, the genesis block clearly states the earliest date it could have been generated.Read the coinbase sig.Alas, bitcoin rules (which means all mining) sets limits on the value it can have as stated above.As I regularly state when the subject of the 'block timestamp' comes up, the stamp is not 'the time the block was mined'It is either when the pool sent the work to the miner or what it was adjusted to by mining code (or the pool).But adjusting the timestamp is no longer required with stratum, and all pools other than those setup by n00bs who don't know what they are doing, use stratum.Stratum was designed for this reason, to put extra nonces in the coinbase sig, not use the timestamp.This u<rest of thread truncated>

Topic: Antminer S3 Keeps resetting itself
### Original post:
Good Morning GuysI wish my first post wasn't a ""problem"" post but like so many, I found your site looking for some rhyme or reason as to the behaviour of my nice new Antminer S3+ (batch 9)Set it up last night and all was good - hashing away at about 430-450 Gh/s as expected. Came to look at it this morning and is seems to be cuttin out all together, suddenly coming back to life as the right speed then 10 minutes later dropping off to zero before restarting again. This is after about 12 hours continuous running if that helps?Now, I also have an Antminer S1 running and another S3 running elsewhere, both of which are behaving as they should which rules out the mining pool. I know the configuration within the unit must be right or it wouldn't be mining at all which again, rules that out.I have this set up with an Aerocool Intergrator 600W +80W PSU (<link> using the daisy chained connector. Could this be causing an abnormal load on the PSU? Would it work better if the individual plugs were used?I am also hardwired into an Ethernet Hub so no wireless connection issues.Can anyone shed any light on this as I need to get this running properly obviously?Thanks

### Reply 1:
PSU should be ok as its a single rail so should have no issues no matter if your using one or two cables. I am wondering what the temp on the miner is getting up to? You can see the temp on the status page. You would be better to post this on the S3 thread than start a new one. <link>

### Reply 2:
Thanks for the reply - I'm in work at the moment so can't interrogate the unit but I'll try that when I get back. I have purposefully positioned it so it has a clear air path all around (I work in building services so understand that in order to maximise cooling, there needs to be open air around all sides, similar to a water to air heat exhanger).It is just baffling me why it would effectively shut off, restart and run fine for 10 minutes before repeating the process.I'll copy this into the S3 thread (didn't know it existed - oops - newbie alert )

I stopped giving a crap for a couple weeks but now I'm back and now BFL's website has actual pictures of the finished product. That means they have some chips, are assembling and testing some, and are obviously close to shipping. They might even be packaging right now. Their original statement that they later buried was that they were realistically going to ship right before Christmas. Then they said October so everyone placed their pre-orders with their company instead of their competition. Then they backpedaled and kept saying ""well, we don't know though"" and ""it might be later"" and tada, we're back at reality where we started from.Also, the Steve Jobs in that cartoon would be where he's going already if he wasn't using Apple Maps.

Topic: Looking for 2nd opinions
### Original post:
I'm looking for some second opinions about the longevity of my setup. I have 3x6970 in one rig and another 1x5870 hashing away.Current settings using cgminer on the 6970s are:950/685 (mem is lowest I can get without flashing BIOS)V=1.175 (can't adjust in cgminer or afterburner)I = 9Fan = 85% on 2 cards, 95% on the hottest cardTemp = 79C on Hottest card, 70C on coolest.Powertune = 10@ 425 m/hash eachCurrent settings using cgminer on the 5870 are:980/350V = 1.130I=9Fan = 40%Temp = 53CPowertune = 0 (Can't adjust for this card on cgminer)@405 m/hashMy questions:1) Is 950 core or 79C too much/high for the 6970?2) Is 980 core (stock 850) too high for the 5870?3) Are the fan speeds on the 6970s an issue? They are HIS 6970s.4) Most importantly, does an increased core clock affect the longevity of a card independent of temperature and voltage? I assume 53C and 40% fan to be no concern, but does a +130mhz overclock present a problem for longevity in and of itself?I'd really not like my card warranties to be voided because I leave some burns somewhere or something.

### Reply 1:
All by itself, the clock does not influence the longevity in any way.However, power consumption and dissipation rise linearly along with clock speed and those two factors are the chip killers when the microscopically small traces inside the chip ""burn up"" (actually, it's electromigration that kills them - a process where electric current displaces molecules of the conductor it's running through).Load (heat and current) also leads to degradation of transistors inside the chip to the point where they become unstable at speeds they used to run at without any issues. If your card suddenly starts crashing where it used to run stably for months dropping the clocks is the only solution.95% fan speed (or even 85%) is something you should worry about. When manufacturers cut corners, fan quality goes first. Chances are that when purchasing inexpensive 10$ case fans you are getting much higher quality devices than the ones mounted on your 300$ card...70..79C is not a bad temperature range for a battery of overclocked 6970s locked in a PC case. If it's an open rig, try increasing the distance between cards or pointing more airflow directly at them.It's a bloody damned shame that your manufture<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 2:
Thanks for the input.The voltage is strange on the 6970s -- I can't adjust voltage on any of the cards, but one is at 1.150 and the other two are at 1.175. Go figure.They are all locked in the case but I'm likely going to open the case and direct a desktop fan towards it.

### Reply 5:
that's going to have a tendancy to cause condensation and other nasty things

### Reply 6:
Why do people always get this shit backwards? If you place something cold in a warm/hot environment, the air near the cold thing gets supersaturated with water vapor and condenses on the surface. If you place something hot in a cold environment, the air near the hot thing will accept a much larger amount of water vapor compared to the environment and will NEVER condense. The worst you'll see in this setup is fog in the air.

### Reply 7:
A mining rig has mulitple temperatures throughout it's going to cause ""fog"" near the exhaust and condensation on it's cooler components. but feel free to test this and report back with video

I have nothing bad to say about Avalon personally.But it does seem to me for the great amount of business they are doing, and the great products they have, a little bit would go a long way. I'm sure in China it would be fairly inexpensive to hire a min wage dedicated secretary or customer service person to assist with running the day-to-day stuff, while Yifu and the other BTC champions can be freed up to do more important stuff. Even just having a full-time employee in this sort of role doing this one day a week would really help the situation out massively.

If you don't know the name of the country you are in, it might be hard for Avalon to deliver your unit regardless of which carrier they use.

I think it's the only way forward. They have the money, they are making a huge mark up on their bulk chips.In his recent talk at Bitcoin 2013 he admitted the team hate the customer service aspect and want to concentrate on development and engineering, that's what motivates them.That's understandable, I'd be like that too, but you can't afford to loose sight of the fact if your customers are unhappy, you don't get the funding for development and it's such an easy fix to to hire someone to make your life more efficient and rewarding and keep your customer base happy as well.

Ngzhang or yifu sure hasfamilies or relatives in china, hire these people and is common knowledge that factories bosses always prefer to hire their own family members to work for them and getting 1 or 2 person in the help desk should not be an issue.

Topic: Batch file for mining
### Original post:
Hi,This is a method to do mine hopping the way you want on Windows (tested on Windows 7 and above).The question is: i want to mine on pool x for so much time, solo for this much, on pool y for some other time and then cycle again.There problem is evident if you have only 1 hardware device, but if you have more than one device you can use Multiminer to tell each device what to mine. This kind of gives half a solution, because if you have a 10 GHs unit and a 100 GHs, you cannot split it 50-50. Also, some might say that running one device for a long period of time is/isn't equivalent to running one faster device for a shorter period of time, so the total number of lotto tickets is the same, as with time the later tickets might have less chance (point of view).Anyway, here is the code:1. Download cgminer and put it in a folder of its own, say ""cgminer-3.12.2""2. Create a batch file inside that folder, call it whatever.bat (.bat makes it an executable batch file)3. Put the code below in the file (please read it as you need to personalize it to your <truncated> cgminer.exe -o 127.0.0.1:nnn -u username -p passwordtimeout /t 120 /nobreaktaskkill /im cgminer.exe /f /s localhost /u yourwindow<rest of post truncated>

Why, Just use --load-balance and feed both pools simultaneously, you can even change the balance between the pools so one receives more shares than the other.

### Reply 2:
Hi,Thank for the feedback. With load balance and a number of miners (more than 10), 24 hrs of mining on ghash.io gave 50% duplicates. The equipment keeps jumping from one pool to another. It did not work for me...More precisely, the way i used --load-balance was by downloading Multiminer's source code from github and making some tweaks. That said, it relies on how the parameter was implemented in the software, I have not tested it myself directly in command line, just relied on feedback from the experience. I might give it a try but atm it feels better to have 100% all in one lump on one load. It's really a matter of personal decision, consider the two positions:One: i have a couple of USB miners not using anymore, I'm running them solo mining bitcoin, who knows, I might get lucky, I know the odds are probably I will find it in 800 days, and that is assuming the difficulty does not increase in 800 days, but it is better than having them making cents on cex.io.Two: if the odds are too low to win, then it is better to have them making cents on cex.io (no ad intended) rather than making nothing in solo.So the idea is, even if --load-balance was to work properly, some might not think i<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
I bought very cheap AMD Sempron CPUs. If you plan to have uses other than mining, you may want to upgrade a bit. I didn't2 GB RAM is fine if you just want the machine for mining. I have many machines with just 2 GB and they hash wellThere are several MB choices. I have personally had good luck with the ASRock 970 Extreme 4, as have others on the forum. At $99, it's decently priced for the PCIx slots it has too.I bought 1200 watt PSUs for 3 x 7970s machines they all handle the load fine. I would say no on the DVD drive. Even if you did need one to install Windows, etc. you wouldn't need to keep it attached once that's done.Cooling is something you want to keep in mind. 3 or 4 7970s in any case are going to run hot, probably very hot. Almost all of my machines are completely opened (custom frames) and have at least one PCIx-extender to raise the middle card up to allow all 3 cards to get better cooling. At about $15 (last I checked) these are worth finding and investing in on the web.

I think this is still very helpful. There are of course newer GPU's but everything else should be good.<link>

Check out the ""pics of your mining rigs"" thread: <link> are several example pics on the most recent pages as of this post: 107 & 108, and I'm sure you can find many more further back in that same thread.

Just one of the risks of sucking lots of juice... Was quite the fireworks show...plenty of sparks and pops and a cute little fire on the roof of the porchHats off to Hydro Quebec...back up mining in under 3 hours.Mind you, if they would have given me the damn upgrade which I've been waiting for for 4 months, this would not have happened.or so I like to tell myself.
