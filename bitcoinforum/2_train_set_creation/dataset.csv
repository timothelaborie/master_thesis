Topic: Advice -Adding additional 6 pin PCIE outputs on a PC modular Power Supply?
### Original post:
Hi AllI have a few modular/semi modular PC psu's and was thinking of using the to pwer some S9 miners with 2 cards. Most of what i have are 1000w or higher.They will be worthless selling so might be better put to use on some S9s powered with2 cards, so i would need x7 ouputs all together.I think i could use an existing hard wired PCIE (6 pin or not) to power the control board.Then on the dedicated high amp PCIE modular ouputs could i not solder on connections and 'share' the load so x2 on each output?I have only seen x8 to x2 PCIE cables so could i not just splice in and solder another?If this works i could do a few more miers in thsi set up as it would be low power and quite when set to 700/800w.Anyone done this or got an opinion on it?The PSU's will either go to waste tbh.Pics attached.<link>

### Reply 1:
@NotFuzzyWarmYes i will be running only 2 boards @ 700w or 800w.Is that why 'common rail' modular PSUs are so expensive?The only PSUs i can see that have enough outputs (X7) are the EVGA ones and they are silly money, i'm surprised that nobody has found a decent PSU and 'modded' them for more outputs tbh.....I just can't find makes that suffice apart from that brand?I think if i open it i can see rails and go from there, 3 on each for the hash boards and an existing 12v ouput for the control board.Thanks for the advice.

### Reply 2:
Looks like the +12v are seperate rails and GND/-12v shared.I will just add an extra pin to each double 8pin >x2 6pin.So i will have a set of two 8pin >x3 6 pins.Current will be approx 800/12=66.67aIs this correct?<link>

### Reply 3:
To be honest, modular plug PSU's all have 1 major problem: They are pushing the maximum current rating through the contacts and generally have only 18ga wires between the PSU and PCIe plugs.Ok, that's 2 major problems...That said, since you are talking about running at reduced power it may not be an issue, just periodically check to see how warm the PSU connectors get. Yes, I've had a few rather spectacularly fry over the years from when I used them to power s3's & s5's...Other thing to keep in mind is that particular PSU has 2 independent output rails. DO NOT connect power from the 2 different rails to 1 hash board! They will be shorted together and fight each other.

Do you have the newest drivers?

### Reply 2:
Usual instructions for when people DONT read the readme.Reconfigure xorg for all devices, start x and export the DISPLAY variable before starting cgminer.

### Reply 3:
I just find it so weird how people dont read something that specifically says ""READ ME!""

### Reply 4:
Ahh, thanks guys I actually was exporting the DISPLAY variable in my mining startup script but I'd stupidly disabled this while installing/testing the card. That seems to have solved that problem! Unfortunately this led me on to a new issue: The Xubuntu computer loses power very quickly when I start mining on the 5970 with anything above intensity 1, but it mines fine (intensity 11) when installed in a different windows machine...When the linux comp powers off, it's without warning I have to wait a little and toggle the PSU switch before turning it on again. Both PC's have adequate PSU's (760W) and the 5790 is the only card being used. So it has me puzzled. Why would mining cause the linux machine to quickly shut off? Temps on the fan never get a chance to hit 80 before the power cuts off.I will start a new thread on this if it comes to me getting completely stuck (I can try a 7870 in the linux computer and see if it has the same problem), but I hoped someone may have a good idea why this is happening? ATI drivers are 11.11Thank you very much for ideas on this one and happy hashing!

He clearly edited the post after you guys have commented, anyhow , this is the miner he is talking about I guess.<link> it does look like an Inno gear with a bit of modification, in that link they clearly saywhich means phill is right, you need at least two PSUs, each must be 1400w minimum , and according to the video, it does look like he got 2 PSUs connected, the miner's fan do spin for a while and then stop , and you saidWhich means you tried to overclock the miner, you either burned the miner or one of the PSUs, does it show on the network ?? can you access the user interface? please post more details.

Do note that the OP has not made any mention of trying to contact the distributor or manufacturer of this knock-off miner. That of course should be the very first thing the OP should have done...Nor have they posted anything else re what has been said so far.

### Reply 5:
He needs to know it's a knock-off in the first place, and honestly if the gear does 32th at 2800w as promised-- it does not matter what name they put on it, as for contacting the manufacturer, honestly this is usually the last thing I personally do simply because1-The support at these Chinese websites is terrible, had a ton of issues with my gears, most were solved by trial and error or from information I got online (mostly on this very forum) , while the manufacturer will give only give you the abc of trouble shooting only.2-In many places, the shipping cost for returning the miner back to china is unreasonable, to the extent that some people rather order new hash board/control board or a PSU than having to pay that much for shipping or wait for months to get their replacement.I think if OP provides enough information and kernel log, someone will be able to give him the solution for this problem without the need for a crystal ball.

Topic: USB Block Erupter showing up as generic USB Device instead of ""Port"", won't mine
### Original post:
I've been mining with two USB Block Erupter Sapphires without issue for at least a week now, properly cooled. Today, I've been messing around with things trying to get my Antminer U2 up and running and must've done something that now causes one of my erupters to show up under Device Manager as a usb device instead of under ""Ports"". When I try to mine with it, it just sits in standby doing nothing. However, if I plug it into my Win 7 machine it comes up normally under ""Ports"" instead of ""Universal Serial Bus Devices"" but I don't have an ethernet to that box to test if it will mine. I'm not sure what exactly is going on with this stick. Is it fried?

### Reply 1:
Maybe you installed a WinUSB driver?

### Reply 2:
Is the problem on a windows xp machine? This may be a device identifier issue. I've never seen it with 3 devices, but I suppose it is possible. There is a fix posted in these forums somewhere and if I have time to dig it up for you I will, but if you keep restarting and plugging it back in to different ports it may eventually pick up properly. Windows XP doesn't handle duplicate usb devices very well.

42W at idle? Good lawd. My x6500 FPGAs only burns up 17.2W at full load...Didn't they like...put a dummy load in place of the ASIC chips and actually test these boards or something while they were waiting on chip delivery?I guess not.

Really? If they were a scam you could expect as realistic a 'prototype test' as they could muster, and I saw nothing in that vid which proved much of anything. It amazes me to see how many people consider a vid of some numbers changing on a screen to be 'proof' of anything more than a tiny amount of scripting ability.You could also expect that they would make the 'test' look just good enough to give people hope (and thus not cancel their pre-orders) but bad enough to have a reason for another bunch of delays.The only thing which gives me some amount of hope is that they made things look worse than they really needed to.As I said for Avalon, I won't believe with a high degree of certainty that they can hash unless they can publish a set of hashes within {x} amount of time of a known dataset being globally available. And even then, not until a very credible third-party is standing over their shoulder to make sure that they don't have an Avalon hiding under the desk or something of that nature. I wouldn't trust these people at all.

Topic: can anyone explain evaporative cooling system
### Original post:
hi,so im thinking about designing a new bitcoin shed for my farm as a project.i have fell across this farm: <link> they are using a evaporative cooling system to cool there miners and i thought it was a cool idea however had some doubts. The writer describes it as ""durable paper product that looks like the wavy corrugated part on the inside of cardboard. Water is pumped to the top and flows down, and the fans blowing outwards on the other side create negative air pressure, drawing fresh air through the holes and cooling it."" however i don't understand how they do it with all the moisture coming into the farm at night and from the system itself wouldn't it damage the miners? how do the keep the moisture away from the rigs? Can explain this cooling system in more detail? Thanks,Jeppe

### Reply 1:
try this >> <link> It's pretty easy ..

### Reply 2:
But how do they keep the moisture/humidity out from damaging the equipment??

### Reply 3:
<95% humidity isn't a danger to electronics, its only when you start getting fully saturated air that it begins to deposit droplets everywhere.

### Reply 4:
hot surfaces = evaporation.cold surfaces = condensationminers and heatsinks are hot surfaces, so theres no water on them to cause shorts

### Reply 5:
Can anybody explain what is the different between evaporative cooling system as compare to water cooler fan?

### Reply 6:
This reading might be interesting: <link>

### Reply 7:
Evaporative cooling relies on the amount of energy it takes to excite water from a liquid to a gaseous state. If you increase the humidity by say, 10% that means you are actively moving water into a gaseous state. This transition from liquid to gas requires energy, which lowers the temperature of the air.

### Reply 8:
Common PC water cooling systems use a metal radiator to dissipate heat into the air, it's the same as a normal heatsink but you're using water to move the heat away from the source instead metal conduction directly to the dissipation surface.Evaporative cooling makes use of the fact that it takes something like 970BTU to evaporate 1lb of water. If you have a large surface area covered with water and blow a fan over it, you get sensible temperature reduction from the energy taken to evaporate some of the water. It's much more efficient than a normal air conditioner but they don't get used much for air conditioning normally because it dumps a crapload of humidity in the air. Miners don't care so it can be an advantage.Also evaporative cooling effectiveness is inversely proportional to the humidity of the outside air. If it's already humid as shit outside, you don't get much gain with an evaporative cooler. In the desert, they work great

### Reply 9:
We use evaporative cooling on our house , and it use much less power around .75 kw per unit.And as aosmith said, if you have dry air you gain more cooling power.The evaporative cooling system used on that mining farm , is consist of two part the durable paper with continuous water above it and behind it there is a fan that suck the cold air come through that paper.

Which caused some problems at Facebook a few years ago.<link> systems, or simple weather changes on the outside (temperature during day and night, weather moving through) etc can cause problems, especially for power supplies.The Chinese farms have these problems on the large scale, along with dirt and pollution. But of course difficult (for them) to tell if it's just crap quality of components or simple physics at work.

### Reply 14:
Don't bother with evaporative cooling unless you live in an extremely dry environment. It is a very efficient method of cooling only if you don't have high humidity. Otherwise it just raises humidity levels without adding any significant cooling effect.I was very surprised to see evaporative cooling used in that private data center in Thailand that burned down. How did they think that would help with cooling at all?

### Reply 15:
It is because it was very cheap and it didn't take much electricity , and i think they may life in a dry area.

(6 gpus per client)Can I do this or is there another way I shud go about it? The average per gpu jumps around too much for my liking.Thank you.

### Reply 1:
You sure? Highlighted numbers are average per card AFAIK:

### Reply 2:
Yes but mine is constantly jumping around with very large variability . Is yours more stable? Upon further research I see a post where someone has mentioned switching to overclock makes the average more stable (6990) - ill test that out tho I wud prefer to keep it at 375W so I can predict electricity usage. In the meantime the average rate per gpu jumps around so much its ikpossible to gauge whether ur getting a small increase in hashing power.

### Reply 3:
The left figure (458.0) fluctuates a bit, I think its a 5s average; the right one that I highlighted (456.6), doesnt change at all (after running for a while). I think that is the average since starting the app?

Topic: So, how many people are switching away from deepbit?
### Original post:
With all this noise about deepbit controlling 50% or more of total mining power, I've seen a handful of people say that they've moved to other pools. I'd like to get a firm idea of how many people have done so.So, have you moved? If so, where?I had been meaning to experiment with deepbit's PPS model (I started on proportional), but with the controversy I decided to move over to eligius. Fees per share are lower there anyway.

### Reply 1:
I'm in eligus. Wanted to try it out anyway, and the fact that I'm supporting a pool that allows low fees is nice. And the fact that coins show up directly into my wallet is a big plus.I represent about 2gh/s

### Reply 2:
I might switch when my 5830 comes but I've been using deepbit so far.

### Reply 3:
The highest I saw was 548. Seeing as it's down to 526, it looks like the answer is not many.

### Reply 4:
it allows low fees for miners, that's true,but the fact that it doesn't allow ANY free transactions isn't that nice.it forces every bitcoin-user, may it be a miner or not, to pay transaction-fees.do you ever send free transactions?i hope you don't.

### Reply 5:
I took my 1Gh/s over to Eligius, I like getting the payout in block generation.

### Reply 6:
Even beyond the security problem, which is real imo, I don't understand why the miners who bailed out of slush's pool figured they should join the one pool with the highest fee oO""

### Reply 7:
We saw a roughly 15 Gh/s increase at BitcoinPool.com in the past 12 hours. So, a few... I can't account for the other pools.

### Reply 8:
btcmine.com shot up to 74""Eligius"" more than doubled to 40

### Reply 9:
It's understandable. I for one decided it would be best to evenly split up all my miners on various pool. Until now I had all my miners on slush's pool, then when that went down I moved the all to deepbit, but later I realized that with such a huge hash rate deepbit would not be in my best interest due to the very fast rounds. So my solution for now is to split half of the miners on some other pool and as for the others I'm not sure where to place them (still currently on deepbit). I think if everyone did this (distributed their hashing power on multiple pools) it would be better for the network. This way when one huge pool goes down for whatever reason it does not cause a huge and sudden drop in total network hash rate as the users scramble to find alternative pools to hop to. Also a mining proxy may be an even smarter solution. This is something I intend to look into this week.Happy mining everyone!

### Reply 10:
With the current limits used by most miners (including the big pools) no more than about 10 free transactions will ever be put into a block (because the software stops adding them when the block hits 4k) and less if there are also paying transactions. There are only 10 blocks solved an hour (well, more at the moment because the hashrate grew and difficultly will take another day or two to catch up).Some miners appear to be processing blocks without any transactions at all (except the generated transaction to pay them, of course), even though there are with fee transactions pending. (For example: <link> over the long term as the software is currently setup the network will only confirm 60 free transactions per hour. The backlog of free transactions went up to over 1000 several times last week. It only takes a _very_ small fee (0.00004096 BTC) to get included in Eligius blocks. It's pretty reasonable compared to the network's current inability to cope with many free transactions.I talked to Luke-Jr on IRC about the possibility of setting up a free tx fountain to pay miners to process free transactions, he pointed out that the fountain would need to have some heuristic to distinguish <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 11:
You also have to consider variance in the pools themselves. A quick look slush's graphs will show you that even though you'd expect a big pool to give you a steady daily payout, it isn't the case, and you'll good and bad days. Now, if pooling is about reducing variance, then spreading your miners on several pools is definitely the way to go, on top of the fact that it helps secure the network some more, which is the very reason there is a profit to make out of mining.

### Reply 12:
Yep, good point! Thanks for pointing that out. It is now my new policy to spread out my miners as widely as is reasonable. I wish though there were more pools out there. A few more pools, each with a total capacity around 50 Ghash would be a good thing IMHO.

### Reply 13:
Yep, I moved over to eligus.

### Reply 14:
i'm well aware of that and i don't think that miners processing blocks without any transactions at all are any better.it might take just a _very_ small fee, but even a _very_ small fee is a feeand how small it is highly depends on the amount you send and the balance you might (or might not) have left after you<rest of thread truncated>

Topic: Two S2 Antminers on the same network conflict - how to resolve?
### Original post:
I have two S2 Antminers (Bitmain) that I would like to run on the same network. I have set up miner #1 and have gotten it to hash successfully. When I then connect miner #2 with the same settings except for a different IP address (192.168.168.99 for #1 and 192.168.168.98 for #2). To my surprise, #2 can be pinged but it does not hash. I decided to try an experiment to test for some form of network conflict between the two miners as a cause for the failure to hash by #2. I disconnected the successfully hashing miner #1 from the network and I then used the known successful settings from the disconnected #1 to set up #2 which I connected to the network. With #1 disconnected, #2 promptly began hashing. From this I conclude that the reason that I can't get #2 to hash when #1 is connected to the network is because the two miners conflict in some way on the network, causing #2 to fail. Do you have any suggestions for how I can overcome this? To cover our home and outside areas, I have three Apple routers, one base station and two set as bridges. Thank you for any advice you are able to share. Justin

### Reply 1:
The miners will not conflict if they have different static ip addresses assigned to them. The likely cause of the problem is a conflict between something else on your network and the S2 with ip address 192.168.1.98.I've had this happen before, and you will get intermittent connectivity when two devices (not necessarily miners) have the same ip address on your network.

### Reply 2:
This can happen with some routers, when both devices have the same MAC address. Check if they have the same MAC address. If positive, do this:SSH into your S2, thenCode:ifconfig lan0 downmacchanger -r lan0ifconfig lan0 upas I am not familiar with antminers, I hope they have some decent distro installed, which will have the macchanger. If not, you'll have to try to install it.Code:sudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get install macchanger macchanger-gtk

### Reply 3:
Unplug the network for one of your units, log into the unit still connected to the network. Click on Network, when Edit (next to WAN), set the 192.168.1.99 address to a free address (192.168.1.100, etc). Click Save & Apply, you can now plug the other miner into the network and you won't have a conflict.

### Reply 4:
Thank you Cloverme for your suggestion. Your approach solved the problem. Much appreciated.Justin

### Reply 5:
Hi Psahx:I also tried your suggestions and, while the suggestion made by Cloverme solved my problem, studying the approach you outline was a great teaching exercise for me.Thank you for your efforts.Justin

### Reply 6:
Based on your first post, I have assumed you already got different IPs assigned to both of your devices. That is why I have suggested to try to see, if they have the same MAC (it happened to me before, with cloned NICs to have the same MAC).Glad you have got it figured out, anyway

### Reply 7:
So was there actually a device that was trying to use the same IP as the miner? Mobile phone or gaming system maybe?Glad you found a solution fast!

Topic: What about bad pool luck? Or maybe it's something else?
### Original post:
I have been trading a total of about 3TH on mainly Slush and BTC Guild.If you look at BTC pool luck chart for the last couple of weeks you will notice that their 'luck' has been underperformingway more than chance alone would indicate. Do not even care to speculate if there might be funny stuff going on.Slush often has a couple bad or good days in a row but never extreme ranges for extended periods.Any long term miners want to weigh in this with their opinions?

### Reply 1:
Sounds like someone is submitting fake shares on the pool, you should try check yourself by looking at the top 50 hash rate.

### Reply 2:
block witholding ?

### Reply 3:
The bolded part is not true. Do the math yourself or check with Organofcorti. It falls within a normal confidence interval.That being said yeah it's not pleasing. If you flip for who pays lunch and you lose 2 out of 3 times do you say the coin is rigged?There was a known withholding attack that ended a month ago and that messed up the 3 month stats. It is possible that somebody is repeating the attack but it is almost impossible to detect until after the fact.What's funny is that when BTCGuild had very good luck last year people were suspecting they were somehow cheating.If you're not happy you can try Slush or Bitminter. You luck may or not follow, depending on how superstitious you are.

### Reply 4:
BTC 1 month luck is 80%....really not acceptable in my opinion. Can make the diff between making or losing.Well I switched that hash power over to slush alone and my payouts are more in line where they should be.Anybody already come up with the 'optimal' allocation between pools?

### Reply 5:
Again, you are incorrect. Please look at the table correctly. 2 week luck is at 80%. 1 month is at 89%. The pool is now down to 6% of the network. The pool is run by Eleuthria who actually limited/stopped his growth when he got close to 40% just so as not to scare people with 51%. Ghash.IO hasn't bothered to inhibit its growth at all.

### Reply 6:
Thanks for the correction...But even making 20% less than expected for 2 weeks sucks, or does it not? While I am new to mining, I have 20 years experience with a hedge fund. Will talk to our risk management guys about this. I know this much, that we would go through our trade systems with a fine tooth comb if our performance swayed that much.

### Reply 7:
Well yes it sucks, but what can you do other mine somewhere else. You can't get mad you bet on red and the roulette wheel does black 8 times in a row (essentially another pool find more of the 2016 blocks then your pool).You can't eliminate variability. The only issue is whether o not something malicious is occurring at the pool either knowingly or unknowingly. Most pools have gone through this at one point or another. Back when difficulty was 9 million Ozcoin had a block that took 81 million shares, 9 times difficulty!!! That was what caused a lot of people to leave Ozcoin, but the pool still survives despite a theft of almost 1000BTC at one point.Eleuthria has nothing to gain really if his pool has bad luck - he makes more if it has good luck. I'm sure he would love to see the number go back to neutral or above, but you can't will it.Some people will jump onto the pool thinking it has had so much bad luck that it is due for a really good luck streak.

### Reply 8:
There could also be the possibility that there is equipment out there can't actually solve a block now? What proof is there that all equipment is capable of achieving a best share in the billions and all chips and mining equipment is equal? We are told it can? But can it really?If so where's the proof?We are just left with X companies word?Many companies could of very well just made short cuts because no one would be able to prove they did and chalk everything up too luck? sha 256 only uses 128 bit memory bus @ 2^128 which is limited to about 16 Billion as a 32 bit address is just approximately only 4 billion @ 2^32 so it is mathematically impossible for it too use every nonce numbered 1 to 16,800,000,000 at full capacity already it can't use every nonce so a short cut is already made somewhere?.I have read that there is equipment that is unable to use every nonce? This would make sense as a limiting factor?This might be the limiting factor on much of the equipment today? As earlier mining equipment was built with most likely a use of a limited amount of nonce's as it only needed to solve a best share in the millions and not expected billions?This very well can be the deciding fact<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 9:
Is it possible? Yes. Is it likely? No, and the proof is in the math.Now obviously the chips and mining equipment aren't 'equal'. Some will be faster (meaning it can make more attempts per second), some will be more energy efficient (meaning each attempt takes less energy), and some will have fewer hardware errors <rest of thread truncated>

Consider Myetherwallet as an interface to interact with your Ledger nano S. You will still need to enter the PIN to unlock your Ledger or confirm the transactions from the device. The addresses are yours, pre-generated from your seed.

The private-key is inside your Ledger. Putting in a simple way, MEW uses your public key (address) to see your balance and build the transaction, which its sent to the Ledger device, signed with the private-key and sent back to the computer, where its broadcasted. The private-key never leaves the device (reason why you can't see them, and why hardware wallets are so secure compared to normal desktop wallets).

Look at part 3 of that post:3) InstallVery simple install with the Raspberry PI I recieved from BlockC. It was set to DHCP so install was plug and play. I did change it to static IP as I like static with having multiple miners on my network. BlockC sending the Raspberry Pi with a default of DHCP saves you from the install process you did on the 4.1's if you did it yourself. It saved roughly 15 minutes or so and turned install into a breeze.For those who did not get the Raspberry Pi kit from BlockC here is a link to a DHCP Raspberry Pi image. All thanks goes to BlockC for the image. Just use a program such as Win32DiskImager and flash it to your SD card. Then insert SD card into Raspberry PI and you now have a DHCP Avalon 6 controller. Download is below:DHCP RPI Image: <link> the DHCP image that is BlockC's kit image and see if it does you some good.

Topic: Software to Monitor Cloud Hashing?
### Original post:
So i'm looking into selling some cloud hashing power to other friends of mine, but I was curious if there was any software anyone knew of that I could use to monitor the output of my devices (Since I wont have access to look at the miner on the pool of my friend's choice). Obviously I can see the CGMiner window when i'm around the hardware itself. But i'd like to find something that would alert me, hey miner x isn't sending throughput to the specific user. Thanks

Topic: AntMiner R4 Stopped working
### Original post:
my Antminer R4 (Antminer R4, Batch 5(7.5TH/s)) suddenly stopped working after reboot. i tried various options like reset using different methods but i cant get it to workeven the web based admin console was not reachable however afrer several reboots and holding the IP button i was able to connect to web based control panel...however strange problem is that i cant see the miner config screen though i can see other screensi updated firmware using web based console n got success message but still same problem persists...pfa screenshots and kindly advise ...<link>

### Reply 1:
too late you did firmware upgradei can't help you sorry.if you are usa based maybe bitmain warranty can help<link> r4 breaks alot and you muscled a firmware update on a broken r4.your best shot is bitmainwarranty good luck

### Reply 2:
is there a way to connect using ssh....

### Reply 3:
Too late .The r4 is very delicate,They break and break and break.Someone had a link that show how to reset to the original firmware.someone gave it to me it may work if you reset it.I will look for a link to the reset.In I reset it and it still did not work.I sent it in to bitmainwarranty and they did fix it.

### Reply 4:
You can ssh into it with username root and password admin.I doubt the firmware is causing this, at least, if it was installed correctly. I had an R4 controller fail and I replaced it with an S9 controller, flashing it with the R4 firmware and it works fine. If the image was installed properly, and your controller isn't broken, it should be working. Make sure you don't have anything preventing javascript from running on that page.The ""ant_data=;"" you see in the miner configuration page is there because the header has an inline script that begins with Code:echo ""ant_data = ${ant_result};"" The script is fetching cgi data from the config saved in <truncated> For some reason it is failing at that point.

Topic: ISP disconnected my internet because of mining
### Original post:
Ok so here's my issue I live in Manitoba, Canada and realistically there's only 2 ISP's MTS and Shaw. I currently have MTS and a few days ago whilst I had stopped mining due to not having the right setup at the moment to keep everything cool my ISP decided to disconnect my Internet. Seeing as this has never happened before I called MTS. After waiting for an hour and talking to level 2 Tech Support they informed me that my IP address was flagged by their system and was disconnected because their system believed I was performing a DDoS attack. This all happened once i took my miner offline after 3 days of hashing. So my question is are there any ways where I can setup my miner (Antminer S3) so that it doesn't flag my IP as doing a DDoS attack and my lose my internet connection again.

### Reply 1:
I'm fairly certain your IP was flagged for a different reason than mining.Maybe your computer is infected with some kind of malware and is part of a botnet?You can't really be attacking by yourself so it doesn't really make sense to flag your IP.

### Reply 2:
It sounds like you probably had a virus on another system or something else other than your miner. Your miner would never be able to perform a DDoS attack, just like it couldn't surf the Web and watch YouTube videos. They have one specific thing they can do, and that would be mining. I would call them back and ask which computer/system it was and ask if they have any proof at all that it was actually done by you or if it was done remotely.

### Reply 3:
there are only 2 other computers on my network and i have been through each of them with a fine tooth comb i even looked into the other devices like the two cell phones and the KODI box as well as my Pi-Hole and nothing. When i spoke to them about the flag their system analyzes the traffic coming in and going out from my IP and the traffic was consistent with a DDoS attack and further evidence points to the miner because since having the miner disconnected i haven't had my internet cut off. I have changed nothing except disconnect the miner from the network and that has my internet back up and running fine.

### Reply 4:
Guess it's time to speak to customer retention or switch ISPs.

### Reply 5:
ya switching ISP's is not an option i save a bunch of money on my cell bill by having them as my ISP plus Shaw Cable has a limit of 1 TB which i would go over in a flash with the amount of stuff i do on my laptop and on my network in general was more looking for a way that instead of using TCP i can use UDP instead the flagging system only monitors TCP traffic

### Reply 6:
Use a good proxy/VPN/vps and problem solved.

### Reply 7:
any recommendations for a good proxy?

### Reply 8:
I use expressvpn in canada, you can install them on the router.I am also in MB, on mts.At one time I had 30 miners running for a few months.It was not the miner that set them off, could of been a hack, I'd ask for more details, tell them you scanned and fixed anything (say you found something onw ifes pc etc. or some lie so they give up) and they should reactivate you.The mts guys are tools. hate dealing with them, but shaw has data caps....Edit:didn't see post that i was back on.Vpn for sure. likely one of their people being a knob, not even sure you can install malware on a miner lol

### Reply 9:
Just came across thisfigured it may answer your question<link>

### Reply 10:
You should call your isp and ask them for the ip that they thought you were ddosing. If it is not the ip of the pool you were mining on then it was not from mining but probably a virus.

Topic: GUIMiner Problems
### Original post:
Hello friends,I hate to sound like such a newbie...but in fact I am. I have implemented the GUI GUIminer and have connected to Slush's pool mining. The problem is I can't seem to get my video cards into the act. The GUIminer is showing me at 720 MHash/sec but my video cards are showing no load activity or temperature increases.It is almost as though only my CPUs are working. I can't find anywhere in the GUIMiner by ""Kiv"" how to make the video cards get into the game.Does anyone know enough about this to help me?Thanks

### Reply 1:
Well if you are indeed mining at 720Mhash then it is highly unlikely that only your CPU is doing the mining as most CPU's can only mine at around 2-3Mhash.

### Reply 2:
Also mining BTC at this point with anything but asic devices is pointless unless just for learning for a short time.What ""device"" is selected in your drop down window? This is the device that is mining.If you are getting 720Mh/s out of your video card on slush's pool there is a reasonable chance that it can actually be profitable mining scrypt alt coins depending on your power costs, but we need more info.What is your video card?

How many avalons do you have? My calculations show that 2 avalons should be making about 9 coins a day. But that's in perfect world...

Even 2 Bitcoins per day it will only cost you less than 2 months to get the investment back. Don't forgetthe price is still rising and we still have 3 years of current payment of 25 Bitcoin per block.

### Reply 7:
I just don't buy this...no one rationally does that in a commercial concern....they must be mining the crap out th BC before they sell them.[/quote]Avalon ASICs are manufacturing at least 100TH/sec of mining resource. That's a comfortable majority of the network. Confidence drops in the bitcoin network because one entity is in control. The price of bitcoin plummets because no one wants any part of a tainted network. Avalon get thousands of coins worth $0.0000001.From a commercial perspective, those working in the bitcoin currency are sensitive to the public's confidence in the currency. Avalon would be cutting their own throat if they mined with no competition.

if you would have a machine which could produce diamonds the size of a child's head - would you have interest to flood the market with it?

### Reply 9:
Even at 1btc a day mined thats less than 3 months back of the 75btc, even 0.5btc a day is a good deal. Or are you talking about the reward with mining with more than 1 avalon?

### Reply 10:
The thing is that is very difficult to make long-term projections on hashrate, this is why an estimatetion of ""3 months for ROI"" doesn't sounds that good in bitcoin world nowadays, while in the ""fiat"" world a 3 months ROI is an increadible deal.While you wait for batch #3, 2.5 months can pass. 3 months from that other players could be adding THs to the network, and difficulty could just skyrocket.Paying 20BTC for a 65GHs machine you will receive in 2.5 months or less is almost a no-brainer. Paying 75BTC is risky if you are in only for the profits, it's very likely that you will profit much more HOLDING those bitcoins.

### Reply 11:
When we ordered our Batch 1 Avalon in September, we started from an ROI of more than 6 months, as we had to accept that BFL and BAsic will be long on the market. And now here you talking about a risk if the ROI could be 1-3 months! Hello people!

### Reply 12:
Well, BFL could also hit the market in the meanwhile. But I surely doubt it

### Reply 13:
The ones selling the spades during gold rushes makes the most.

### Reply 14:
Bingo. 75BTC is guaranteed money right now for Avalon. It's also about 5x the price of the first batch at current BTC prices.

### Reply 15:
you guys are also assuming profitability based on current prices. If indeed we are in a huge btc bubble and it pops...avy may very well end up making not much / day. Meaning that .5BTC could be nearly worthless =( and that would suck.

### Reply 16:
and yet they are selling AA's for BTCso they don't seem to worried about that.

### Reply 17:
Except this time the gold can't get put into the banks, or confiscated.

### Reply 18:
Well, I bought my Avalon in BTC, and I want a ROI in BTC. I don't give a damn about btc/fiat exchange rate.

### Reply 19:
I am concerned about ASICMINER and their growth to 200 TH. If it is indeed true and so far they seem to be on schedule, the Avalons likely will still break even but the ROI time will be much more uncertain.<link> hope for the end-user sake, the Avalon team can get the machines out faster with the new equipment they're putting in!

### Reply 20:
Don't forget everyone gets hurt when the difficulty goes up but if you have a long enough time horizon, the box should ROI. 12 months is fine if that is what it takes.

He might have sold you an unit which is affected by firmware virus. If he claims that he does not know what is wrong, that is probably because he was in same boat as you.

Ancient history, I suppose that was possible. I do recall the MM flashing not being clean and having to repeat it a couple of times on some of the PIs. Guess I missed that unit when checking.Thanks again.

### Reply 6:
Thanks for catching that. The problem child was the ONLY unit running the older MM. Not sure how it was missed when I upgraded last time.After re-flashing MM, the unit appears to be working fine.RE: Power... I've come to trust the PG ratings displayed on Avalons. Anything other than 15 is a problem that I fix. This unit was 15.

### Reply 7:
Did you flash the pi first and then the MM's?, it might have started one of it's restart loops while the upgrade was in progress. I've never had that happen but I have had the restarts interfere with commands.But glad it's working now.

Either I was too quick on the draw or you have not updated the version string as a fresh git clone tells me I will compile a version 2.9.6.

### Reply 1:
You're right, it wasn't tagged. Tagged now (and be aware it's on the 2.9 branch).

### Reply 2:
The rewrite of how work is gathered into a getwork scheduler is well underway and in the git master tree now undergoing testing. It would not be surprising if it introduces new instability, but I'm hoping for the master branch to be tested and debugged over the next week paving the way for the next version. For what it's worth, it's currently running fine for me. Other goodies including new mmq and ztex code are in there too.

### Reply 3:
Just experienced a crash with cgminer 2.9.7 on Windows. Two miners crashed at the same time. I'm using stratum on BitMinter. Didn't have any crashing problems before with 2.9.x versions, and I saw this on the patch notes:""Windows builds are built and shipped with a new libcurl (and libusb) dll that hopefully improves stability.""Could this be actually causing problems instead of improving stability? If it's possible, I'd be interested in trying out a build with the old dlls.

### Reply 4:
No, likely it's the same windows special crash to do with internet going down which has been there a while. The new dll was there in the hope it fixed this, but obviously it does not. Anyone debugging on windows could you try the instructions and builds in <link> and use the debug build of libcurl dll that's in there as well please. Thanks.

### Reply 5:
I just did a git pull to update cgminer on my rigs, and I noticed that it says I'm running version 2.10.0. Did I time warp to the future?

### Reply 6:
Nope. It's not tagged as such, but it's there to demonstrate the substantially different code base if anyone's running it. That will be the version when it is finally released. Release versions are tagged in git (except when I forget to do it).

Any idea why 2.9.7 seems to crash every 10 hours, while 2.9.6 ran just fine untouched for days? I'm on my normally w7, 4x7970 set up.

### Reply 11:
The only crashes I have seen with 2.9.7 is when a backup stratum pool goes down, back up and then down again. If the backup pool stays down or stays up, it doesn't seem to crash.

### Reply 12:
<Farnsworth>Good news everyone</>Okay after a day of debugging on windows, I found the disconnect crash bug was actually in libcurl itself, which was rather awkward but anyway it means it should get better if you download and use the following dll instead:<link> put it into your cgminer directory, replacing the existing libcurl dll.EDIT: I've repackaged the 2.9.7 release for win32 as 2.9.7-1 including the fixed dll. I urge anyone on windows to update at least the dll. The package is otherwise the same version of cgminer.EDIT2: Bug submitted to curl maintainers so hopefully it will be fixed next version: <link>

New release: Version 2.10.0, 10th December 2012Huge upgrade of lots of code and features, so comes with the usual warnings about potential instability of the new version.Human readable changelog:The main change to this is a completely new work scheduler where all work spawns from. The old work scheduler would spawn threads that all tried to grab work as best as they could, and this would lead to much more work than necessary being grabbed from getwork pools, and potentially hitting the pool at precisely the same time from multiple threads making a getwork failure more likely. It was also very difficult to track how much work was really available at any one time since all the threads were off doing their own thing. Centralising the work creation means it is strictly tracked now and as soon as one work item is taken, the scheduler will generate or download another one. The advantage here is to maximise the amount of work we can get from any source, be it getwork without rolltime, with rolltime, gbt, or stratum, or combinations of the above. It is also much less likely to have dips in providing work, should lead to less getwork failures, and scale to higher hashrates even with the old<rest of post truncated>

Topic: eVGA Supernova 1300 jumper clip
### Original post:
I have a eVGA SuperNova 1300 that I've been using for a while. I had a jumper wire between two pins on the back to allow the unit to turn on.Originally I found a picture that showed where to place the wire. I am searching but can't seem to find the picture or description where to putthe jumper wire. I would appreciate if someone could provide this information so I can get that PSU up and running again.Or if you can simply take a picture of your PSU with the wire in place, that would be great.Thanks in advance,Tom Travis

### Reply 1:
Here are a few sites - <link> and <link> With the EVGA 1300 I believe it's a all black wire if it's like mine so you would need to make sure your looking at motherboard power cord in the right direction. And then count to find the spot as there is no green/black as normal colors.

### Reply 2:
this is not a technical support question. this is a miner support question.belongs here<link> for what pins. the evga 1300 comes with a jumper I will photo the jumper give me a few minutes.note I asked mods to move this.and these photo should be your answer

### Reply 3:
Another useful option is to look for an ""ATX Power Supply Jumper"" on Ebay or Amazon. Yes, it costs more than a paper clip, but makes things so much easier. Less than $5.

### Reply 4:
Still not getting it.... It was simple the first time around.I thought I read something off the eVGA support site that said on the 1300, if you put a jumper in the hole just below the ""V"" in EVGA and also the one to the right..... I am not sure, but it worked before.I do not have a motherboard cable for it and all the pictures show the motherboard end. I want to jump it right at the power supply with no cable.Thanks,Tom

### Reply 5:
Thanks,I got it to work, but 11 & 12 is not what you have in the picture with the clip. Your clip is in position 10 & 11.11 & 12 are one in from the edge (next to other connector), on the clip side, and are Green/PowerOn and Black/Ground.

### Reply 6:
yeah I had an oversize paperclip it popped out 2 times and the last time I got it to stick in I did not realize it was shifted over one hole. It still worked which was impressive.I bent the paper clip better today and shifted it over one. it now works. I am pulling those photos.

Topic: Innosilcon is trying to get rid of heavily used miners
### Original post:
Innosilicon is offering ""manufacturer refurbished"" T3+ and other miners. I ordered a T3+ 57T Bitcoin miner. I had to wait for 4 weeks after I paid in full in Bitcoin until they shipped it out. When it arrived it was in horrible condition: <link> of dust, with scratches, stains, missing screws, rattling parts, rust...The firmware was locked and I was not able to enter my own pool settings. There was plenty of evidence that this miner was not manufacturer refurbished, not even cleaned. Otherwise at least the firmware would have been reset. Innosilicon has 3 departments: while the support is trying to help to unlock the miner, the sales and order team tells me: ""This is what you get when you order from us. Deal with it!""

### Reply 1:
I think other ppl here ordered the refurb T3s. Would be great to have their feedbacks!

### Reply 2:
Yes, please. Who else bought a refurb T3+ ? What was your experience?

### Reply 3:
have you ever got to the bottom of the pool settings being pre-completed and not updating ?also, sorry to hear about your experience, I hope it all goes well in the end

### Reply 4:
Yeah, they use the term refurbished for a miner that was damaged and repaired by them or something returned and they've set it back running. They did warn a bit but you didn't take the warning seriously, usually in those cases light scratches mean run over by an excavator:Sucks and if I were in your place, even if support manages to help you unblock the settings I would play possum and try to get a refund and send it back. I won't be surprised if that thing wouldn't break in a few months, external scratched and missing screws ain't a big deal but you should take a look inside if possible and have a beer nearby when you do

### Reply 5:
Refurbished miners could be a great bargain if you get a diamond in the rough with no issues but that is playing a dangerous game if there is no warranty attached to them. Depending on the price and time to get to you it may pay itself off quickly but if it breaks it could quickly become a paperweight or something that ends u costing what a new unit would plus the downtime to ship it back for repairs. Would love to hear feedback as well from anyone who bought one.

### Reply 6:
Those Innosilicon refurbished miners are 6 months garanty

### Reply 7:
You are right with the firmware lock, but this is a straight-out scam if you ask me, these were supposed to be ""manufacturer refurbished"", the ones in the video don't look anything like it, in fact, REAL refurbished miners are a lot more expensive than clean used miners, a while back used S9js were going for $250 while the refurbished once were going for at least $400, but those looked as good as new, no scratches, no lost screws, everything seemed like brand new, the miner in the video is a Used Miner with C- condition, selling it as a refurbished piece is nothing but scam IMO.

### Reply 8:
Looks like this is a rare problem that has happened before.There are threads about a T2 miner that had it on here.. also one on the russian mining board:<link> might need to do a translate on it with your browser)Post 11 reads:Maybe worth reaching out. Seems they found someone at Inno that can unlock it remotely for you.

Watching some videos from your YouTube channel and I like the soundproofing you have setup. I'd probably be mining with more hashrate at my home if I had such a setup as well. I should also mention that I thought for a second this was a bodybuilding YouTube channel instead of being about Bitcoin mining. From the look of your biceps I thought you might go hulk and crush that thing when it wasn't working.

### Reply 10:
Interesting , they do that constantley , I heard that their ceo is a close friend to the founder of ETH

### Reply 11:
Figured they would carry some sort of limited warranty. That said, considering Inno was made aware of the Fixed Address issue on at least some miners and quickly responded by putting out a fix for it one can't fault them for their response on that part. They also said they were going to issue a mass email to all customers who bought one of the refurbed miners to notify of them of the possible problem and fix for it if they received a miner that was locked. Hopefully the OP just got a miner that had already been shipped just before Inno became aware of the problem and the miner had yet yet been updated to OEM firmwareMy take on things is that the miners are of course from some of the farms in China that got shut down. It makes sense that a farm would use locked firmware to make sure there is (near) zero chance of miners being hijacked either through hacking or actual theft. If stolen, as soon as the miner goes on line Inno will know which miner and what the ip address is.Biggest problem is Inno dropping the ball on making sure the miners are at least cleaned up and along with that definitely reset back<rest of thread truncated>

Topic: Overheat Protection for Antminer S5 50cent cheap, 100% safe and easy to install!
### Original post:
Hi friends,after many months of bitmain's refuse patch a bug which causes fatal overheat to our S5 during internet connection fail I decided to make my own protection independent to miner software and not void our warranty. So again, THIS MOD WILL NOT BREAK YOUR WARRANTY. Just remove this mod before RMA.If you ask how, the answer is super easy - bi-metal thermostat, similar which is used in professional lighting devices, battery packs and many other devices which needs reversible protection fuse. I purchased it from e-bay, for example: 10PCS KSD9700 Bimetal 90 Degrees NC Temperature Control Switch For Transformers<link> pcs for less than 5 bucks with free shipping! You can use any temperature you wish to shut your Antminer down, but it MUST BE ""NC"" version - Normally Closed. This one shutted my S5 at 101C which is still acceptable as critical overheat temperature. This switch will shut down PSU, so NO POWER comes to your S5 until it cools down about 10 minutes, then it power on your S5 back.<link> bimetal switch between heatsinks.<link> not remove the silicon sleeve, it prevents the switch to move out.<link> your paper clip from your PSU and connect the your new bimetal switch on p<rest of post truncated>

This looks like a good solution. 90 degrees between the heatsink is very hot. 80 would be enough imo. Good work!

This is the best hint I've seen.Simple and genious.Thanks!

### Reply 3:
the idea is cheap but to be really sure do two things the op's and Just add a fan as a pullconnect it to your psu for power not the s-5 and leave the stock fan connected to your s-5.<link> cents plus 4 bucks = $ 4.50 a minerpretty much fool proof with the two combined

### Reply 4:
Thanks! The chips survive extreme temperature while running, I had some failed due to internet connection lost and some chips were unsoldered (about 180C at chip package, so die could be 200+). After pressing them back to PCB hash board worked again. That is why I choosed 90C. It is up to one's decision which temp is safe.I think it is very clever idea to remove side panels and check temperature of each chip during operation to make sure all chips are cooled properly. I found some chips are over 100C while S5 shows 55C only. Repasting helped a bit.

### Reply 5:
A Very Helpful method, Thanks mate for sharing.

### Reply 6:
waw great idea man.. it cheap too, thanks for your idea, i will order it.

### Reply 7:
Yes, doubling or quadrupling fans make it yet more fool proof. You can also quadruple fans and each of added connect to separate PSU connected to three different UPS each at different network phase

### Reply 8:
I have an S5 that managed to burn a chip. If bitmain honours their warranty and send me a new one, this will be implemented.This is a reasonable alternative to using aftermarket fans. The issue I see with aftermarket fans is they may not provide the same CFM air transfer as the stock fan unless mounted in some less than conventional configuration, such as 4x fans set up in a contra-rotating fashion (two per end - soldering fun).(see <link>

### Reply 9:
Wow I did not know that such a component existed.Ordering now.... Thanks.Make a new BTC Address (just for privacy issues on your wallet) and post it in your signature and I will make a small contribution.I tested all of my S5's for the overheating due to loss of internet and found some that will.If i disconnect the Cat 5 Cable or Power down my switch/hub then all my miners will eventually stop hashing and will cool.If I just reboot my ISP cable modem then some of my miners will get extremely hot (over 85c) and not Auto Shutdown even though I have ""Stop running when temprerature is over 80"" checked.It is like they think the Pool is still live because the Cat-5 cable is still connected to a live connection (in this case just a switch) but it has nowhere to send the hashes.as soon as the WAN becomes active the S5's start to cool on their own because the hashes are now getting sent to the pool.I was concerned if I ever lost my internet connection for more than a couple of minutes. how many miners would I lose.With this easy solution I am greatly relieved, and cant wait to receive them and install these switches.

### Reply 10:
I prefer my 0 cost method, especially since I want the fans to run at 100% constantly anyway for maximum cooling and maximum lifespan of the S5.

Great idea. I wonder if there's any way to adapt that to use the server power supplies.

Of course you can. Just wire the switch(s) in series with the PSU's control pins and your external on/off switch. If you are using the GekkoScience breakouts for IBM 2 or 2.8kw PSU's the control switch will select either local (just the switch) or external control.

Where or what pool do you mine? Check carefully if you pasted it with extra spaces or letters because the miner will not work properly if the Url has extra spaces or extra letters.Another thing is your internet may be very slow and unstable plus the pool server you use has a high ping.Why not test it with BraiinsOS? If your concern is you don't know to put it back to stock firmware why not just boot the miner with an SD card instead of flashing it directly to the nand?

### Reply 2:
Brainspool as with all my other miners, all pool details are correct,I have messaged seller and he has stated to try hard reset, then upgrade.Also i'll download the file and try the run from SD card.CheersUPDATE 1 -I changed the pool details from older slushpool to newer brainspool and it's working?When i entered the original details i just copy/pasted from a miner already running on older slushpool urls? UPDATE 2 -To run from SD card i presume you still need to move jumper 4?Can someone confirm this please.ThanksI always copy from the same miner out of habit....Very OddAlso where are the details to downgrade from Brains to the older Bitmain FW i have 500, 550, 600, 650 fixed plus variable FW that i used to use and i find some boards will only run on older FW?I can't find the downgrade guide, i presumed flashing BrainsOS would remove the SSH lock and allow you to flash anything?Cheers

### Reply 3:
Why don't you just go check and read the braiins documentation about reverting or flashing it back to factory firmware?Check this link <link> about JP4 if you just want to boot it to braiins without flashing it then you need to download the right firmware there are two options to download, the one is ""auto-install to nand"" and ""Run from SD card"" download the ""Run from SD card"" and paste the contents to SD. And then if you want to boot it don't forget to move the JP4 it is the same as how you flashed the unit before but this time if you move the JP4 to the original position then the miner will boot to the original firmware.

### Reply 4:
Thanks, that's the link i was looking for, i could not find it. I fully understand the process to upgrade via SD card and run from SD card now, plus you have to flash the image not paste to the SD.Even after reading it i'm totally confused as it uses uses command lines etc and SSH? I was hoping to find an explanation for this tbh as once i have done it once i presume i will understand and find it relatively easy and i can help others like you.Even afetr reading how to 'downgrade' and have the old 'Community Edition' FW that i thimnk they now label it i do not understand how to flash it..Thanks for replying and being undertanding, i'm getting there slowly, the tjought of installing BrainsOS seemed complicated at first now i find it simple.Hopefully i can do the same to downgrade and understand how to use these commands and flash back older 'community fw' i have.....

### Reply 5:
You don't need to ""install"" Braiins OS to try it, just run directly from SD, no need to touch NAND ever.You should go with Braiins OS+ which is very simple, you really only need to set up the pool and set a lower power limit value (such as 1280W).With manual values you can easily damage your machine if you are not careful. Defaults should work but for testing you should at least lower the speeds (defaults to 650Mhz). Remember that there is no support with the community edition, you are on your own.Considering you are using Braiins Pool you should go with Braiins OS+, since the 2% pool fee is returned to you when you use Braiins OS+ with it.This won't happen with the Community edition or other firmware, you<rest of thread truncated>

While I can not rule that out, the 33 other machines in the room seem to suggest different. Obviously the board is NOW dirty, cap blew dust everywhere. Guess I need to pull a board tonight.. JOY!!Really I would say the heatsink came loose/ lost contact to that section of the board. Since I was unable to speak to machine had to do a hard reset, the temp of that asic bank was probably reason for machine hanging. Lesson I suppose is after a few months of ops, you should tighten mount points. Now where is my SP10 manual, maybe their website.. HAHAHA LMAO yep ""The best CS and most professionally built"".Might want to shut your SP10's down for a quick inspection!

Ok, so you want to play the part of being an intelligent human being? I got you covered.First, [all!] Electronics fail. Yes, even medical grade electronics that are critical for sustaining a life. (redundant electronics necessary)Second, you seem ""surprised"" because an SP10 caught fire, you therefore seem to consider it an issue of quality.You also stated ""you were lucky"" because you were there to pull the plug. (?) <--I am guessing you aren't properly hosting said device to be worried about burning down the place where you host them.Not taking appropriate precautions is the bigger issue to keep in <truncated> I see your SP10 did fail, (like all electronics from all manufacturers eventually will).The question is, how often do these fail when operated properly.I don't recall seeing many SP10's failing in this board. So I assume they are safe enough.But don't take that as a sense of false relief, instead be prepared for when they do fail.You stated you have ~40 some Ant miners. I am guessing you haven't set those up either in case of a fire in one unit.Again, you don't sound like you are prepared for that <truncated> --> STOP overreacting.There are no hardware from all these manufact<rest of post truncated>

LOL You have an amazing ability to remote view my mind and my data room, WOW!I did not say Thx GOD, because I was afraid something was going to destroy my place. Even it I had let her burn at best it would have caused the building to stink. But hey thx for the free anal-lysis it was really helpful.Likewise I agree shit fails, the difference is will it catch a blaze. I have had several ants fry the difference being they popped, smoked, dead. This SP10, like the AM Turds, caught a blaze which did not extinguish without aid. Thus FIRE STARTER!

Sometimes stating the obvious is necessary.Try not to make a fool of yourself.

### Reply 14:
What on Earth are you saying? How do you even know one thing about my preparedness?

### Reply 15:
I've had two SP10s in my custody for hosting since about July, and this has happened to me three times (twice on one machine). One of them blew a VRM in January when the intake temps were about 14C. That grey bead to the uppper right corner is the only connection between your VRM/bank and the 12V rail, which means if you're worried just remove it and thew hole burnt section is now electrically cut off. Both my SP10s still work at reduced capacity.

### Reply 16:
When we're talking about fire, is it safe to assume that this one self extinguished?

### Reply 17:
Thanks for that HELPFUL comment sidehack, that would be best case to save the remainder of the board's functionality.

Negative, had to pull from rack and extinguish with wet towel. Did not want to over react and kill the room.

Nothing really changed, so try using different firmware. Also, do not hope for PSU. Bitmain will NEVER send you parts on their own even if you beg. You either buy it and hope it is the fix or you RMA it. But before that try firmwares and check visually tomorrow.

First one is odd one. Looks like failed tune. I'd try custom firmware for it.Second one is even odder one. It noticed the second hashboard at start and then after voltage check it just decided to ignore it... Try checking if PSU has good connection with your hashboards and check all the cables, especially the ones that are for data.Also, a little bit of history on units would be useful. Are units new? Did you modify them or clean them in any way? Did you try custom firmwares on those machines? What voltage are you using? I assume it's 220v.

Both new. the first one was a replace from bitmain and the other one from june. I clean them two days ago gently with a painting brush the front part they were working perfect and the error ocurred after electricity was gone like one day ago never custom firmware and voltage always 220.

### Reply 4:
Could be when electricity went down (and maybe up in same time) voltage hurt the PSU. Everything I said still stands. Try custom firmware with underclock and check the cables but if they are new from Bitmain, cables should be placed perfectly. PSU is connected via plates, they should be connected well, and it should be easy to differentiate Data cables and Fan cables. I do not know of any specific video, but you could look into ""teardown of Antminer S17"" or something like that on youtube. Otherwise, you can just start unscrewing screws and make sure you do not forget which go where as there are different ones (take pictures).Or if you are scared to do that, just skip that part and try custom firmware and RMA the units if even that doesn't help, or just RMA right now.Also, it should be obvious, but you should have already tried different PSU cables as well as rebooting miners 2-3 times just to make sure it isn't a bug in software (not that they happen often or ever for that matter).You could also try different power outlets.There is 20+ threads similar to yours which have problems with 17th series, so you can check them for more tips.Also, if you cleaned them gently as you say (with<rest of post truncated>

This thread is for reporting hard numbers of how many mh/s the newest catalyst is taking away from your mining. Please post your card, software, etc, with as many numbers as you have. 11.11 and 11.2 Catalyst both steal mining speed and may or may not fix the 100% cpu bug.

I'll confirm from past experience that anything past 10 aggression causes high CPU, but only on single card setups. Multicard setups have cpu bug no matter what for me. People say cpu bug is gone on the very newest AMD APP 2.6 + OpenCL 1.2 + Catalyst 11.12/12.1, but I can't justify the huge hash speed loss over maybe 10-15 watts since I'm already hugely underclocking my cpu from 2.4ghz to 800mhz.Gaming PC - Sapphire 5830 Xtreme - 950/1125 24/7 - Mine off and on depending on gaming activities, about 295 mhash when not using PC @ aggression 5.

Currently ~315/~480/501mhash @ aggression 14. CPU bug persist across all aggressions.

### Reply 2:
I'm running 11.12 but regressed to SDK 2.4 and I'm running at full speed on my dual GPU 5970. But with the latest and greatest SDK (whatever came with 11.12) I was down about 50 MH/s per core. If you want to try going back to an earlier SDK, you might want to try deleting the following files <truncated> some reason these files aren't removed if you do a complete ATI uninstall (at least for me they weren't).

### Reply 3:
Thank you to Mousepotato for providing the list of files to remove before downgrading the OpenCL runtime. Previous attempts at reverting had failed to recover lost performance.I've now regained ~20MH/s on a 5850 and ~10MH/s per 5830.Edit:I'd forgotten that I'd switched to the phatk kernel since it seemed to perform better with 11.12's OpenCL runtime version. Switching back to phatk2 with the 2.4 runtime yields +5 MH/s/card.

Be careful I tried to check their few pages it seems that their website is not finished yet there are some pages that do not have content and after checking the source code of the website they are using CMS WordPress. And most of the product they sell looks like used units that do not exist. They are also selling Innosilicon units which don't have any support anymore.So there is a high chance that this website is scam.If you are looking for cheap units why not buy directly from Canaan they have pretty cheap units with the same hash rate.

Good to know. This mod makes the S1s theoretically cheaper per Ghash than the S2 without sacrificing much power consumption.

### Reply 8:
According to Jim above's volt mod experience S2 are still much better for power consumption for not much more BTC which i foresee batch 3 to be priced around $3000.1000gh / 165 = 6.061 x 277 wall watts = 1678 watts6.061 x S1's = 5.41 BTCNow add the cost of all the power supplies needed for 6 x S1's and the S2 batch 3 will clearly be the smarter option by far.

Is there any way to connect that board to RPi or even to existing and working S1 ?Thank you very much

there may be a way to connect it to an upcoming S2 unit if they simply modified the voltage/clocks on the current blade design.

Yeah, i cant think of anyway that you could connect it to an S1. AFAIK neither:a) cgminer settings are capable of detecting more than 2 boardsb) 2 cards cannot share a dataline for double hashrate. you would either see a lot of duplicate throwaways or HW errors. I do not think it is a 'shared comms' type of connection where multiple boards in parallel would be capable of sharing instructions or hashing 'n-times' faster

Has nobody overclocked or overvolted an S2 yet?640 chips (an S1 has 64 chips), 16 chips per TPS53355 regulator (S1 has 8 per)S1 was forcing around 30A through the regulator at stock speeds, and up to 40A with overclocking and some overvolting (based on some of the 210GH+ reports in this thread)S2 is putting about 22-24A on the regulator at stock. Presumably with a bit of voltage modding and overclocking the regulators could handle up to about 1.4TH/2kWonly issues:1) power. To seriously overclock, adding a 600W+ PSU will be necessary2) cooling. More fans and/or individual chip heatsinks are necessary to properly exhaust any extra heat since the units read 50C+ temperatures stock2b) PCI entenders. Looks like the boards are all mounted using PCI (PCIe 16x?) slots. if you used some risers (with a nice pair of 14AWG power cables to protect the risers) you could get the boards up out of the case and arrange them with airflow directly aimed at the heatsinks for better cooling.I can't wait for my batch 2 unit to arrive - if noone overclocks by then I might have to be the first. (donations will be accepted in case i kill my miner :p)

I have undervolted my Antminer to 1,0V (R3 = 3.9kOhm) and I am really happy with results. Before mod my antminer was consuming 348W on the wall on 180GH/s but now it takes only 260W on 165GH/s.So 8,3% performance decrease means 25.3% power input decrease. Nice I am running about hour now and no HW errors at all. I also tried 180GH/s with lowered voltage, but a lot of HW errors resulted in 170GH/s output performance too.Mod was really easy. 10 minutes of work and everything worked on the first try.Thanks for the guide.

### Reply 17:
What are the risks of undervolting?I don't know the physics of it, so please excuse my ignorance 1. If I undervolt but do not underclock, what will happen? Will HW errors simply increase, or do I risk the antminer<rest of thread truncated>

Topic:  How to solve ""Pool 0 not providing work fast enough"" when Solo mining ?
### Original post:
In CGMiner you can increase your ST (Staged Work) by increasing your queue by going to settings and then queue and increase it from the default of 1 to 90 or so. That will help. Also setup some backup pools so that when Bitcoin-QT doesn't supply work fast enough you miner can leak some shares to standard pools. That way it's not a complete loss.Also the only share you will see submitted to the solo will be block solves. So not seeing any accepted shares is normal operation for solo mining.Sam

### Reply 1:
Hi Sam,I increase cgminer queue to the maximum 90, then the message is gone. Is it necessary to tuning its work queue as minimum or I can use queue with 90 without the effect? Do you have any command recommend to add more in bitcoin.conf to increase luck or performance?

### Reply 2:
I don't use the .conf file myself. I use ""-Q 10"" command line switch then manually increase it when I start the miner. The .conf file may allow larger values then the command line.As for tuning, I don't know how much difference other values will make. I use a queue of 60 to 120 as seems to vary how busy it keeps my BE's. You have allot more hashrate than I do with my meager 20GHs or so.Just make sure your client has as many connections as possible.Good Luck,Sam

### Reply 3:
Hi Sam,I got the message again in next 10 minutes but the message occurred quite slower than using its default queue. That it means my bitcoin-qt reaches its capacities in the current environment, I have to set up backup pool follow your recommended.I don't know the other persons face this problem like me that using bitcoin client on Windows7 Virtual machine. Is it not generate the issue incase not using Virtual machine or using other OS? Anyone can confirm that solo mining is working normally on Windows7 when having hashing load at 140GH/s up?Note: Currently, I only have Macbook Pro with small hard disk so it needs to use VMware in case.ThanksPaulK

### Reply 4:
What many people do who solo mine with high hash rates it so setup their own pool software. That's more complex than I want to get. So I just mine with the occasional ""Pool 0 not providing work fast enough"" message and not worry too much about it. And setup failover pools to take up the slack. I'm happy with that. Of course I would be happier with finding a block, but hey, can't have everything I guess .Sam

Topic: Antminer S3 missing Chain
### Original post:
I had 2 chains showing before, but one of them had only xxxx for the ASIC status. I went ahead and rebooted the machine to see if it would resolve any issues. Initially, I had overclocked to 250M. I think that may have had an adverse affect. My PSU is 850W, so it should be plenty. Anything I can do to get that other chain back? Right now, I'm mining at HALF the rate I should be.Any thoughts or help?Thanks

Resetting your machine, might will be your solution, since the antminer s3 have a resetting button. but am not sure if that button can bring back your clock setting to default. good luck

### Reply 1:
Download the latest cgminer, your cgminer is very old.You need to use powered usb hub(a good one) since it's draw more power. Of course even if you can draw 336MH, you won't get any share with today difficulty.

### Reply 2:
Version 3.2.1 is actually new enough to run the block erupter. The problem zich has is that he probably has not installed the drivers for his miner to work:<link> this, your computer cannot 'talk' to your miner properly.

### Reply 3:
There's not much point advising him how to use an old version which uses different drivers to the current version and is riddled with bugs long since fixed in the newer versions.

### Reply 4:
I wasn't advising him to use the old version. I was saying that his old version is likely not the problem--it is his lack of drivers which is the problem.I am certain that all versions of cgminer require the silabs driver for the erupter to function--I was using a new version of bfgminer with my block erupter back in the day and I required the driver before it would work.In short, him upgrading cgminer will not address the root cause of his issue. It may be more stable/have less bugs (and be a good idea), but he still requires the same driver.

### Reply 5:
AFAIK bfgminer uses a different driver. Need to use zadig for cgminer to change to WinUSB.

### Reply 6:
Give the new drivers ago as others have suggested, if that does not work let us now. It is a good idea however to update your cgminer.

Topic: Antminer S9 running 2/3
### Original post:
Hi,This is a brand new Antiminer S9 (my first attempt at mining). Can someone help me figure out why it is only running 2/3?<link>

### Reply 1:
Chain 6 is missing chips, see how it has less o's than the others? Each o is a chip that is reporting OK, they are all linked in a chain. For some reason, a chip is bad in your chain 6 and preventing the others below it from working.You could try powering down and switching around the ribbon cables, but this seems like a hardware defect that you need to report to bitmain. Sorry.

### Reply 2:
Thank you. I have already contacted Bitmain (no reply). I was hoping there was something I was overlooking.

### Reply 3:
I say limp along at 11GH and get a few hundred bucks while you wait for bitmain. Send them the screenshot and kernel log, and ask if you can open the front fan and cover and send them back only the bad board. This will break the front warranty sticker, so you must get their permission. But at least you could keep mining at 9-ish GH while you wait for the board to be returned and replaced. The ant won't care if it comes up with only two boards, it will still mine them. But of course, power down before disconnecting anything or opening 'er up.Slushpool - nice!

### Reply 4:
I was hoping that could be worked out. The FAQ says the whole S9 needs to be returned, but it doesn't make sense to do so (to me).Running on the 2 boards, I'm getting 9.2GHI'm jumping in with both feet. I have another S9 coming Dec 27-Jan2, Three L3+ this week, and I'm waiting on half the parts to build three ( 8 ) GTX 1070 rigs.Thanks again for the advice.

Topic: single BFL chip USB Miner idea
### Original post:
Doesn't a single BFL chip still draw more power than two USB ports combined (bus powered)? I think a Jalapeno with 2 chips draws like 30w and 2 USB ports is only 5w of power.

### Reply 1:
Each BFL chip draws about 14watts in the Jalapeno, as several people have measured.So you would need 6 USB ports to run one chip.

### Reply 2:
OK, so it's a dumb idea... nevermind.what about other interfaces, do any deliver required power for a single chip? POE? firewire maybe? I hate external power supplies...

### Reply 3:
dumb idea from a dumb weak as person

### Reply 4:
Not at all a dumb idea. The jalapeos are still using first gen chips, 2 of them and a PCB build for originally up to 8 chips.According to the power spec for the new chips is a power consumption of 3.2 w per GH. This may not be 'USB only' territory but I think a small 1-chip design could still be an interesting proposition for 4 gh/s single chip miners.

Topic: [Review/My Experience]With Bitmain's Second Hand (Used) Antminer S5 Batch 7
### Original post:
Is that a bad thing? You can work that out by asking the following questions:1) When was the last time you heard of an S5 damaged in transit?2) When was the last time you heard of a Tube / Prisma damaged in transit? [A miner that used copious packaging].3) Do you like paying to ship unneeded packaging materials around the world?4) Do you want all the baby penguins to die?

### Reply 1:
Yeah I think the s5 is normally shipped only with 2 white foam pieces.. well also with the bubble wrap bag but with these second hand units i can see why they dont include the bubble wrap.. probably just packaging them up on the fly really quick

### Reply 2:
That's up to the next buyer to decide. For me, personally the different units i have came in smaller/tigher boxes with the unit in an anti-static bag. Overall there's less packaging material. The sides are have a small layer of foam which serve arguable purpose beside balancing the pressure if the unit get thrown or dropped. Doesn't sound particularly overkill to me and it is better packaging and less material weight, while the extremities get the same absorption rate.Is that a bad thing? Probably not. Was the packaging i received very barebone? Yes. Would i have preferred a tighter and better packaging? Yes.Mhm. That is how it went. I do hope we get those coupons toward some other product down the road. It would make me fully satisfied, since ultimately i did pay full price for a slightly used unit, but used nontheless.

### Reply 3:
I really care about baby penguins and polar bears.Bitmain is a good company.About the used miners, every miner by every manufacturer are in use till they are delivered to the last user.30 day warranty is actually working and I feel comfortable to buy products from Bitmain.

### Reply 4:
Its not too bad its been running pretty well now. I did some longer tests pushing real OC on the machine till the machine no longer operate properly;

### Reply 5:
Of the 5 I've gotten, that's how 4 of them showed up. One had peanuts and some antistatic foam and was in a plastic bag, but that one I bought via Amazon used not from Bitmain.The ""30 days starts when the units are shipped"" part is actually illegal under US law - US code specifies that warrenttees start when the buyer recieves the item (I've BEEN to court once over that and WON, it's in the US Code somewhere) but for practical purposes it's not a significant issue given that Bitmain seems to get stuff out promptly once they claim it's shipped - 2 to 3 day difference that most folks would never notice.Just be sure if you DO have a warenttee claim that you get it filed promptly - once the claim is FILED there in no specific time limit on resolution.I suspect the coupons aren't going to be particularly large amount. I'd bet on $50 or less - which is still better than nothing when they FINALLY start selling S7s.

### Reply 6:
I won't spit on 50~$ and worse case scenario i can probably sell them to an user if i can't afford the next gen unit. Regardless. I look forward to it.I'm thinking of opening a ticket with Bitmain about the instability of board one. Overall its not a big hash loss but if its precursor to more severe issue, then that would really bother me ^_^"".If its a stable issue that wont degrade, i don't mind too much. Its a big hash rate loss when it happen, but in the last 3 days it only happened once. It would definitively be a loss to ship it back or something no matter what.Other than that, since my later tests that i didn't report, 393.75 is the best Freq. You can get 5 more GH~ at 400 but you start getting over <0.0001% errors and ultimately you get like 5 gh for 9watt~ of power.

### Reply 7:
So two days ago, the Used Antminer S5 Batch 7 from Bitmain finally arrived. Me and several user were previously discussing the condition and value of buying used hardware for the full price. So this is for the few who asked question such as ""Second Hand S5, Is it worth?"" This will be a pseudo review on specifically the Used batch 7 Antminer S5 bought directly from Bitmain;So the packaged arrived in the usual box it always does. I quickly opened it and found some very minimal packaging. No need to include a picture, it was simply 2 white foam square holding the extremities, with no other kind of padding or packaging whatsoever.The unit was fairly dusty and there was clumps of dust in the heatsink. Hmm well, a bit of pressured air and as new. Or not quite, but i guess its not that bad.2 Minutes later i finished placing it, plugging it and logging into the interface and replacing the Bitmain's worker info with Kanopool. Then flashed to Bitmain's latest firmware.My first impression was Great, the open wrt Luci is very responsive (My S1 are hella slow).I then first tested a few things, the 2 most important point i must bring;-Fan control works, you set a %, no value seem to default to 8<<rest of thread truncated>

Greetings.I'm getting for my 2 USB Gizmos, 336.4 to 336.8 MHash/s, also with active cooling, 1% Hardware Errors. The ASIC chip needs a heatsink and the best I saw (and going to buy from Taiwan in a few days) is the smaller of a 3 heatsink kit to the Raspberry Pi, intended for the voltage regulator of the RPI: <link> If anyone knows a better one, please post here.

### Reply 3:
I believe the heatsink that's on it is glued to it so be careful you don't wreck the chip removing the old one

### Reply 4:
If you are talking about the USB block eruptor, the heatsink is on the backside and it falls off when unscrewed.The thermal pad is not sticky.

### Reply 5:
With a fan on mine, they are averaging ~354MH/s each. It does fluctuate quite a bit, but that is the average.

### Reply 6:
How are you getting 354? Any modifications?Also is it better to take of that heatsink? I Have two of them and for now they are with heatsink on with 120mm fan blowing on them, all i can say that they dont get so hot like without fan, exact temps cant tell, but without fan it was 66 C, now its a lot cooler, but i still get ~ 1.9% HW.

### Reply 7:
I dont think active cooling is neccessary. I got three Erupters and I found out that a passive chipset-cooler attached to the initial cooler along with this thermal-pad does a great job. Got a picture from my setup here:Soon each Erupter will get bis own chipset cooler.

### Reply 8:
The idea is to keep the original gracious heatsink with the BTC logo at the bottom side and glue the aluminium heatsink directly on the ASIC ""BE100"" chip with the included 3M Self Adhesive Thermal Layer, at the upper side.

### Reply 9:
My BTCGuild estimated speed is 1,760.94 MH/s for 5 units, which works out to ~352MH/s each. I've also got a fan on mine.

Topic: Looking for S19 Test Fixtures
### Original post:
I previously owned a test jig for the S9 and it worked for the Antminer S9 and some 17 series hash boards. But recently it has rested. I want to buy a new jig and I want to be able to use it on the S19. No suitable ones have been found so far. I was wondering what do you use to test 19 series hash board?

### Reply 1:
I already give you a link from your previous threads you should also notice the test fixture from ZeusBTC but if you don't know yet then check this Antminer universal chip fixture test fixture.This support almost all Antminer units to test hashboard. And if you still asking for something related to repairing all you need is already on ZeusBTC so learn how to use the search button from their website.

### Reply 2:
Yes buy the fixture from Zeus just dont buy the touchscreen model, its a hot mess. You can also fix Your test fixture with one of Zeuss generic S11/15/17 Zynq boards.

### Reply 3:
Thanks for the reply. I did notice this test fixture from ZEUS before, but I only saw its introduction picture was no marked S19, so it was ignored at the time.Entering from this link, I see that S19 is mentioned in the introduction. Thanks for the reminder.

### Reply 4:
Does touch screen model mean ""2022 new version Antminer test fixture with touch screen""? Why is it mess? I'm thinking of buying the generic or this new version, can you speak more clear? I want to know. thanks.

### Reply 5:
My first one broke on the first day and the screen never scrolls to the last few lines, you constantly have to be touching it to see the final output. I fixed mine with a generic S17 board from them. The convenience of portability is negated by the quirks. Its just a mess but it is completely functional. The one pro I will add about this machine is it has a dedicated board inside that takes ATX power and runs pt2 test fans.

### Reply 6:
Thanks for your reply. This helped me, I think I'll buy a generic test fixture to use first and keep watching this.

### Original post:
I have a question about one (1.0) share mined with clevermining.com bitcoin pool. Several million hashes were calculated at difficulty 1,024. How much is that worth in terms of the bitcoin pool? And when does payout occur? Is it weekly or minimum threshold. Also, they are giving me an error indication user not found and I was mining to my own bitcoin wallet address. Anyone else use this mining pool? I need some advice.

Topic: I just realized why I need to start mining, so a question for miners
### Original post:
The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes.The importance of the above quote struck me last night. So I want to throw in my .02 btc of being an honest node and add some hashing power. I'm not worried about spending a few more dollars on electricity than I make in bitcoins because Bitcoin has already treated me so well.I mined on my laptop back in the day but stopped when it went to GPUs. Now, looking at mining has the same effect on me as the first time I encountered Bitcoin itself. It's confusing for us non-miners. So perhaps an expert or two could help clear up the confusion.My question: What's the lowest impact, cheapest method of adding 1-2 gigahashes/s to the network? As said, this is just to be an honest node as I'm not worried about profit from mining.Thanks!

### Reply 1:
The ""being an honest node"" argument with just 1-2GH/s is moot, because with such a low hashrate you're probably going to mine on a pool anyways. In that case it's not you, but the pool-operator who has to be honest (and you don't really have any control about that).But to answer your question: the cheapest way in terms of initial investment is probably to grab some used ATI GPUs on ebay, although the energy-cost is quite high for the long term. Another way would be to grab some used FPGA boards, higher initial investment, lower energy-costs. Or just wait a few more months and hope for ASICs to be <truncated> that's about all methods around for everybody.

### Reply 2:
So it would serve my interests to do my research first into who's running the pool. And that's what I wanted to know. Thanks for the quick answers.

### Reply 3:
Good for you for realizing the importance of why Bitcoin is so important. Impartiality.So, now, with the right philosophic point of view, go get yourself some ASIC's.

### Reply 4:
Where can we get some? Butterfly labs seems to be DOA and Avalon is sold out.

### Reply 5:
Yeah this is what I'm waiting for. It's OK if I miss the gold rush but will definitely want something simple hashing in the background at low cost once the technology matures a bit. I'd bet plenty others are in the same boat.

### Reply 6:
I'd want a simple small device that I can plug into my computer's USB port and starting bitcoin mining at 10 GH/s or 20 GH/s. When there are about a few hundred of us little folks doing that, we'd help secure the network. Fees can also be lowered.

### Reply 7:
Use P2Pool, and then you're an honest to god honest node.Or really, if your motivation is primarily to secure Bitcoin feel free to solo mine. Your expected return is as good or better, and if you're not in it for the income the fact that its a bit of a lottery shouldn't turn you off.

### Reply 1:
We're designing X-3 to be rackable so we can easily fit it into the data centers but you can certainly use it in your own home.Thank you for the very good question and we're sorry to have created this confusion. We will correct our description soon.

Chips and systems out at end of Feb 2014 - that means tape out sometime in December 2013, which means you've only just, or have not yet started physical design. Without being well into the physical design stage how do you know what your power or performance numbers are going to be with any confidence?

### Reply 3:
We've started the design in June. The only difference between us and our competitors is that we do not give unrealistic time frames which we know we cannot meet. We are confident that we will deliver sooner but we do not make promises that we might not be able to fulfill.

### Reply 4:
I love the prices but 64gh/s (the only one I have bitcoins for) isn't going to make any ROI in feb 2014.

We do not think this is correct. We already replied to this here.

### Reply 6:
I do hope you're right.

### Reply 7:
I am interested,Any guarantee to be delivered during Feb-14?TMC

### Reply 8:
If you are guaranteeing prices then what's the point of preorders? Basically the people preordering now are giving you a free loan because come february everyone gets the same price anyways. The only benefit of preordering now is if the buyer thinks that you won't have to lower prices and the current price will end up being less then market prices for similar devices at the time of shipping.

### Reply 9:
Its not shocking their ""artist impression"" would use some 3rd party case.While I have no experience with them myself, if you look around you will see that Black Arrow is a real company with a sterling reputation for bringing to market FPGA based miners. I dont see any reason to assume this would be a scam.

### Reply 10:
hican you give more details about your fab ?type of asic etc?

### Reply 11:
After a whole year of this ASIC preordering phenomenon/fiasco somehow you've managed to miss the point, lol.Preordering gives these small companies the needed capital to develop ASIC devices. In return, the ""investor"" is rewarded with a place in line when the device finally ships.Right or wrong, it's pretty much the only game in town. If you are waiting for the time when things ship the same day that you place your order, you may be waiting a very long time... unless you're content with ASICMiner Blades and USB Erupters.

### Reply 12:
Another pre-order in stock product ?No thanks

### Reply 13:
Let's see.X-1:$239 / 64 GH/s = 3.73Not $1.99 per GH/s.X-3:$3999 / 1344 GH/s = 2.97 (1344 is from the specification; X-3 should have 21 ASICs 64 GH/s each)Still not $1.99.Chips:$169 / 64 GH/s = 2.64But there is a discount:$2.97 - 30% = 2.079 (2.0828 exactly, but quite close)$.64 - 30% = 1.85However counting the discount is not fair. One would say BFL Single SC 60 GH/s was $699 because of FPGA upgrade.Where Black Arrow took the $1.99/GH/s from?

### Reply 14:
After a whole year of this ASIC preordering phenomenon/fiasco somehow it's starting to feel like the companies will promise you anything and everything just to get your money. Even if it makes no sense. What's the point of them getting capital now if they guarantee to drop the prices to whatever the market price will be in the future and have to return most of that capital? I don't mind gambling but when the gamble is just some vague guarantee promise that isn't rooted in reality that's just one more hurdle to overcome besides the fact of sending non refundable to btc to some outfit in china and hoping for the best on a proposition that's many months away.

### Reply 15:
Customers who pre-order and pay now have 25% discount. Our promise is that we will ensure that customers who preorder now will always get a better deal than customers who order later.At the same time we promise that our prices will be below market price at the time we ship. This means that customers that preorder now will have considerable lower market prices by the time that we ship which puts them in advantage towards anybody else.Unless Bitcoin mining stops because it becomes unprofitable for everybody else in February, our customers WILL make profit.

Orders of over 10000 pcs of Minion ASIC are $127.36/pcs$127.36 / 64 = $1.99

Everybody until now sold you hardware that they knew that you're going to loose money because 1 month later they announced something faster at a better price.We are guaranteeing that this won't happen with us: If we drop the price you'll get even faster hardware, keeping you in front of everybody else.

### Reply 8:
Just so you know, USB works on 5v, not 12v. If your USB hub's power brick is rated for 12 volts, it is because your USB hub has internal power circuitry that brings the 12v down to 5v. If you connect a 12v power source to a hub that does not have this circuitry, you will fry everything, including the USB port on your motherboard since the power 12v power will backlash into the 5v and ruin everything.

No fix yet, at least for me.

Does 11.7 preview still hangs up on a 6950 if you launch a video while mining?

### Reply 7:
yes and no i forgot to turn off my miner the other day and went to watch a movie and my pc dint lock up then i tried it 5 more times and it locked up every time so mabay we are moving in the right direction or it was just a fluke idk. but in the mean time turn of gpu gpu acceleration it fixes it

### Reply 8:
Does the 69xx mem downclock work properly yet? (I mean downclocking more than 100 MHz below core) Anyone that's tried it, I'd love to know - need to cool those 6990s!

### Reply 9:
11.7 Early + SDK 2.5 = ~755 MH/s compared to ~740 with 11.6 + SDK 2.4... (2x 6970s @ 880/170 [mem downclocked with MSI Afterburner after disabling EULA] ...also disabled ULPS)

### Reply 10:
Mine seem to downclock well using Sapphire Trixx.Going from 11.6 to 11.7 gave my 6990 a boost from ~360 to ~374. Nice.No change on 5870s.

### Reply 11:
So, looks like everyone's reporting a small bump on the 6 series cards, but nothing on the 5 series cards?

### Reply 12:
Under 11.5 I've thought I've downclocked mem before, but I noticed that temps were increasing instead of decreasing. When I used some cli tools I found that the mem clock reset to max if I set to more than about 100MHz less than core. Have you noticed a temperature reduction after downclocking mem? What did you downclock them to? This could be awesome - no more fans as loud as hairdryers for my SO to complain about!

### Reply 13:
I just killed my PC with a 6450 upgrading to 11.7. Went to safe mode and changed driver back to 11.6 and now can't even get into Windows. Safe mode hangs on storport.sys (how is this even related??) and Startup Repair from the OS drive hangs on a blank screen while Startup Repair from Windows 7 DVD hangs on Starting Windows with no logo.And, starting Windows 7 setup from DVD also hangs...hardware failure?

### Reply 14:
what happens if you remove the card then boot up?

### Reply 15:
Same. Actually, I just got it to boot. Weirdly in my bios the CPU was undervolted by 0.3v. But the PC has been working fine for 2+ years (6450 is a recent addition). I had pulled out the 6450 and the eSATA pci-e card because of the hang on storport.sys but still could not get past the Windows boot up logo. The integrated graphics was also ATI/AMD so it would loud the same driver - I thought I was screwed. As a last resort I decided to reset the bios (this MB has always been finicky) and noticed the 0.3v undervolt! I wonder if this was usable before (can't remember) and just now at this point in time stopped working or somehow the bios got corrupted (seems so unlikely?).I'm reinstalling 11.7 now to see if the CPU voltage setting was the culprit.Anddd...the PC froze during setup.Reinstalled 11.7 again without display driver and got BSOD..and here's the kicker, my CPU is once again undervolted 0.3v in bios. So now I have some software that can change my bios settings O.O

### Reply 16:
wtf? thats not posible, only with MB that has UEFI...

### Reply 17:
I don't have UEFI. I know it's possible to make real time changes to certain chipset flags but none that persist in the BIOS EEPROM. The undervolting may just be a quirk of the MB from all the hanging and BSODing...it's a weird MB. The system has otherwise been stable since I've put it together.I have tried installing 1. complete 11.7 package, 2. 11.7 without display driver, 3. 11.7 with just display driver, app sdk, and VISION engine. All 3 has same problem - I'm suspecting the VISION engine setup now so going to try it without that.Update: Confirmed the instability is from the VISION Engine. Maybe it doesn't have the correct clock profile for my 6450 and thus runs it at unstable settings. Don't have an explanation for the BIOS undervolting except that the MB is quirky.

What you should try is to set a lower maximum power target. Fir example 1300 Watts maximum. The issue is that Brains OS + does often put to much watts from the beginning. If you get good results with 1300 watts you can try to set higher wattages.If that does not work post again the error codes.

I resoldered the elbow joints on the original connectors, it immediately shot up to 16TH.Is it possible oxidisation of the metal causes the connectors to not transmit current correctly to power the miner?

### Reply 8:
Yes that is totally possible! You can measure if the voltage is correct/if the is a current. If everything works now then I would just leave it however. So this means that your broken control board is now working again fine?

How much current does your power adapter deliver? The USB eruptors require 500mA each. The DUB-H7 can deliver 3A, which is 5 eruptors and 1 fan, or 6 eruptors.

I'm interested because I'm moving into a data center 2h away and I don't want these supplies to crap out as soon as I get halfway home, lol.If you have a voltmeter, I would check the voltage at the power supply's screw terminals as the miner ramps up. Use this miner that limps along, not the other miners that just hammer the supply and stop mining.There is a blue adjustment pot in mine, but messing with it could be dangerous if you don't have a voltmeter to make sure you are not exceeding the s9 spec.

Am I missing something, or is this really just a power button for an ATX Power supply and a Raspberry Pi? How much does it cost, and can you really justify it over something like this?<link> just did a random check, and it seems a bare Arduino board with no accessories runs $30. Add another $10 or so for the other components, and you effectively have a $40 power switch for your $50 Pi. I can see some value if you're making a sealed, plug-and-play miner that you will hand off to someone else (or sell on eBay at an insane markup), but I think for most folks, the breakout board above (or heck, a bent paperclip!) would be more cost effective.

### Reply 19:
You aren't missing anything except the fact that it also talks to your Pi and halts it when you want to power off. I'm not even that interested in selling anything. I started a Tindie campaign just to gauge interest, if people like the design and want to source their own they are free to do so by visiting <link> a cheaper board suits you better than by all means use it, I thought there was value in the idea so I produced and shared it.

Very nice product! One thing the Youtube video didn't mention: Can it support <truncated> I'd like it to automatically power up if it freezes and I power-cycle the PSU. Also, are you selling for BTC?

### Reply 21:
Like I said, it has merit in specific use cases, but in general, it may not be cost-effective. If you can add some functionality to it beyond just a power button, it would be more viable. A couple of ideas come to mind. First, software integration with the Pi so that you could control multiple individual miners and power-cycle a stuck one, or turn on additional miners at set times, when power may be cheaper. Also, Crazyates mentioned auto-power-on; that got me thinking that it would be nice to automatically power on the system as soon as the power supply is plugged in, so that if power goes out in your area, you wouldn't have to do anything to start up your miners after power is restored.Side note, I went looking for a cheaper alternative to that breakout board ($9 each, plus about $10 to ship), and I found this item on eBay. Functional, but certainly not elegant. The guy sells them for $5.50 each, or five for $19, with free shipping in the US.

Easy, you can mine or send btc to cex.io to purchase their gh/s that in turns mines for you, cloud mining.Also you can sell the gh/s you buy from them for btc as well, its a commodity market.Icon

Im looking on their site and I dont understand this part (tell me where I am going wrong)An example realtime price is .082 BTC for each GHS. Lets say I want to go big and get 1TH/s which is 82BTC. At this point is where I get lost...How long will they hash at 1TH/s for me? Until infinity? The reason I ask is that at a rate of 700USD/BTC it will take over a year to become profitable according to <link> conclusion is the people willing to go this route are gambling on BTC going even higher, or still being able to sell your hashing power in the future? Or was your cost for each GH/s much lower and you happened to get in early?

### Reply 19:
they will hash forever and ever (or until some scam / hack / natural death / it ends). its not really much of a gamble, just a flat out loss versus mining yourself unless you factor in risks like your hardware breaking, house burning down, etc.There was never a point where they were willingly offering GH/s at a ""good deal"" price, one of the larger deals that is pure profit is obtaining the GH/s via referrals. The fact that they're able to monetize this points directly to botnet and/or they are clearly making a good profit on the upsell.In short, they're buying the same equipment you could buy (maybe at a bulk discount, maybe not) and selling it to you and making a profit on the service. As the generation % of 1gh/s changes, the value of it should go down but... randomly hasn't, etc.for example i will sell you a % of my GH/s for 1% more than the coins it generates are worth to be assessed and paid daily. Deal?

Um, hate to tell you this but the S3 (and s1, s2, s4, s5, s7, s9, T9, R4) ONLY mine Bitcoin or one of the few other SHA256D algo coins. Since the algo is hardwired into the chips that is all they can mine. Period. End of story.The coins you mentioned are altcoins and are mined using GPU-based rigs. Info for them is found in the altcoin hardware section.""Came without wires""? Such as what? All they need is a PSU and network connection. If you are talking about the little ribbon cables that run between the RasPi and hash boards - you are screwed unless someone has a few gathering dust in a drawer somewhere....

### Reply 2:
I'm not sure how much revenue you are hoping to generate, but i reckon with all 4 machines you would be generating around $1 or $2 per day. You might struggle on some pools that do not pay out ""dust"" (ie very small and invaluable) rewards on a regular basis. i understand some pools pay these out on an annual basis so it saves transaction fee's etc. There are however upgrade kits you can buy that greatly increases the has rate of the S3's - search the forum and you will find them (unsure exactly where the post is). This will cost more money to do so, but i would certainly recommend looking into it at lease. PS - not sure on your set up, but 4 antminers will generate a lot of heat and noise

### Reply 3:
The only ones for the S3 were either the ones Bitmain sold to convert an S1 to an S3 which has long been sold out and Sidehacks planned blades which arent out yet and utilize bitfury chips. Search sidehack and youll find it in his post history or recently made threads.

### Reply 4:
Or the apparently very difficult to acquire Hotmine stuff, that turns a S1 chassis into about a 900W miner.

Proposed question:I pre-ordered multiple FPGA Single, and I received them all.I pre-ordered multiple ASIC SCs, and I've received most of them. The rest were ordered later, and they haven't gotten to them yet.I will admit that I was contemplating ordering from KNC or BitFury, but now I'll have to reevaluate that position.Out of all the hardware being offered, this new Monarch's claimed specs seem to be the most profitable, and I don't imagine any new hardware coming along and changing that. (KNC is also 28nm, but it's not a full-custom chip. BitFury is a fully-custom chip, but it's only 45nm, not 28nm. Both are just starting to roll out, and neither has any units in customer's hands. Avalon or ASICMiner could die-shrink, but I don't think that will help. They'd have to redo everything to accommodate a larger, <truncated> design.)So they have a spotty track record, but they've always delivered. They seem to have the best product for sale (or pre-order, depending on how you look at it). Why shouldn't I buy one? Or 10?

### Reply 19:
Forget about all the tech mumbo jumbo it all boils down to a very simple statement. By now most ASIC manufactures can self fund since they collected plenty of money over and above their costs on these 1st batches. Also they have plenty of information regarding hash rates, possible sales price points, wholesaler demands, consumer demands and prices they are willing to pay in relation to all the other factors, etc... So the only reason to do pre-orders now is because they think what they are getting now will be a lot more then what they possible can get if they simply built it and sold it as it is coming in. And that's the nice business version. The nasty version is we collect pre-order money build it and if it is worth more then what we collected we will sell a bunch out the back door or give out to friends and relatives first before starting to ship. I would love to hear a different argument.

Topic: Decentralisation of the Bitcoin mining pools

Hi,Looking at the hashrate distribution I notice the top 2 pools control more than 50% of the network. Does this not concern anyone that Bitcoin has less than 20k nodes and a hashrate hyper concentraded -- considering the narrative has always been censorship money. It is unlikely but Foundry the biggest mining pool with close to 30% of the network hashrate is based in the US -- there is a scenario in which the US could ban bitcoin, its usage or simply mining. What would happen in that case ?Does the concentration between AntPool and Foundry scare anyone? > Hashrates will be more and more concentrated over time [as the network grows in size and hardware becomes more expensive] does this not threaten the sovereignty of the network -- going fully against the Satoshi ethos ?How far did Satoshi envision the decentralisation, are there counter mesures at hyper concentration events? What could be done in order to mitigate that?Does it pose an existential threat to the value proposition of bitcoin ?I would like to get different views on that and none with the Stock-to-flow answer.This leads me to my ultimate question: if bitcoin is centralised how good is it ? notably in comparaison to oth<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
A mining pool cannot ban bitcoin mining even if it has more than 51% hashrate. The pool may not take transactions into its own blocks, but then the profit of the miners on this pool will greatly decrease. The miners will go to other pools, and this pool will go bankrupt and lose customers due to the scandal. I don't think that the mining pool will violate the rules of coin mining.

### Reply 2:
To put it simply, either they follow the rules or they fork to a new coin.If they fork to a new coin, then that wont be Bitcoin and the miners will leave.As for transaction bias, well as long as you stay away from braiins pool who is actively promoting transaction bias,for other pools, if the pool itself stops allowing all transactions, then yeah, people will just go to another pool that will give a better return.Complete lack of transaction bias ensures a maximum return on mining, which is bitcoin by design = allow all transactions, highest fees get confirmed fastest.

### Reply 3:
Miners start using other pools.NopeI don't think there is any threat. Miners will keep getting in and exiting the network depending on how affordable and profitable it is to them. The Hardware is only expensive because it brings in good profits. So even the mining hardware manufacturers have that in mind. You can't price hardware at $100,000, yet it can't even make $1,000. Who will buy it?

### Reply 4:
~16.5K reachable nodes[1] and ~75K nodes[2] isn't worrying for me. As for pool hashrate, my only concern is they could perform attack which doesn't attract much attention. For example, exclude certain transaction or fill block with their own ""non important"" transaction[3]. Otherwise, i expect they'll follow consensus protocol since it'll lead to more profit on long term.[1] <link> <link> <link>

### Reply 5:
I'd say way better. If you argue that mining centralization is a big issue then other blockchains have other forms of centralization that might affect the network more than some miners mining in one pool IMO. For example, developers belong to one organization that needs to follow regulations where they live, new miners/node need to be approved by some people before they can start participating in the network, and so on. In my opinion, the chance that your transaction is blocked in such a blockchain is way higher than if you use Bitcoin, even if mining power is concentrated on one or two pools. CMIIW.

### Reply 6:
If you look at the old information on pool hashrates by country, then China was in the lead before the ban on mining in this country. In POV mining, it is impossible to block transactions because miners want to get the maximum profit from their work. And in POS mining, the owners of most coins can always change the consensus rules.

### Reply 7:
it is concerning. many are concerned

### Reply 8:
Who are these many? Pools have come close to if not gone over 50% in the past. And large groups of miners left them and went elsewhere. When pooled mining first became a thing there were only a couple of major pools and everyone else was still solo mining. It's not a real concern for people who understand that everything is always going to be in flux with this. The real major concern, which is still not a real concern, would be who controls the miners that are mining at these pools. If some government wanted to take over Bitcoin mining they could over a period of years acquire well over 50% of the hash rate. But if they took part of the hash rate and pointed it to one pool another part to another pool and so on, nobody would ever know about it until all the sudden they pointed it at their own pool. But due to the power requirements whic<rest of thread truncated>

Topic: S5 Startup/ Unable to access Miner UI via IP
### Original post:
Hi there I have been trying to connect my S5 Ant Miner to my network for the last week and it's just not working. I have done all the research I can and it has got me nowhere. I really need some help. I have a 1200 watt HP power supply with a breakout board adapter with 6 pin connectors. I've contacted the seller because i think they tried to short me do to the fact there are only 2 wires going into the 6 pin connectors instead of 6. The power supply is functioning and receiving power it has a led display that shows what the power output is. It says it's outputting 12.2. The miner powers up but I am unable to access the miner UI through the IP address. I am able to ping the miner and no pings are lost o% loss. There are 4 green lights and 1 red light in the middle, of the bottom antboard. I have pictures of the unit and the setup but am not able to attach them to this message. I'm definitely outside my depth rn and would love some help thanks all! New to the forums. Sorry if the question formatting is incorrect.

### Original post:
I'm a newbie GPU miner. I chose GPUs and still would because I enjoy the flexibility of gliding across the algorithm spectrum over which bitcoin reigns. I held out and mined as long as I could to attain the almighty bitcoin. Finally, I've come to the conclusion that my miners will sit idle until the crypto scene is once again profitable here in the land of $.15 per Kw/hour electricity. It hasn't even been a year since I started which leaves me with severely dashed hopes. But I am still hopeful for crypto to once again make headlines and have GPU prices soaring far past what they should be. I'm proud of my own accomplishments even though I haven't yet been profitable. I built a respectable fleet of miners totalling 15 GPUs across 5 platforms. I gained an appreciation for server managers as they are surely profiting despite recent slow downs. I sorted through code, learned about compilation and dependencies and tweaked/optimized feverishly to attain optimized mining results.I do continue mining on some cards that are more cost effective so I have some meager bitcoin coming my way but not much. I'm eyeing the markets like a hawk and hope to see my GPUs reenter the fray someday.This ha<rest of post truncated>

I don't think you will ever be mining with those GPUs again. I calculated that with the current difficulty, a GPU with an efficiency of 3 MH/J will break even at $0.10/kWh only if BTC is over $64k.

Grab a voltmeter and verify that the outlet has power, the PSUs have power, and that you have tried one from the confirmed working PSU list.<link> it open and carefully, after touching the case to discharge static, make sure that nothing is unplugged.

1) Make sure the PSU will turn on without being plugged into anything with the ""paperclip test"" <link> it does not power on then you have a bad (or 2 bad) PSU and need a replacement, I recommend at least 750 watt preferably 1000W+2) If PSU does power on, then make sure you are connecting the power cables correctly:Note: some of the internal cables and connectors could come loose during shipping. Not likely but possible, they should be checked to make sure a flush and tight connection is made - make sure everything is plugged all the way in.The far left 6-pin port connects via a short cable to the controller board. Don't mess with it. Next to it is the ATX_24p connector. It has 24 pins and it connects to the big 24 pin connector (some PSU have 20 + 4 that need to be pinched together during plug in, this can cause a problem if the 20 pin clicks in but the +4 pin is not completely plugged in). Make sure the PSU 24 pin is plugged in correctly, with the depressable tab on ""top"" facing to the right where it matches up with the tab catcher on ""top"". It should click when it is all the way plugged in. It is a tight fit and hard to get this plug in without hurting your fingers or using needl<rest of post truncated>

Topic: Hardware - It's really hard to buy mining hardware
### Original post:
I am relatively new to bitcoin mining and it's really hard to decide on which hardware to buy and from where. I see all the complaints about buying a pre order, so I will never pay for something that is not already shipping. Then there are those obviously fake websites trying to claim that they have a 15 TeraHash miner and another that advertises that by September they will have a miner running at 6 TeraHashes for only $5,000. And then even if you want to buy a machine that is actually real, would you send your money to China with no recourse if you don't receive your machine. Why do these companies only want to be paid in bitcoins or with a wire transfer, if they are not scams? Now I see a company advertising a 600 GH and a 1 TH PCI card - wouldn't that be great if we could use our computers again to mine for bitcoins, but I'm not going to take a chance and pre-order one of these cards for $3,000.I want to buy something with a credit card or with Paypay. I have purchased my mining hardware from EBay - I have 9 Antminer S1 systems. They may not be the latest and best, but I have received them without being ripped off.I'd like to know what every thinks about all the scams out there <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Just buy coins.

### Reply 2:
I don't mine, but I think a major problem with getting the hardware is how long it takes to get to you after you order it. I have heard that often times by the timeyour equipment reaches you, it is almost outdated and there is new equipment out there. As the difficulty continues to increase, it often times would be better just to buy the BTC from an exchange (if that is your ultimate goal).

### Reply 3:
So if coins are selling for $600, then I could buy 8 for $4,800. What could I hope to make? Where do you think the price is going? Double, Triple or back down to $200. I lost money in the stock market - I don't plan on losing money by buying coins. I don't know why the latest strategy and suggestion is to buy bitcoins? Maybe when you could buy 10,000 for $1 when they first came out as a joke, but not at $600. Sure, it's possible that a coin will be $5,000 a year from now, but I have my doubts.

### Reply 4:
If that is the case then you will lose more if you buy hardware.If you buy x coins now, they will still be x coins in a year.If you buy miners now they will be obsolete within 3 months.EDIT: If you are determined to get miners my advice would be the Antminer S2

### Reply 5:
Reputable place would be Bitmaintech .com or Jonesgear .com if you want to pay in paypal or credit card. Bitmain is only bitcoin or bank wire transfer. 73'sIn Bitcoin We Trust!Edit: Bitmaintech has the miners to my door in 2 1/2 days to Midwest from china.. Jones Gear drop ships from bitmain may take couple extra days..

### Reply 6:
Just to give you an idea an AntMiner S2 (running at 1TH/s) would yield about 0.3 BTC/day ($23/day). Assuming that difficulty doesn't change (IT WILL!) you'd ROI in roughly 100 days. You won't be able to run an S2 profitably (assuming $0.10/kwh) after network rate hits ~800m. If you have cheaper power (unlikely unless you're on a big commercial plan) you might make it a little longer, say 1.5b GH/s.

### Reply 7:
It is easy to buy hardware, it is just hard to have it arrve, arrive on time, arrive on time and work.why not hold on to your coins, past experienc shows it is the best way to make money with bitcoin. not the answer you wanted to hear but its the truth.

### Reply 8:
Mining is a risk just like buying, only difference with buying a bitcoin is that you do not need to see a $12k appreciation to breakeven.

### Reply 9:
I think you mean the Antminer S2 is making 0.03 BTC / day

### Reply 10:
If you're dead set on buying mining equipment that ships in a week and using your credit card, I'd recommend this company:<link> the best prices, but should be on your doorstep in less than a week and you can use either bank wire, BTC, or credit card to pay.Also, if you're just starting out, I'd recommend one of the smaller miners like the Rockminer R-box or Antminer S1 to see if mining is for you.

### Reply 11:
If it's not pre order (you have to know who you pre order from) it is not profitable. It's pure and simple loosing money. So, it is better to buy coins and hold. As simple as that.

### Reply 12:
No more questions, just do it. Bitcoin may be trustless, but you can trust the good honest folks on this forum.Except the ones trying to sell you gambling shit in their sigs, those guys are aholes.

### Reply 13:
Hey, I take offense to that! My sig is purty and shiny.I'm Mister Asshole to you.

### Reply 14:
Well it isn't really that hard to buy hardware, but if you wanna ROI or profit.. that isn't easy. I see mining more of a way to support the network these days. If you wanna profit, then you should buy coins instead and just hold for long.

Topic: SCAM: CoinMiner at bitcoin-miner-pro.com steals wallet
### Original post:
It's come to my attention that a miner called CoinMiner is being distributed at <truncated> is nothing more than my own GUIMiner with a wallet stealing trojan attached. DO NOT DOWNLOAD this miner unless you want to lose all your coins and maybe worse. It will not increase your mining speed or do anything else magical except send your wallet to some scammers.I'm very upset that my free software is being used in this way and have contacted the site owners, but I don't expect that they will be very cooperative. I just wanted to warn people not to use it, and if anyone wants to DDOS their site that would be cool. (Joking)

### Reply 1:
Site's down now.

### Reply 2:
well, I hope you consider changing the license of GUIminer to something that makes it stay free software, but prohibits malicious redistribution of that code. At least you could then file a lawsuit against them, for copyright issues. Also, be sure to get a whois output for their domain and report their doings to the registrar. then do a whois on the ip-address where the site is hosted and write some mail to their hoster.(if domain registrar and hoster are not the same company). These usually react fast to complaints. They react even faster to DMCA complaints(in case you really change your license)

### Reply 3:
Sometimes when visiting it I get an error, other times it goes through. Looks like the server reliability is not great. I'm still able to access the site now.The license is GNU GPL and I believe they are already in violation of it (though I'm no lawyer), at least by not distributing the source code to their modified version. I tried a whois and apparently they're with ezinom.com. I guess that's who I can write mail to?

403 Forbidden error..It seems they already went down.. or away..

### Reply 5:
Got a couple SPAM emails from then as well :/The address was apparently harvested from the Mt. Gox database leak.

### Reply 6:
yep, ezinom.com should be responsible. If they do not react, you can also contact Californian Authorities for (helping) violating the US-CAN-SPAM act(ezinom is, according to their whois record listed as a company in CA). US-Authorities can then seize the domain name.

### Reply 7:
I just filed an abuse report to the abuse contact of solid.nsjet.com (where the emails were coming from, which is the same IP address that is hosting the site), after they basically acknowledged that they are violating CAN-SPAM, claiming that it doesn't apply to them because they are on the Bahamas, and explicitly refusing to exclude me from further mailings.

@TheSevenif a hosting provider does not agree to stick to such things as SPAM ""because they are offshore and dont give a crap about foreign laws and policies"", you can and should always make clear that you will warn others to stay away from them because they condone spam. If they are a serious business they will know what happens to hosters that allow spamming: People will stay off them because they could have a spammer on their node having negative effects on their own website rating.You could also try to go a level up - I had this some time with a US company that simply ignored the spam issue - They were hosted with BurstNet(who are pretty strict and fast when it comes to the do nots) as resellers. So I contacted burst and it took about a day until the whole hosting company went offline. Also I'd consider asking a lawyer(there are lawyers that accept bitcoin) for a new free software license that allows modification but forbids malicious modification. Unfortunately you cannot alter the GPL or most other licenses to adept to your likes, because the weird thing about those licenses is that they are usually under pretty restrictive licenses themselves(i.e. if you alter the GPL you br<rest of post truncated>

Since Avalon is auctioning their new 320-chip models starting at 16btc, (.05btc/chip) the chips alone are maybe worth half that.

Your compensation is you can bid on the units they have been hashing with for the last 6 months

Agreed. Chip buyers should be refunded to equalize this price point at bare minimum. They are literally selling entire pre-built units for HALF the price that chip buyers paid for just the chips to go into a unit.For example, 320 chips at half the price of a unit = 7.5btc which comes out to .0234btc per chip. 10,000 chips * .0234 = BTC234. Thus, it equates that chip purchasers should be refunded at LEAST BTC550 per order. Even at that price point Avalon would cover their costs of the chips and still be making a significant profit margin on the chips.

That's not even mentioning the price break for buying 10k chips. I think a case could be made for a sub .02 value. Still, Yifu needs to make this right, or risk a rep. as bad as Pirateat40 aka Trendon Shavers.

Hey all,This is the Fury Thumb from the original v1.2 group buy, not avalon.The drillbit forum used to have everything I needbut it is offline. Even wayback machine can't find it.I used to run it with cgminer and a shortcut that you used as the target. It contained the path, drillbit options, timing,and more. I pretty much need it in cut and paste format as I neverreally understood it, only that it worked.There were also reset instructions where you crossed a couple of pinsuntil the led flashed differently.Lastly, and not crucial at the moment, there were instructions onoverclocking, but getting it running is whats important now.I'll appreciate the help.

Are you reading the speed at the pool or on the internal web display?

That is your problem. You have a blade down. Turn it off for a few mins and reboot and see if you get that blade back. Check the cables as well. If the power falls off to the slave blade this can happen.

Topic: The Miner Don't Working In  iMac
### Original post:
I just got a new iMac at work (I'm a PC/linux guy, but my boss is a Mac guy). It has a ATI 6970, which is one of the best video cards for bitcoin mining today. So I figure I'll download Diablo miner and set it up to run with default settings. Apparently Open CL doesn't work very well on a Mac, so I was only mining at about 1/4 the rate that the 6970 would get in a PC, but still figured it would be worth it to run it over the weekend.So I come back on Monday, and the computer is froze. I restart, and I'm getting visual artifacts on the screen, and it freezes, usually at the login screen, sometimes it logs in, only to have more video artifacts, and freezes shortly after. I'm pretty sure I fried the video card. I'm assuming that the iMac must have really bad cooling on the video card, and it overheated. Aren't there any safety features to shut down the computer if the hardware is getting dangerously hot?I load in safe mode, and delete everything related to bitcoin or the diablo miner, and call the company's tech guy complaining my New iMac is acting up, acting like I have no idea why it would do that.

### Reply 1:
A 6970 was a pretty good card back in the day, but that day was 2+ years ago. Now it's about on par with a USB Block Erupter which only consumes 2.5 Watts vs 300 to 400 watts your Mac would draw if it even worked, and a Block Erupter isn't worth mining with anymore as it draws too much power. If your doing this to goof around, know you'll never break even.

### Reply 2:
Diablo miner was one of the oldest miner's out there, so it probably didn't. That was why CGMiner was such a big deal, because it used the ADL libraries to monitor temps and would throttle or shut down the GPU when it reached the preset temps. But CGMiner doesn't support GPU's anymore since they aren't a viable mining device any longer.

What you want is parallel mining, it's a long story, the short version of it is ""no"".What you can do instead is download AwesomeMiner, it's free since you have only 1 miner, and then use the change pool command based on time intervals and so you can achieveSon 1 worker : 12AM to 12PMSon 2 worker : 12PM to 12AMYou can do 6 hours each or any other combination, but try to switch pools as less frequently as possible since it results in a loss of some mining rewards.

Hi All,I have bought an S9 for my sons and I to play with (more of a learning/fun activity rather than a get rich quick scheme!)Is there a way to create multiple workers that mine to their own pools from the same s9?For example?Assume the s9 runs at 14th.I want a workers that runs at 4TH for Solo Mining (ckpool)Son 1 wants his own worker that runs at 5TH on a pool of his choiceSon 2 wants his own worker that runs at 5th on a pool of his choice.I know this is counter intuitive based on getwork requests, etc but I dont want to buy 3 x S9's that are good for nothing as it is!RegardsStav

Hi all Miners, I experienced a few miners S9K starting loosing its fan. FAN 1 to be exact.Anyone of u have the same experienced? Is only 7 months old.MM

### Reply 1:
It's a well-known issue on S9k but if it still spinning physically you can try this belowIt's worth to try to fix it by:- Remove the fan and then put or attach it back then test.- Cleaning the fan terminals use Laquer flo thinner to clean them then test it again.- Resolder terminals are also worth trying.If these three methods don't work well replacement is the final solution as suggested above.

### Reply 2:
Yeah 7 months to 2 years they all go.pick up a replacement on ebay or amazon<link> went to ebay and picked first two in the searchyou want 6000 rpm to 7500 rpm 4 pin pwmIf you get lucky maybe 8 bucks a fan I don't want to really search it out tonight. You can do it .I do not know those fan sellersIf you look harder you could save a few bucks.

### Reply 3:
How is that an S9k issue? this is more like every fan on planet earth's issue, running for months with probably little no cleaning is enough to toast any fan, it really has nothing to do with the S9k model itself, S9k is indeed the worst miner as far as the control board and hashboards are concerned, but it's a matter of luck when dealing with fans, I have some fans that spin for nearly two years at 90% without a problem, some die in a few months, you just got to blame your luck and move on, there isn't really any way around to fix those fans given their cheap prices.OP, get yourself a new fan/s as Phill said, and I would advise you to actually get an extra one because pretty soon the other one might stop working too, a spare fan and a spare PSU are really important, this is why owning a single miner is probably a bad idea, because buying a spare fan, PSU and a control board for a single miner is not the best thing to do, but if you have a few of them and keeping a single piece of spare of everything makes a lot of sense.On a side note, I am not sure if this just by chance, but I noticed that setting a fixed fan speed on those fans even at high RPMs of 90%, the fans tend to last lo<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 4:
running a fan at 70 or 75 or 80 or 85 or 90 percent static setting is far better then auto tuning a fan.100% setting is stupid as it burns up and does not cool much better then 90%auto tuning also kills them.I try to set fans to 70 and track temps if needed bump to 75. and up to 90 if needed.Antminer gear can sometimes use a lower fan even a 4000 rpm set to 90% may work depends on what miner you are using.all s9's will run with a 4700 rpm model set to 85% static.now it may be you set a really high freq and are burning up with that fan but the miner will try to run.When it checks the fans for speed to determine you have working fans it looks for the fans to get up to 4000 rpm or higher at 100% .this is a slower lower energy fan<link> gear will run on a low speed setting with this fan. I use it to make one and 2 board space heating s9'sdo not get any fan weaker than this.also have a good understanding OF WHAT YOU ARE DOING IF YOU GO THE LOWER WEAKER FAN ROUTE.ie don't think an s9 will do 3 boards at 15th with these fans.

### Reply 5:
not sure how the speed running on S9 and T9+, but these old model miner fan seems running longer than S9K.BTW, i just changed the fan. Thanks miners.

### Reply 6:
I highly doubt the quality of the fans on the S9 and T9+ are any better than those on the S9k, the latter miner is indeed the worst of all, I have created a whole topic explaining why one shouldn't be purchasing Antminer S9k.I wouldn't be surprised if the way the firmware handles the fans' speed makes them die sooner, I have not experienced that because I set static fan speed on all of them, took me a while to figure out how to do it, but not more than a few days which indeed not enough to toast them.Meanwhile, I suggest you set a fixed fan RPMs just to be on the safe side, you can follow this guide and set the % you desire for the fans, I personally use 90% most of the time, but the % you chose is up to you, if you face any issues in doing so, ask in that thread and I will happy to assist you.

### Reply 7:
If he got a real delta ball bearing fan it is better.also san ace denki ball bearing is very good.some times I got deltas on s9 miners.i once got a case of san ace or sanyo fans they were really good.but a lot of s9 gear has shit generic or counterfeit fans.

### Reply 8:
Everything comes with a price, last I checked delta fans for S9 go for above $20, which is way too much IMO, I bought a bunch of cheap fans from a Chinese supplier I paid like 3$ each, and believe it or not they were pretty good, obviously nothing like those high-end fans you suggested, but the life-span of any given miner is way too short to be worth an expensive fan IMO.The good part, however, is that most Antminer fans have almost the same size and specs, <rest of thread truncated>

asic miner tubes have 'bad' software. you can not use every pool only some work.it is possible that bitminter went back to a different set of instructions. I had a tube a while back it only worked with mmpool.org and ghash.io some pools altered their software to allow tubes to work. slush did. i guess bitminter went from bad to good to bad. kano's pool was bad then good then bad about using the tube. so i guess bitminter did the same thing.

### Reply 1:
When you say ""low electricity"" what do mean?Plug in your information and see for yourself what the costs will be and any potential profits will be with a mining calculator.<link> may want to check out a few different calculators. Some give you more/better information than others. Combined, they will give you the big picture.The speed of your internet connection is inconsequential. Mining is not internet intensive. Just need a stable internet connection.Air conditioning may not be the issue. AC will be fine to cool off the room, but you REALLY need a way to vent the heat outside of the room. That is one of the most important, IMHO.

I have no way of answering that question if you don't say what your electric cost is. That was why I asked. I don't care if you call it ""low"" or ""cheap"". What is the cost?

Topic: [COUPONS AVAIL] AsicMiner USB Block Erupters - BTC Guild Coupons Available
### Original post:
I'm currently offering 6 x .4 erupter coupons... Willing to let all 6 go for .256 erupters for 2.65 shipped directly to you from the guild = approx. .44 a piece As for trust you can check my feedback on bitmit (same username) - Do not want to harm my credit in this community over 2.65...Other members not wanting to use the .4 coupons are free to list and resell them here. As Eleuthria has kindly asked to not overwhem the Guild thread with reselling coupons.

### Reply 1:
Uh ... I'm not sure I understand this offer. The BE's are being sold outright for 0.33BTC each, plus maybe 0.06BTC for shipping in the US. No coupon needed, and near unlimited quantities. Did you perhaps mean a 0.1BTC coupon offer? A link to the other thread you mention would also be helpful.Edit: Did you mean you're selling them at 0.44BTC each, 0.25BTC each, or 0.25BTC total? Sorry, I'm not reading right tonight. If the last one, I'm interested. Let me know and we can work out shipping.

### Reply 2:
Ah, much clearer now, thanks. But I'm afraid I'll have to pass on the offer. Good luck with it!

### Reply 3:
Thanks!

### Reply 4:
Sorry, might be partly my fault as well.. I have 6 coupons for erupters from BTC Guild.. (Not Asicminer coupons) These are from the guild promotion.. .4 per erupter... Price Set by Eleuthria on BTC Guild. Not by AsicMiner..I am aware of the pricing in some of the group buys. I am willing to sell all 6 of my coupons for .25 meaning total price would be 2.65 for 6 erupters.. Approximately .44 a piece.. I am not selling erupters. I am offering up these coupons for someone who wants to order erupters from the guild for a better price than would be without the coupons. (even after the extra .25 is tacked on this deal beats the current BTC Guild price by over .05 per erupter ) After receiving .25 I will place the order and set them to be shipped to your address directly. The purchaser of the coupons will then send the 2.4 payment to the guild confirming the order.

### Original post:
Hi All,This hasn't really been explored in depth from what I can see after spending the last few hours sifting through many posts in various sections of this great forum. Needless to say I spend 99% of my time reading and 1% posting - so I thank everyone in advance for their contribution to what I feel is a much needed topic of discussion.I would like to please get some comments/dialogue on the following queries:1. What is the 'best' wallet to mine directly to? I'm talking about an address that doesn't change that you can point your workers to or get pool payouts sent to **Loaded question with no definitive answer I know but there are so freaking many it's insane to have to choose from all of them there must at least be a top ten list somewhere that has been thoroughly thought out and explored from every angle**. So for a top ten list I'd like to explore hardware based, app based, desktop based, online hot wallets, exchanges, just leaving the coins in the pool itself for a long period of time, others?2. The highest level of security and most stable/long lived wallet to mine to?

### Reply 1:
The wallet you chose isn't related to mining. In other words, the fact that you're mining or not shouldn't affect the wallet you chose.Unless you don't mine with a pool and need to run a full node, which I don't recommend to a beginner.Choosing a wallet is a lot about your needs and how you plan to move your funds after you mine them.It's usually a balance between security and ease of use.

Thank you unholycactus I will check out multibit it's a new one I am not familiar with - I am aware of the others and currently investigating Thank you again for your response I really appreciate your input :-)Have a nice day! Good karma to you!-jd

### Reply 5:
If you have at least 300 GB free in your hard disk I would suggest you to download the Bitcoin core wallet. I say 300 GB so you can be ready even for next year when the size of the blockchain will grow more than it is actually at about 150 GB. It is one of the most secure wallets which is free. It takes time to download and sync but once it is done it is worth every minute you spent syncing it.

### Reply 6:
Done. Revamping my setup to allow for the extra space and the backup of that space. Appreciate the comment re:What will happen to coins in the bitcoin core wallet after August 1st? Your time and help is duly noted and very much appreciated. Good karma to you All the very best and kindest regards,-jd

Coins in the bitcoin core wallet will remains same, only potential change regards value; however, actual coin quantity remains unchanged.

For racks, just use normal wire-frame racks available from Home Depot etc. like these which are 20"" wide Very old pic - those were s1's...

### Reply 5:
Thank you...I will be using the PSUS for Antminers provided by Bitmain. So this should be good for those? I am planning to run 128 of them in total.

### Reply 6:
Thank you. I like the mesh ones but the thing with those is I am not sure how to create a hot and cold isle with that. Since the racks are a little fragile there is no place to put the drywall to contain the heat. Do you make containment aisles in your new ones?P.S. What's that thing from Tripplite?

### Reply 7:
The racks are far from fragile. Big or small they are quite sturdy. As see in the pic each shelf has a lip perfect for attaching things to including drywall if desired.Those were 1kW stand-by UPS's. The old S1's only drew about 450w and at the time power at home in my area blipped off-on at least 1 once a month so it was practical to use them. Now days with miner power needs over 1kw I would not advise using UPS's unless absolutely needed. Just too expensive.

### Reply 8:
okay 128 x 1500 = 192,000 wattsyou can just about do 4 units per pdu.You need bigger pdu's then the ones I gave you.There are some 50 amp pdus aroundmore costly but they should do 9 s-9's<link>

### Reply 9:
Thank you...So if I just use the ones with the 4 it will be much cheaper. I will be able to use 2 of those to plug 8 units for just 80 bucks where as this 50 amp one costs 299 dollars and will house just 9 units...I think that would be okay, right?

Topic: Heat & Where to Stick It...
### Original post:
It's looking like the initial set-up I'll be going for is 2x Avalon 741 & 1x Antminer L3+. It's not a major set-up or anything, but it's going to generate a sufficient amount of heat. To make it worse, I'm located in Louisiana... 100+ F temps in the summer with A LOT of humidity. I'd appreciate your suggestions on how to manage the heat and airflow. I'll be installing a 220V line for whatever space in which the miners end up unless you guys feel that is unnecessary. Noise is a concern (wife and 4 kids), but I'm not opposed to installing sound insulation if necessary. I'm an engineer and am not afraid of doing any of the work myself (except for any electrical). Options: House is large, has AC, and has room to store the miners within a closet or within an enclosure in the utility room. Note: Utility RM shares boundary with garage and is immediately adjacent to breaker panel (opposite side of wall). It also has access to the existing dryer vent, which goes directly outside of the house. Possibly a very bad idea given the high fire-risk of dryer lint.I have an attic with a lot of available space to set up the miners. Note: likely not an option due to how hot the ambient temperature in <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 2:
I was checking through your photos, and was wondering, are your exhaust fans constantly running, or do you have them set on a temperature switch for on/off operation. I'm looking into different designs for next spring and didn't want to forget to ask? At the moment I am looking into the best way to rig my avalon exhaust to my furnace return air intake in the basement. My plan is to widen my return air intake in the basement and mount my miners within a few feet, and restrict the main air intakes on my main level by half or so. I might just have to run a few feet of ducting wide enough to accommodate the airflow to within a foot of the miner exhaust. I figure by running my furnace fan constantly instead of on/off with the thermostat, I can keep a steadier heat in the house and that will be the most efficient use of the miner heat. The 4 miner set up will equal about 20% of my furnace at full capacity, so with steady fan circulation this will greatly offset my power consumption costs, as I'm going to need it anyways.Winter is coming.

It appears they have sent me compensation automatically for my delayed T17+ units, as I received just under 1500 usd of coupons today and they are named 'T17 coupons' - unless it is standard to receive these after every order is shipped?

### Reply 4:
No that was to make up for their screw up.Coupons vary in quality. Some are 10% some are 20 % some are 30 %So if you do an order for 1000 and have a 300 dollar 10% coupon you get to use 100 of the coupon. and the order becomes 900a 1000 order with a 300 dollar 20% coupon you get to use 200 of the coupon and the order becomes 800a 1000 order with a 300 dollar 30% coupon you get to use 300 of the coupon and the order becomes 700So 30% coupons have more value then 10% coupons.Of course if you don't need the coupons they can be given for free to other people or you can try to sell them aftermarket .The sales section for bitmain coupons would be digital goods.<link> is an older offer to buy coupons<link> is an old offer to sell some<link> anyone now waiting on a bitmain order this post may help you get some compensation coupons.

It's a 10% coupon. To be honest that's not particularly good compensation, as it's really only any use if I intend to make another big order (15,000usd upwards).

### Reply 2:
While I expect it's valuable in terms of effort, I don't see why it would be absolutely critical to get everything changed at once on N miners. What happens if you do N/2 in the afternoon, and N/2 the next morning? I can't imagine the pools would care, nor would the S5 miners. If I had N (N>1) miners I would clearly consider spreading their hash rate across multiple pools. And I certainly wouldn't lose any sleep over the fact they might have different settings. They are all running at different speeds anyway, and using different amounts of power at some level.

You could use a configuration management tool like puppet or cfengine.

### Reply 6:
I use MiningRigRentals for managing pools, of all things. You don't have to use their services, but I can simply point all my miners to their proxy servers once when I first set them up, and then in my account I can manage several different pool configs and groupings easily. Plus, if you decide you want to put your miners up for rent it's easy too. For example say i have about 30 miners. I have 6 different groups of them, each one has 5 miners in the group. I have 6 different mining profiles with different pools and priorities, each one assigned to a group. I set a price for renting them, and if price goes above, it switches to renting, otherwise it mines at the pools I've configured. Switching pools is a few clicks in their web interface.I used to do it by custom written Linux scripts, but this method is so much easier. On top of that I use M's MinerMonitor (you can find it under the mining software us forum) to monitor all of them for their performance, temps, etc.

### Reply 7:
That's also a good way I have my antminer pointed to miningrigrentals and switching pools is a few clicks and if u can get on the Web u can change your pools

There are multiple as mentioned. All have their pro's and con's. I would give Minera a shot as it will run on a raspberry pi -<link> using a raspberry pi you will save electricity compared to a full size pc running 24x7.And MiningRigRentals has some intresting options. I personally don't use it but if you had a miner in a data cener you can't change pool easy setting it to MiningRigRentals will allow you to change pools. And the better way is probley setting up a proxy which I think the amazon free EC2 should be able to do fine.

### Reply 9:
As others have mentioned, Minera is pretty great. There is an ARM image so it is easily flashed to an SD card for a Pi. The statistics are detailed as well. It really allows you to see which miners are underperforming and need to be tweaked. And it automatically attempts to recover miners that go down. It's a time saver so you don't have to go rebooting miners all day.

### Reply 10:
Can you control them(network miners - specificly antminer S5's) from minera? or is it just monitoring?

### Reply 11:
I set up Minera yesterday in hoping I could swap pools etc but had no luck myself. It does do monitoring but that's all I see on a local network. I even tried to swap to my reserve pool on the S3 and it would not even do that. I ended up setting up an account at a mining rental place and pointed my miners there in groups of 5. So far it has been great and I have not noticed any decrease in hash rate.

Topic: Can only boot with 2 cards.
### Original post:
Sorry that I'm reposting this from the newbies section, but I think I would get much better help here.First of all here is some information that should help. I am currently running windows 7 premium 64 bit. The motherboard is a MSI 880G-E45, and I have used it to run 3 5830's in the past when running win XP 32 bit. The PCI-e slots are arranged as follows: 16x(runs at 1x because I tried using tape to force it to 1x), 1x (covered by 1st card), 1x(PCIe x1 extender attached to this), 1x(back cut out to allow 2nd card to be inserted onto mobo). The only real difference between this setup and when it was running XP is that when it was running XP the first 3 PCIe slots were all occupied by pciex1 extenders, leaving the 4th slot empty, but now the first, third, and fourth slot are occupied. When I try to boot up with a card attached to the 3rd slot via extender cable, the computer freezes at the windows boot screen, restarts, and then the bios says that a Hyper Transport Sync Flood Error has occurred. I don't know if it makes any difference, but the PCIEx16 slot is a 2.0 slot and I assume the x1 slots are all PCIE 1.0 because they are not listed as 2.0 in GPU-z, like the 16x slot is.What w<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
What PSU do you have? Have you checked the pins on your extender cables and on the mobo connectors?

### Reply 2:
Its an antec earthwatts 750W. It has had no problem powering 3 cards in the past so that is not the problem. I haven't had time to test the extender cable I'm using for the card in the 3rd slot, but I am going to test that now.

### Reply 3:
AH yep it was a faulty PCIe extender. Thanks for that suggestion.

try this thread:<link> <link> <link> any of the dozen Avalon threads here. But...It's probably around 9 BTC (maybe a little less) per day before power costs at this moment.

### Reply 2:
Hi,It's around 8.2648 BTC(as per bitcoinx.com) per day as per the difficulty level 3,651,012.00, when they mine their own. if they use any pooled mining then less minimum 3% fee.it will be changed in next few days. b'coz the difficulty level will be changed to 4,281,991.00(in next 665 blocks solved as per bitcoinwatch.com) then it goes to 7.0469 BTC per day. now the blocks has been solved approximately 8.21 per hour. this will be solved with in next 80 hours(approx). which means approximately happen in 4 days from this time.then the earning will be goes to 7.0469 BTC(as per bitcoinx.com) per day.Hope my answer will compromise <truncated> Sorry for my English.

### Reply 3:
Thanks guys very much. I really didn't know there were other topics out there since they just came out. My bad, sorry about that. I'll take those numbers, pretty good in my book. Are the avalons really hard to setup? Don't they come with software or anything, drivers for Windows or anything like that or they just go through your USB port?

### Reply 4:
Pretty good? That's like saying winning the lottery makes one able to live a comfortable life.Don't forget, the bitcoin proceeds are relative to one thing ... the difficulty at every point in time that it is mining. If total hashing capacity of the network doubles, the number of bitcoins received when mining with any hardware (e.g., Avalon ASIC) will drop in half.

Topic: Multiple cards with PCI-E-x1 - newbie question
### Original post:
Befor I start to destroy my old MOBO I wanted to ask - will 2 cards work on MOBO, which chipset (P31) doesnt support crossfire/SLI. I'm not going to crossfire my radeons, but just wondering, if it will work.PS. Any advices how to safely cut back of slot?

### Reply 1:
Cutting a slot and running a GPU @1x would not be advisable! Now cutting a 4x slot would be a slightly different story. Just get a new MoBo with 2 PCI-e x16 slots.

### Reply 2:
look for cablesaurus in the selling thread. He's got a variety of custom cables to meet your needs.

### Reply 3:
Nonsense, a PCI-E x1 slot will be ample for what us miners require. Cutting the actual mobo might be tricky, but if you're careful it should be fine. I wouldn't recommend cutting the actual mobo, but as it's old and you seem keen I don't see the harm in it.For some advice on how to cut the extender check out this guys blog:<link> isn't needed for mining and is slower in most cases, you'll have to run a miner for each GPU.

### Reply 4:
I know crossfire isnt best way to mine, but my actual question is if mobo can support both cards. @ buying MOBO - additional costs... I'm just trying to use hardware I already have.@ cables - Im from europe - shipping cost and time are unacceptable

### Reply 5:
yes, pci-e x1 is pretty much the same as pci-e x16oh, you can get x1 extenders for less than $5 shipped on ebay. although you'll have to cut it yourself. not hard.

### Reply 6:
two cards don't mean crossfire

### Reply 7:
Semi-relevant thread hijack:What's the voltage that the PCI-E x1 can give? Is it possible to run a dual GPU card through a PCI-E x1 extender, a 5970 for example.

### Reply 8:
+12v i think

### Reply 9:
Better to get a modified extender cable with a molex for dual GPU cards

### Reply 10:
These cards will be powered by separate PCIe power connectors anyway, so it does not make a difference. PCIe itself provides 75 W of power.I have a HD5570 running with one of these 1x extenders, it consumes about 40 W via the PCIe and has been doing fine for a couple of months.

### Reply 11:
Just done moding. And:ITS WORKING, even when second card doesnt have enough space on mobo (bios battery). BTW, can I remove that battery?

### Reply 12:
Yes, but you will need to set your clock every time that you unplug your desktop from the wall. Some bios also require that you ""load defaults"" if the cmos was erased.

### Reply 13:
I have to load default anyway cuz I think battery died few weks ago, just didnt know it there should be something to clost circuit. Thanks for your help.

You need a PC Power Supply to power it, last ones were sent out with Molex connectors on, but previous ones have had cable screws for the black/yellow cables. You need a PC to run cgminer (linux) or hexminer (windows) on, but it's recommended to use the TP-Link TL-3020 router as a 2Watt Linux PC, there is firmware on their web site that installs everything you need.

Hello,we have created the following website Ayho.es to create a bitcoin miners farm 2.8 TH / s with ASIC chips.On the website you can buy shares from this farm. Here you can see the prices <link> Every year or earlier. It will double the power of the farm (no added cost, free), the idea is to reach 28 TH / s. After reaching that power would attempt to invest in the DESIGN and MANUFACTURE own chip to add more speed, thus avoiding the dependence on other companies that take months to send you orders, if at sometime. All this process will be completely free, without any cost to the shareholder and completely transparent.- Income payments will be made when a certain threshold (selected by the shareholder) is exceeded. These earnings will be deducted the cost of electricity and internet, plus a 2% for maintenance costs.- The mining would be operational around late November early December.- He put a phone number once started mining to resolve any questions or problems.

Topic: Temp PCB or Temp Chips? Btc.com Tools vs Awesome Miner
### Original post:
Hi GuysIm looking at a software from mining monitoring, i want something that gives me reports in CSV files so i can compare de temps of my asics from time to time to make a full historic data.BTC.com tools give me that report for free, but they have the temps of the PCB only and not the chips.Awesome Miner have this function too, and they show the Chip temps.The question is, what temperatures really matter and what is the difference? They change in the same way (now on my farm the difference is at 10C between PCB and Chips)?If PCB temps are ok to monitor, i dont have to pay for awesome.

### Reply 1:
Monitoring the pcb temps could work if you keep in mind that the chip temps can get considerably higher.If you write a simple batch / bash script you can check the stats and generate a csv yourself, I have done it with all 6 temps.

### Reply 2:
Do you mind to share that batch?I dont have programmer skills

### Reply 3:
I think it couldn't give you a good temp result or estimation how hot you're every chip is.@OP if you have more than 2 miners I think it is good if you use the awesome miner when you wanted to monitor the temps of every PCB chips it gives you accurate temps.I think there is a free version of awesome miner but limited to 2 miners.

### Reply 4:
Sure thing. If you want the batch version I would split it up into two scripts, one to get the info and one to compile to csv. Make a new folder, where you will put everything into. First put a list called miners.txt that looks something like this:Code:A1 - 192.168.1.3A2 - 192.168.1.7A3 - 192.168.1.5A4 - 192.168.1.6B1 - 192.168.2.3B2 - 192.168.2.4and so on... Location can be anything you want, even just 1 2 3 etc. Just make sure it is like (location) - (IP) on each line, nothing blank or different format.In this folder you also need a powershell script. Make one and call it clearNull.ps1, with this <truncated> "".\_\"" | ForEach { (Get-Content $($_.fullname)) -replace ""`0"", """" | Set-Content $($_.fullname) -NoNewline }Now make a .bat file for multithreading. Make one and call it _T.bat with the below source. You will need ncat on your system or just download ncat.exe from online and drop it in the folder.Code:@echo offecho Antminer S9 Information Gathering Threadecho.setlocal enableextensions <truncated> /f %%a in ('copy /Z ""%~dpf0"" nul') do set ""CR=%%a""for /F ""tokens=*"" %%A in (_%1.tim) do ( for /f ""tokens=1,3"" %%a in (""%%A"") do ( set ""tx=%%a"" <nul set /p ""=Processing miner on %%b ..<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 5:
The problem is probably with netcat like you mentioned. The step 5 issue is just a result of not having any text files in the folder.The version of netcat that you downloaded relies on external library files. I would use one that is statically compiled specifically for Windows. e.g. <link> Sorry for the confusion, I should have linked to this one specifically. If you still have issues with this ncat.exe let me know.Also you should copy and paste what you have in miners.txt so I can see if you are using the proper format.

### Reply 6:
Nice man, but im having some issues to runI download the netcat from this link <link> and put in the same folderThe ""exe"" file on the rar have the name of nc.exe, so I edited the _T from ""netcat"" to ""nc""When i run, on step 3 the CMD opens another window with ""the system cannot find the path especified"", i think theres a problem with netcat (already give permissions on my antivirus).On step 5 im having this <truncated> : Cannot find path 'G:\Mining Control\_\' because it does not exist.At G:\Mining <truncated> char:1+ Get-ChildItem "".\_\"" | ForEach { (Get-Content $($_.fullname)) -replac ...+ <truncated> + CategoryInfo : ObjectNotFound: (G:\Mining Control\_\:String) [Get-ChildItem], <truncated> + <truncated> : <truncated>

### Reply 8:
The miners.txt format is good, you can make the ""location"" any unique text you want by the way.I sat here staring at it for like 10 minutes until I realized it might be because your folder has a space in it. You should try removing the space from the folder. Also in the folder you have you should make another folder called _ (just one underscore) to hold all the text file results. I didn't mention that before because I thought the program made that folder automatically but I guess not.Let me know if it works and if not idk, I will reduce it to a non-multithreaded<rest of thread truncated>

Just run a second CGMiner version 3.8 or above, that should do the trick.

First, please don't write in all caps. That is usually treated as an aggressive intention.On the other hand, ASICs cannot mine scrypt. They are designed for bitcoin, which uses the SHA-256 algorithm, and not the scrypt one.You can only mine SHA-256 coins. You cannot mine scrypt coins.

Topic: Buying Used 5850
### Original post:
Alright, so I was gonna buy a 5830 from NewEgg to replace my 3850 and start mining, but that opportunity is out the door. I have found someone selling a used sapphire 5850 xtreme on CL and he seems like a nice enough guy, but of course I'm wary. After asking if I could see it in action before buying, he has offered to video it running in his case with a fairly intense 3D game on the monitor, and show that to me when I come to pick it up. I realize this is a pretty big risk, but the price is right. Plus, I have no problem banging the shit out of his door if it's defective until we meet an agreement. Any advice?

### Reply 2:
$130 -- He also noted he was a gamer and upgraded to a 6xxx series card.

see it in person first. make sure you bring a friend.

### Reply 4:
Don't bring money, check it out and offer to meet in a public place (not a parking lot), ask if it's ok to write down his name and address as it appears in his drivers license (if he hesitates, offer yours in return).Recently a man was robbed at gunpoint when he met a CL phone seller at a fast food restaurant.

### Reply 5:
I've done CL transactions before, I'm not worried about getting robbed. I'm more worried that he may have OC'd the GPU and damaged it or something like that, and was wondering if the video seemed like good enough proof to you guys.

The Sapphire 5850 Extreme just came out 2 months ago (for $150 MSRP), it should have a solid warranty.He's probably just an average gamer, I'd ask him to run a stress test for a few mins.Edit: maybe a video which shows the serial, and some stress tests would be great.

Topic: Using functions from api.c in cgminer
### Original post:
Hello!I am creating my own application for manage of Antminer S9.I found source with API here: <link> there is file api.c with functions i need and example in api-example.cBut how i can use API from api.c and create my own application for send command?Is it possible to create library from cgminer for using functions in my C++ project? How is possible to use functions from this project?

### Reply 1:
I put an example in C, Java, PHP and there's also an example in Python and Ruby.Look for the word api in the filenames.If that doesn't help, you'll not be able to write anything anyway.It's a simple socket, you just send a command and get a reply then close the socket.The ""library"" is called socket programming.

it is 19 mill today. will be 21 mill in 3 days. I think 10% each 10 day adjustment.

Topic: S7 miner one board hotter than the others, why?
### Original post:
about a month ago I got a used S7 that has run ok for now. However i've had to reboot a couple of times and I suspect it's because it went over 80C and stopped. I check the board temperatures and one is running at 70-71C while the other two boards are running at 62-63C. Could this be an indication the miner needs a dustoff ? I'm running it next to an S5 (about 4 inches apart) so my other thought is that maybe the S5 is generating heat that is conducting to the S7 board closest to it. The S5 boards are running at 56-65C.Thank you for any help you can provide.

### Reply 1:
possibility that S5 is influencing the higher temperature but to rule that out, you can move S7 into another air conditioned room and power it up and check the temperature. If in colder air conditioned room and 1 pcb is showing still hotter temperature, then, time to open the unit and see if cleaning be needed. We have seen many units with temperature problem had everything you can think of collected and saved on the hash PCB and inside the S7 case.dust, human hair, animal hair, hairball, candy wrappers, parts of vermine, insects. So dust off may help if that is the case.If dust off and in the cold room and the temperature will not be resolved, then please check the intake fan, if it is spinning at at least 3600 RPM. if none of those solves the problem... then you probably have some chips or components that are degraded but still function. At this stage, not sure if its cheap enough to repair or seek used S7 and replace the parts or let it goRepair on S7 pcb can cost from $35-$85 range some are less and some are more.

### Reply 2:
I can't move the S7 to another room but I can power down the S5 for a trial period. So I will do that first. As for the fans I just checked and they are running at 4500 rpm or so. I have seen a lot of dust on the fans so I imagine there's dust on the inside. I saw a few videos on how to clean the S7 so I will take that up once the S5 power down test is complete. As for repairs it's too costly for me to send it for repairs. Are all boards on an s7 the same? this way I could just get a new-er board and keep as spare.

### Reply 3:
if you see heavy dust, probably that be the cause.replacement wise, depends on where you are located,may be cheaper to just buy a replacement PCB. or other units. PCB version or model needs to match as there are several versions of S7 exist

### Reply 4:
How do I know which PCB to get?

### Reply 5:
The thermal paste can go bad too,check that last by removing heatsink & cleaning & reapplying with the correct paste,ask around about what paste is recommended

### Reply 6:
There is no thermal paste in S7....

### Reply 7:
If you clean it and it still runs a little hot thats not really a big deal. Unless it is throwing a ton of hardware errors or crashing all the time just let it run a little hotter.

### Reply 8:
Looking at the exhaust end the board on the left will almost always be a fair bit hotter than the other 2. Reason is the air flow in that location. Same applies to the s9 and t9. Just the nature of the design. The only reason for the *almost* is because s9/t9 miners with auto-tune can change it if Vcore is higher/lower per-board.

### Reply 9:
Coulda sworn I saw folks cleanin & reapplying paste on S7 awhile back....my bad

### Reply 10:
There is thermal adhesive in S5+, S7, S7-LN, S9, R4, T9, L3 and L3+ heatsinks.

### Reply 11:
So today I got an alert that my S7 was offline, again! I couldn't go to turn it back on for almost 8 hours. Thanks to you and some you tube videos I had a pretty good idea that I had to clean it and how. I finally went to my S7 and took it apart. There was caked dust along with some real life bugs that caused obstruction on the front end of the boards. One more than the others. I spent a whole bottle of compressed air cleaning it up inside out and took out each board and blew all the dust out. Eventually I figured I got all the dust out that I could. I put it back together and turned it on. It wouldn't turn on at first but I figured out I hadn't plugged in the front fan first. Plugged it in and got it working fine. Temps are now in the 50-60 range versus the 60-75 range that was before. I hope it can now work for months without stopping. Thank you all for your help.

Topic: Would a C1 survive without water cooling in a -1C cooled room ?
### Original post:
hello, would a C1 survive for 5 days in a room with -1C ? without Water cooling and only 4 Fans ?

### Reply 1:
Real tricky question...You should specify, either celcius or farenheit, this is a 32 degree difference.Think that -1 farenheit is about -30 celcius.In both cases, it's not a good idea for a C1.If the room could have a steady -1 (Celcius) then you would only need a small fan, considering -1 <truncated> the miner is also alone, -1 celcius is not that cold.I have an S4 in a open window bathroom in the middle of the winter the S4 got down to 33 celcius last night...If it's -1 Farenheit then the miner is more at risk of actually freezing and lot worst <truncated> naturally give off heat, the absence of cooling system in such cold weather will create a lot of condensation.Cold environment turns to ""computer sweat"", then to sweat beads, real quick.Ever seen rust on mobo's? That's computer sweat settling in.Water and electricity don't match; you'd need a dehumidifier running 24/7 but then you lose your cold temp since a dehu is a small heater.Once this computer sweat is materialized and melted by the chip heat, turns to water.This makes it at high risk of fire because water can cause serious short circuits. Either way, you'd be better off with S3's since the C1 is designed to be liquid coo<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 2:
Short answer: No

### Reply 3:
You can always modified by putting in some heat sink, aluminum or copper wire and glue it to the center of the chip then fan would helps. But I recommend you not to do it unless you really know what you are doing.

### Reply 4:
I highly doubt it water is amazing at absorbing heat.

### Reply 5:
why ""only 4 fans""? the C1 has a singluar fan. the other 3 are in the cooling loop and will have zero effect if you dont circulate a coolant.unless you planned to circulate air - in which case your pump will last about 5 minutes.tldr; dont buy something designed for liquid cooling and think it will be fine without liquid or cooling.

### Reply 6:
C1 has internal heatsinks and with temp around zero they can work at 225Mhz without liquid cooling, but temperatures can reach 70C on blades which I do not recommend.

### Reply 7:
there is so much surface area on the waterblocks that you might need 10000cfm of air at 0c to keep it running

### Reply 8:
I'm not sure how you will use 4 fans if not using water. But without water it get's to hot and will turn off. I can say I had a cold ambient temp (was months ago in winter) when my syscooling pumps died. It ran and turned off. If you want aircooled your better off with a different miner.

### Reply 9:
Have you ever seen C1? I don't think so. It has not only water block, but also small heatsinks on each blade. It is sufficient when underclocked and even better also undervolted. In case of total failure of fan and pump, after it reaches 100C (or a bit more) it put itself into halt mode with low power consumtion. Bitmain did very good job here.

### Reply 10:
I actually think its possible. If you fill the block with water and close it again it should be able to remove enough heat with very cold ambient air. You might get issues with leaks due to the pressure and plastic caps though.

### Reply 11:
Water required a lot of energy to heat up.

### Reply 12:
The real question is why are you trying to torture your C1?If the room is -1 any temperature, just stick a bucket of coolant next to it with a submersible pump and stick both the intake and the out in the bucket of coolant the cold room will be enough to cool the coolant so the C1 will be happy.Don't torture your miners, love them.

### Reply 13:
it's all about <truncated> it straight to water mains! careful with the pressureorother idea might be doing a siphon system with a big bucket, water jug, 55gallon drum

### Reply 14:
No, unless you put in a heatsink and therma paste (please don't use chocolate as therma paste) into the core then only you can cool it with fan.

### Reply 15:
I really would highly recommend against it. I don't think it is a good idea to risk it if you can bring the water cooling along anyways. Maybe if you hook up a heat sink like someone said above.

### Reply 16:
Please use a chocolate on top of yourself Banana, it might to make you more useful than suggesting stupid things. If you don't know anything about it, do not suggest please.C1 has four heatsinks and two water blocks. With thermal paste from Bitmain, of course. It is enough to cool C1 at cold ambient only by air when underclocked to 225MHz. All Antminers have overtemperature control which stops mining at 80C+, and undocumented failure control which shuts down system at temps over 100C. It is not recommended to run any device at high temperatures, but IC chips used by Bitmain has guaranteed working temperature at 125C (with lower efficiency).

Topic: Creating nonsense fork in blockchain
### Original post:
It is just a stupid question. Imagine if I start mining over an old block which already has many subsequent blocks, find a new block and submit to the network. Will they accept it and create a nonsense fork?I know it is the longest chain that really matters, but would the network accept my block, creating the new fork or simply reject it?

### Reply 1:
Only work for the current block is sent out. If you submit a hash for a past block it will be rejected, probably as stale or not meeting current difficulty.

### Reply 2:
That block will be simply orphaned.To do a fork you need to make your own client with its specific rules, and distribute it to people who will use it.

### Reply 3:
Yeah I understand the block would become orphaned. But would the other nodes add it to their databases or reject it?

### Reply 4:
It would not be orphaned. Work for old blocks is no longer sent. Only work for the current block is sent. So hashes for past blocks would be rejected.

He will probably profit since he has free electricity and the resources. But it also depends on the price of bitcoin after an year or so, as that would also determine if you would profit. Since it isn't too profitable, I would also suggest not starting with it.

Start here and *REALLY* research!<link>

### Reply 5:
If you have cheap electricity, get one of these, but make sure your electrical circuit can handle this:<link> you don't have 208V power outlet or higher, just skip mining altogether.But if you fulfill this requirement, get one of these, mine for like 2 months, then resell the shit out of it...boom profit!Otherwise, mining is really a zero sum game. Too many factors involved: delivery not on time if ever, pre orders are mostly scam/long con, electrical hazard leading to home or building fires, electrical and cooling costs to keep equipment from overheating, difficulty too high and pool luck variance, constantly monitoring and maintaining the equipment is a pain...Alot of things have to bounce right for a miner to even come close to even, or just to minimize loss.It's basically the opposite of the Hunger Games mantra ""May the odds never be in your favor"".

hi,i have this cables come with computer C13 10A-230V (0.75mm)why there power supply using C13 in first place ?they should use C19 to find cord with 2mm

### Reply 1:
C13 is the most common and easiest to find connector. Yes many computer cords using it are too thin, I've seen some as small as 18ga which is only good for 8 amps. But - the C13 is available with cords up to 16ga rated for 13amps and those are what you need.Example for North American 110vac <link> the C19 plugs/sockets are rated for higher current but are also harder to find.

### Reply 2:
i need cee 7/7 schuko - c13 16amp on amazoni can't find one!

### Reply 3:
found one finally <link>

### Reply 4:
Personally, when I have trouble finding the right plug/socket combination, I either just get a cord that has one end right (usually the C13) and then go to a hardware store and buy wire it yourself plug to match what I have on the wall to replace the one that is wrong.

### Reply 5:
These guys have some options: <link> Oh I think I see your problem. The 2mm is referring to the width so something like the European equivalent to American wire gauge.EDIT2: <link>

Topic: Creating a Hashing chip?
### Original post:
i started this out in the newbies forum but i recently got out of there so i thought here would be a better place to post.my factory has an assembly line for ic/ chips but we were doing mostly receivers, lnb/ satellite tv accessories. we grab parts from china and assemble in indonesia so we have all needed equipment to assemble. labor is cheap here and i already have an assembly line for this sort of thing. i thought might aswell make some asic miners for u all.my problem is the chip design/ acquiring the chips. anyone know a good chip designer and anyone know a rough estimate? anyone here want to help me out or knows about this sorta thing?

### Reply 1:
Read up buddy, don't do the short cut or lazy way. make an effort and read the postings.

### Reply 2:
At this point if you don't develop for at least 28nm or smaller then it really is pointless and even at that point you may get your NRE back but your customer base may not achieve ROI.

### Reply 3:
Let's see a 45nm REAL chip before asking for 28nm.....

### Reply 4:
Maybe but I am starting to think doubtful because of the development time and the NRE associated. Right now the trend seems to be die-shrinking. If it does come, I think it will likely be from the existing ASIC manufacturers who already have R&D sunk in and an existing pipeline.

### Reply 5:
NRE costs are around a couple hundred thousand to a few million dollars, depending on the chip feature size (could be anywhere from 130nm to 28nm - or you could spend tens of millions and go all the way down to 14nm).If you have that much money sitting around you can definitely do it. Otherwise you can acquire chips from companies that sell bulk chips. Bitfury is probably the best bet, since they actually have chips and are selling them, although right now raw chips are 1BTC each: <link> will be selling 28nm raw chips, you can order them here: <link>

It was $2.25M of direct cash, then admin and legal fees for a year long international merger for an SEC regulated company probably got them into $3.xxMBTCS is a publicly listed stock on OTC, meaning many of the shareholders are average people with mortgages and families to feed. Spondoolies was the one with 'rich' investors comprising of single wealthy individuals and VCs.

Bitcoin mining with GPUs is obsolete.

### Reply 2:
Although I cannot answer your question specifically, please understand that your task is completely academic.. meaning that you task will teach you, and help learn/understand the process, but not benefit you financially in any way.Please don't take this the wrong way.. I was GPU mining back when difficulty was 12 Million, and 10 GPUs would net about 1 bitcoin every two weeks... plus or minus as machines kept dying in the summer heat.. Difficulty is currently 59 Billion, 335 Million, 351 thousand, and change.., or significantly higher than my example... Today, those 10 GPUs would only net me pennies, per month.. The only benefit would be to offset the heat cost in the house, or educational.If your goal is educational, I'm sure several people on the forum would gladly donate old mining gear to you for the cost of shipping -- and you would burn far less electricity than a GPU, and be able to dive right in to Asic history.If your goal is to obtain bitcoin, it's best just to buy it.

### Reply 3:
Ohh wow didn't know the difficulty was that high :\ Guess that's the issue thenYeah I'm just doing it out of curiosity to learn, really? that would be awesome!Thanks for the info

### Reply 4:
You are mining with the wrong algorithm. In your command you have it mining with scrypt, not sha256.

### Reply 5:
Ohh okay, so this should fix it?

### Reply 6:
You can't, you can't mine SHA256d in an academic perspective. You can replace your ""scrypt"" to ""sha256"" or try blank. Not sure for that particular CGminer version, you're using a pretty old one. But you'll be making a few cents per year at most, it would take you years to reach minimum payout at a pool and you'd be using tons of electricity.I point you toward the Altcoin mining support section. You can get started with X11.

### Reply 7:
Okay, whats that?

### Reply 8:
It's an algo for Altcoins, another coin, one that can be mined with GPU perhaps profitably, depending on your electricity cost, unlike BTC.Since this is the Bitcoin-only board, i can't really elaborate on it much. I would recommend you make a thread in the altcoin section and if you want, post the link here to continue the conversation with me/us.

I took mine apart to see what was going wrong a long time ago. The 3 main caps and main fuse going into the PCB are blowing- creating the white powder.

I know what your saying, I had a small cap fall out as well. I had one almost blowout in my face.

### Reply 3:
What voltage do these thing run on and what kind of plug do you need?

### Reply 4:
They run on the standard 110-120volts, and it comes with a special 3-prong cords that plugs into a normal residential wall socket.

Duh. I mean what comes out the other side of that power supply and what kind of wattage requirements does it have? Is it 12 volts like most of the other BYO PSU ASICs?

### Reply 7:
It may have been mentioned but I wanted to show evidence and make sure people knew. Have one almost blow up in your face and you may want to warn a few people to hopefully save a fire or two I have known they burn out but the fire and exploding inside was new to me. Thats all.-D

4 out of 6 of my BFL OEM PSUs have failed. One day I came home to my entire house smelling like it was on fire. A burning plastic type smell. Sure enough, it was one of the BFL PSUs. After that I threw away the 2 working ones and bought some SeaSonic PSUs.

5770 is your best bet though you may be able to run across a used 5830. I will be selling several 5770s next week for less than $100 USD equivalent in BTC, each shipped to USA. PM me if interested.Edit: there you go, NewEgg previous post.

they seem to have a ~5%+ DOA rate, still worth it

Definitely the 5830. By far the best value for that pricerange. I just picked up 3 of them myself, as all of the reasonably priced 5850's were backordered and 5870's are nearly non-existant at this point.

no budget = unlimited funds or 0 funds?unlimited, the 6990 of course, 0 funds, whatever you have of course If you game etc, I find the 6950 1GB to be the best value, if only mining, it is hard to say.... 4* 5970 or 4* 6990 would be best on a single motherboard cost effective-wise... Used 5970 @ 400$ each would be phenomenal value. But with such high difficulty, idk if buying a rig only for mining is the smartest idea

### Reply 15:
Yeah, it's true. With difficulty jumping 60%+ this time around, and projected to jump another 50-60% the next time around, and possibly again, it'll be much more profitable to dump the monies into bitcoins themselves, and hope the value of them goes up.

if you have a sempron, no games would run well, so the CPU would be a ""bottleneck"" Think a neck of the bottle, which limits the amount of fluid the goes through.I find i5 2500K systems to be cheap for what they are also99.99$, GREAT price

RAGEEEEEEEI just bought three of those for $30 more than I needed to!I guess they'll be here two days earlier than if I had ordered them now though... 2 days of mining @ 800MH/s = 5.67 BTC = $36.87. So I guess I'm ok.

So I got an ASIC 330mh/s block erupter I set it up and started mining. All was fine inside cgminer I got a best share of like 73 so I was happy. I left this running for about 5 hours then I checked my pool and there is NOTHING it says it's inactive running 0mh/s and I have no balance. I have tried multiple pools and even diffident coins. No change

First, that block erupter is useless, you will earn nothing.Second, what pool are you mining on? It's probably because even the share difficulty is too high, lol.

SkyscraperFarms Guide to setting up a Block Erupter Cube 30-38GH/s in WindowsI spent a few aggravating hours trying to set one of these babies up. Most guides gloss over a lot of the settings. This is my attempt to help make it easier for some of you.(**) these are the areas where I had most difficulty and it seems most people did not have these issues.(*) is only pertinent to those setting up multiple cubes. If you are only setting up 1 cube, ignore these * hints.1. Tighten/re-screw heat sink screws. Every cube I received had this problem. You will need to unscrew both front and back plates. Unplug cooling fan. Carefully slide the board and blades out all together. There are guide rails that the blades may get stuck on from shifting and you may need to adjust so it slides out evenly. Make sure all screws in heat sinks are tight. Then reassemble.2. Attach to PSU. You will need a PSU with at least two 6pin PCI-E cables on it and runs at 280W, preferably more.3. Insert 30amp Fuse into Cube. I had a few fuses start to melt until I only pushed them in partially, enough to make the connection. (This only happened on high when the unit starts to get really hot, an external fan helped too<rest of post truncated>

Actually this is a group buy that needs to hit 250 units the resellers don't have the minimum order placement of 250 and it doesn't seem like we are undercutting each other, you pay the price you get the unit when it arrives no worrying about x amount of units left (except if they are all sold out).I'm not saying its a bad thing if you get enough people to do a purchase it will help you out immensely.

### Reply 6:
Yeah that's exactly why i'm offering just slightly under the re-sellers currently, I didn't want to do it but I do have to hit 250 orders minimum like tomas_s has mentioned to become an authorized re-seller. And since this is my first ever group buy I want to prove to the community I am more then capable of handling this type of task.I do appreciate everyone's input and thank this community for giving me the opportunity to sell bitcoin mining hardware.

your pricing structure put me out of reselling sticks. simple math. the other sellers offer 20 sticks for .85 each and 1 stick for .9 each. if I buy 20 sticks at .85 and sell 2 at 1.77 my profit was .07 btc. and the guy buying 2 sticks from me saved .03 btc .. your pricing of 1-20 at .88 means 2 sticks are .176 so I get no sales. I have 0 incentive to buy from ssinc in amounts of 20 sticks. while business is business you are hurting other resellers like myself which in turn will hurt ssinc , dabs and Thomas_s I never begrudge anyone trying to make a buck and I will link your post to the bitminter forum letting them know that small 2 stick sales would be cheaper with you.

Its about the current generation. Its not about being a scam, its the overall feeling about their CURRENT products which are delayed and yet to be delivered. Using your proposed logic we'd have to call BFL reputable because they delivered FPGAs.

Thanks for explanation, however black arrow also does not refund nor buyer has a right to request it. I do not know bitmine tos, so they might have same tos regarding refund request as black arrow.

They delivered lancelots and miners based on bitfury chips, so bitmine deserve the same ""yes"" as they have delivered avalon clones.

You may want to update the information for drillbit to state 'Uses Bitfury and Avalon chips'. As the current drillbit 8-board uses Bitfury chips, same with the current drillbit USB thumb.The next models are using Avalon v2 chips and it looks like they will come as a USB thumb, 8-chip board, and 16-chip board, but they aren't released yet. Honestly, I doubt many of the Avalon boards will be made, I'm pretty certain they will go either back to Bitfury (if avail) or whatever the next generation chip is/will be.

### Original post:
In regard to the last couple comments, 1.3.0 is now available...Coins can now be created, edited, and modified in Coin Manager, accessible in Settings tab -> 'Other Tools...' button menu. You can also set to not remove individual coins, even if they drop from CoinChoose. (coins used in any of your profiles are already not removed)Also notifications are displayed when new coins are found on CoinChoose, in case you want to get a head start on mining. If you don't happen to see the notification, a log entry is also created. (you can turn this off in the Settings tab)Also profile switching should once again be skipped if the profile is already in use so the miner won't be restarted.I did make some minor changes that should hopefully improve API enabling, but if you still have this issue please send me the debug report created in the Tests tab.

Oddly enough this particular code has not been changed in any recent versions.CGMiner is starting, right? CGWatcher is just not picking it up?

I'm sorry, that was a misunderstanding on my part. I didn't realize the miner actually wasn't starting (so the IsProcessAlive function was working properly). Please try 1.3.0.2, I think I have fixed this problem and a few others related to starting the miner. If this doesn't fix it, please try starting the miner using 1.3.0.2, then after it fails to start go to the Tests tab and click Create Debug Report, and email me the information displayed.

I have another small problem. When I press the button ""Disable device"", everything works fine, GPU is disabled. But when scheduler is switching profiles or miner restarts, device starts to work again, and I have to press the button again to disable the device. How can I disable the device for a long time, with using switching profiles? or it can be fixed?

### Reply 7:
Yeah that disable button applies only to the current miner process, as do any other changes in that tab. Allowing these changes to be saved to the config file (or arguments) is on the to-do list, but I'm not sure how soon I'll get to it.I would suggest instead creating a scheduled action to disable that GPU for whatever period of time you'd like, and when creating the action check the ""Persist through miner restarts..."" checkbox so it is re-applied if the miner is restarted. Hold your mouse over this checkbox to see more information on when it is or isn't re-applied.

Topic: trouble setting up solo mining with bitcoinqt and bfgminer.
### Original post:
Hi everyone,I have been trying to set up solo mining (just interested in learning how to hook up to the network) using bitcoinqt and bfgminer as advised, but I cant seem to quite get there even after searching all over the internet. I have successfully installed bitcoinqt and bfgminer, and I am pool mining with btcguild. I have made a bitcoin.conf file with the following in it and put it in the home/.bitcoin <truncated> I have no idea if bitcoinqt is running as a server when I open it...? When I try to run bfgminer in the terminal and enter the url - <link> username and password, it tells me ""pool set up failed"", also without asking me for a bitcoin address to direct mined bitcoins to.I must be doing something obvious wrong, but I just cant figure it out. I would be very grateful if somebody could point out what Im doing wrong.

### Reply 1:
the url you are using to connect to the pool that must be working and workers username and passwords must be registered on the same poolas you are using btcguild then you must enter this <truncated> as your stratum so your username and password can connect your miner on btcguild pool to start mining. so the mistake you are making is replace your localhost and port with this and try again it will start working the method which you have read to start ming is for eligius i think well try this and i hope it will be working.ping me on skype if you any questions x.c0der

HelloSorry for not providing any updates but as you know I was busy collecting email addresses from group buyers.At the moment I am working on automating payouts, that's why I need your email addresses (each participant will be able to log in to his own mining cabinet and make payouts when he want's to).I have also received tracking numbers, it should be delivered on monday according to UPS tracking system.Data center is set up, PSU's are waiting, so we are ready to go.Probably tommorow or at sunday each group buyer will receive email with further instructions and acces to his mining cabinet.How did I even missed all that new posts in this thread asking for updates...

I informed Polmine via PM to one of their forum admins.

### Reply 3:
I would recommend posting the full source code. Until then I and anyone else is going to recommend keeping this far off of any computer that has a digital currency wallet or credentials. It is simply not worth the risk.The same can and is said about any direct executable download posted on this forum.If you look through the forum you'll see plenty of posts just like yours. They usually get quickly deleted or buried in responses saying ""do not download this"".If you'd like to avoid this and get folks using your software, post the source code.

### Reply 4:
The problem is that i not have the source code.This program as not been coded by me.All that i can give you is a scan report.

### Reply 5:
Again - nobody is going to download this and I will continue to tell people not to.Just because a virus scanner doesn't pick it up doesn't mean it should be trusted. The author could easily be diverting the hashing to his own pool at a small percentage just by using the built in features in BFGMiner and cgminer.

### Reply 6:
I understand... Except that i don't have the source code then i can't modify it for redirect any percentage to my pool.Well, hope this share will make happy someone

Right, but whoever the author is could have done so. Nobody download anything you cannot look at the source for yourself. This could easily be stealing your hashrate or currency or any number of things.

Topic: KnCMiner order/shipment mess and unfairness
### Original post:
How come a company that talks a lot about fairness totally ignores the interests of most their customers?We, the majority who wasn't lucky to be in the right timezone, now have to pay for the few lucky ones got into 1-500 batch?It will be our money that should enable the mere production of ASIC devices, yet we will silently step aside to let the few gunshots reap the rewards. That's what KnCMiner call fair. I called them out with the email to give the exact estimation and placement of my order but didn't hear back. This is probably because KncMiner fair process cant be judged by a random dude from the > 500 order batch.

### Reply 1:
Just to clarify for you, You would have been in the 1-500 batch if you placed a pre-order during an approximately week long period in April after they first announced their miners (so it has nothing to do with timezone, but you're right you needed to be aware of their existence). What has happened now, is they are giving 7 days to those people with pre-orders to pay and confirm their spot in the queue. The possible unfairness is that some people placed pre-orders (at no cost) with no intention of every paying for an order and now those people are able to sell their pre-order slots at a premium. I actually don't think this is unfair, those people had the foresight to place a pre-order and now others want it so they can demand a premium. That is how a free market works. Full disclosure: I did buy a pre-order slot from someone and have placed an order with knc and I was happy to do it.

### Reply 2:
Also as someone else rightly pointed out in one of the other threads; KnC used those figures pertaining interest to coerce ORSoC on board.ORSoC wanted to be given an idea numbers of interest before agreeing to partner. Those guys and girls keen then helped KnC secure ORSoC as a partner. KnC were never going to attempt this without ORSoC on board, so there is fairness there.

### Reply 3:
Absolutely, you can't get a company like ORSoC to partner with you without demonstrating that there is a demand for the product you are developing and that is exactly what pre-orders do.I don't know why people are complaining about having to pay now. They accept credit cards via paypal, so if you are really concerned that they won't come through, that is one way to do it with minimal risk.I'll be very interested to hear the feedback after the open day tomorrow.

### Reply 4:
Yea I signed up for the newsletter on 4/09/2013 thinking ok I registered interest, HAD THEY POSTED ""Sign up here to get a place in line"" I would have but of course I thought to myself no need they aren't even taking money. ***Face Palm!***

### Reply 5:
It is still not fair when 2000 fund the development of something when 500 lucky ones get the reward.I didn't pay yet, so did not the majority, so hold on your breath you 500 gunshots, without us your order number is meaningless.I give KncMiner 6 days to let me know my order shipment estimated delivery date

### Reply 6:
I don't get the unfairness part.You could have reserved your place in april. The reservation list was open for a week.You can order now and probably be in the first 500 anyway.p.s. And I'm definitely in the wrong timezone.

### Reply 7:
Same here :-)

### Reply 8:
I registered in April on the site and for the newsletter, there was no word I should've taken the queue.Now they need to deal with their incompetence somehow, it's no good when thousands of suckers make 500 random dudes rich.Remember, without us your 500 spots are nothing

### Reply 9:
Random dudes that helped them secure a shit-hot FPGA/ASIC design house?! Bastards...

### Reply 10:
You do know the 500 are also paying customers right?

### Reply 11:
That's one way of going further - they do it like Avalon and only take money for the number of devices they gonna ship.Then do the next batch. I'm sure for the next batch the price will be lower because of the competition.I'm not paying till they clarify my shipment date.

### Reply 12:
So at the end of it, you're saying it's unfair that you didn't get into the first 500 orders? What happens if you order now and get #501?And why do you keep mentioning 2000 to fund the development and 500 lucky ones getting the rewards? According to the order page, all products will be delivered in september.

Excellent! That works perfectly.Is it possible to get the script to email me with an update of temps every hour and an email if the temperature exceeds high?Also how do I set this script to run automatically in the background and how to let me know if it's failed?Thanks a mill.

### Reply 5:
I was thinking, oh this is no problem just add one line so it sends an email.BUT this was a little bit more complicated. Because if the temp is at the $HIGH warning point, it sleeps 2 seconds and the goes on again. If I just put a mail command there it sends a mail every few seconds, probably not so good LOL.So I made a timestamp and check if it sent mail in the last 5 minutes(found that here: <link> how to make it send the ok temps every hour? I now made it log the tempsto a file, so you can make a cronjob that mails it to you every hour <truncated> I think this script had a bug, the shutdown stuff never executed becauseeven if you reach $SHUTDOWN_TEMP, the temp is higher then the $HIGH tempand so it never went into the else loop. Moved that shutdown stuff at the beginning now,so it gets checked first. But I probably created more bugs now haha You can start the script with a $ at the end, so it keeps running in the background.Maybe you have a startup script for your miners, then you can just add it at the <truncated> 1 2 3 4 <truncated> truedo for card in $CARDS; do # read temp TEMP=$(DISPLAY=:0 aticonfig --adapter=$card --odgt |grep 'Sensor'|awk -F\ '{ print $5 }'|cut -d. -f1) if<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 6:
Whoops, thanks for noticing that, of course you are right

### Reply 7:
I actually took out the high temp part and just left in the shutdown part. My room is air conditioned so if the temp is ever up to that then there's something seriously wrong and it should be shut down. My setup would not warrant clocking gpu's down for cooling.Also I used a little program called sendEmail, it allows you to send email from the command line with minimal setup (very basic). I put all my details into a second script and call it from the first. It will tell me that the temp has exceeded and it's shutting down - just so I'm aware!

### Reply 8:
Perhaps you should go to cgminer.It has control system over fan and engine clock (you can switch them or not) in order to set temperature under fixed target (by default 75C). You can define highest temp to stop mining (def. 85C) and highest temp to keep away (def. 95C).Give it a try. It's sticked in top ten.

We you on ars previously? - your setup is in my head from the pictures I have seen. Just wondering why you switched to this new pool - just had a quick browse to the site and it's looks like it's just starting off. It's hard to understand how it works though...

### Reply 3:
BAMT looks interesting but those munin plugins don't allow you to zoom in on the charts for a closer look. I find that annoying.

### Reply 4:
Yes, I was on ars previously. The DGM payout method is better because it is more like PPS in that the pool owner will cover some of the variance. Ars has also been having stability issues of late and that hurts profits.I never look at the charts. The features that are most valuable are monitoring over ssh with mgpumon, email notification of issues, being able to switch the entire farm over without changing every config and the ease of setup. It took me hours to setup a windows system. BAMT is setup in minutes.

### Reply 5:
Yeah ars has been having issues but I'm using their second server since today which has been fine. I'll have to look into this DGM method...What your saying isn't clear to me though? You say it's more like PPS because of the variance, yet, you say it's better without giving the reason?

### Reply 6:
Sorry for not being more clear.Straight PPS == the pool owner takes all of the variance riskPPLNS == you take all of the varianceSMPPS == when the pool is lucky, btc is held back for unlucky times but the pool does not share in the burden if it is very unlucky, miners must dig themselves out of the holeDGM == the variance is shared between the pool owner and miners<link> has also implemented poolserverj correctly so my stales are like .04% and they have a working implementation of merged mining which is extra profit.

### Reply 7:
I'm just trying out this yourbtc pool now, can you mine just bitcoin. I still don't know why I should care about namecoin.

### Reply 8:
Merged mining allows for you to do the same work but get paid more. Probably the one and only reason I care. yourbtc.net will automatically sell the nmc and convert it to btc for you anyway, so it's like mining bitcoin alone.

Topic: Does it sound right? Estimating the hashrate of CPU likely used to Mine Genesis
### Original post:
I am trying to estimate the cost of mining Genesis block for a research paper and wish to narrow down variables to the best i can. Here is how i got the ~8228 h/s hashrate.1- I took the difference between the block-header epoch timestamp of Genesis and block#1 which turned out to be 506,360 seconds (i.e 5.86 days).2- The nonce of Genesis Block is 2083236893 which means that satoshi proved the work on genesis block by performing 4,166,473,786 sha-256 hashing operations (2,083,236,893 nonce increments and ""Double"" sha 256 operations per nonce).Hoping the math is correct, it means that the device used for mining Genesis block performed at 8228 h/s hashrate (4,166,473,786 hashing operations / 506,360 seconds) .Is the above calculated hashrate close to the one you'd expect from CPU mining back in 2009? any notes on the math used here?

### Reply 1:
Interesting question!A quick web search reveals that people in 2011 were doing 65kHash/s on a single thread. Disconnected from Bitcoin Core though; just a simple standalone C program doing SHA256 hashes. <link> very well possible that in 2008, hashrate was quite a bit lower, maybe 10kHash/s on similar hardware; of course, satoshi may have used a laptop giving lower numbers.Your calculation does assume a bunch of things, though:[1] The timestamps are 100% correct. Problem:[2] He started hashing with nonce=0 and incremented by 1. Problem: It's not required nor enforced to do it like that. You could also generate a random number every time or maybe after 1000 iterations and count up from there.That being said, it was the very first version of Bitcoin Core and both assumptions may very well have held true back then. I'm just not 100% sure, since by today things are a lot different; timestamps are even used as a kind of 'extra nonce' and deliberately time-shifted. Just make sure since you are doing this for a research paper, that your assumptions are indeed true.PS: I'd recommend moving this to 'Development & Technical Discussion'.

It adds up, especially since Athlons and Core 2's did not have <truncated> SHA256 instructions to take advantage of, so it was most likely all coded in software (C specifically, not any assembly or even __asm__ directives).

### Reply 3:
Thanks a lot n0nce.I didn't know about the median timestamp. With that said though, and specially for the case of genesis block, would you consider those 2 factors to be almost insignificant knowing that satoshi mined genesis Block alone (no competing nodes)? Note: Am new on here, is there a way I can move the topic to ""Development & Technical Discussion"" or shall I just delete and re-post?One last thing, nonce-search tweaking/algorithm is one of the topics am very interested in, but couldn't find any good enough sources to put some algorithms to test on a Mac just for fun. any recommendation?I really appreciate the time you've taken and I learned something interesting today!

### Reply 4:
The timestamp can be adjusted forwards or backwards to the miner's will, no matter whether there is competition or not. Same with the way the nonce is selected. But I don't know why he would have done something like that. Most likely, your assumptions hold true. I'm also not aware, when exactly miners started playing with the timestamp as secondary nonce.This would be a question probably best answered by long-time miners from the Mining board, like philipma1957 and NotFuzzyWarm.On most boards, you can do it yourself just on the bottom left corner.There's even a 'Lesson' about it <link> can quickly find topics using the <link> search tool, by the way. Much better than forum search.Despite my name, I'm not an expert on nonce-search tweaking. I do understand what you're trying to do; personally I'd mostly stick to the maths and maybe write an isolated example to gather some benchmarks. But in theory, mining is a completely random process and you should not get any better or worse results in the long run whether you just count up or do something more complex.

### Reply 5:
While it may have been able to be adjusted to any value initially, the genesis block clearly states the earliest date it could have been generated.Read the coinbase sig.Alas, bitcoin rules (which means all mining) sets limits on the value it can have as stated above.As I regularly state when the subject of the 'block timestamp' comes up, the stamp is not 'the time the block was mined'It is either when the pool sent the work to the miner or what it was adjusted to by mining code (or the pool).But adjusting the timestamp is no longer required with stratum, and all pools other than those setup by n00bs who don't know what they are doing, use stratum.Stratum was designed for this reason, to put extra nonces in the coinbase sig, not use the timestamp.This u<rest of thread truncated>

Topic: Antminer S3 Keeps resetting itself
### Original post:
Good Morning GuysI wish my first post wasn't a ""problem"" post but like so many, I found your site looking for some rhyme or reason as to the behaviour of my nice new Antminer S3+ (batch 9)Set it up last night and all was good - hashing away at about 430-450 Gh/s as expected. Came to look at it this morning and is seems to be cuttin out all together, suddenly coming back to life as the right speed then 10 minutes later dropping off to zero before restarting again. This is after about 12 hours continuous running if that helps?Now, I also have an Antminer S1 running and another S3 running elsewhere, both of which are behaving as they should which rules out the mining pool. I know the configuration within the unit must be right or it wouldn't be mining at all which again, rules that out.I have this set up with an Aerocool Intergrator 600W +80W PSU (<link> using the daisy chained connector. Could this be causing an abnormal load on the PSU? Would it work better if the individual plugs were used?I am also hardwired into an Ethernet Hub so no wireless connection issues.Can anyone shed any light on this as I need to get this running properly obviously?Thanks

### Reply 1:
PSU should be ok as its a single rail so should have no issues no matter if your using one or two cables. I am wondering what the temp on the miner is getting up to? You can see the temp on the status page. You would be better to post this on the S3 thread than start a new one. <link>

### Reply 2:
Thanks for the reply - I'm in work at the moment so can't interrogate the unit but I'll try that when I get back. I have purposefully positioned it so it has a clear air path all around (I work in building services so understand that in order to maximise cooling, there needs to be open air around all sides, similar to a water to air heat exhanger).It is just baffling me why it would effectively shut off, restart and run fine for 10 minutes before repeating the process.I'll copy this into the S3 thread (didn't know it existed - oops - newbie alert )

I stopped giving a crap for a couple weeks but now I'm back and now BFL's website has actual pictures of the finished product. That means they have some chips, are assembling and testing some, and are obviously close to shipping. They might even be packaging right now. Their original statement that they later buried was that they were realistically going to ship right before Christmas. Then they said October so everyone placed their pre-orders with their company instead of their competition. Then they backpedaled and kept saying ""well, we don't know though"" and ""it might be later"" and tada, we're back at reality where we started from.Also, the Steve Jobs in that cartoon would be where he's going already if he wasn't using Apple Maps.

Topic: Looking for 2nd opinions
### Original post:
I'm looking for some second opinions about the longevity of my setup. I have 3x6970 in one rig and another 1x5870 hashing away.Current settings using cgminer on the 6970s are:950/685 (mem is lowest I can get without flashing BIOS)V=1.175 (can't adjust in cgminer or afterburner)I = 9Fan = 85% on 2 cards, 95% on the hottest cardTemp = 79C on Hottest card, 70C on coolest.Powertune = 10@ 425 m/hash eachCurrent settings using cgminer on the 5870 are:980/350V = 1.130I=9Fan = 40%Temp = 53CPowertune = 0 (Can't adjust for this card on cgminer)@405 m/hashMy questions:1) Is 950 core or 79C too much/high for the 6970?2) Is 980 core (stock 850) too high for the 5870?3) Are the fan speeds on the 6970s an issue? They are HIS 6970s.4) Most importantly, does an increased core clock affect the longevity of a card independent of temperature and voltage? I assume 53C and 40% fan to be no concern, but does a +130mhz overclock present a problem for longevity in and of itself?I'd really not like my card warranties to be voided because I leave some burns somewhere or something.

### Reply 1:
All by itself, the clock does not influence the longevity in any way.However, power consumption and dissipation rise linearly along with clock speed and those two factors are the chip killers when the microscopically small traces inside the chip ""burn up"" (actually, it's electromigration that kills them - a process where electric current displaces molecules of the conductor it's running through).Load (heat and current) also leads to degradation of transistors inside the chip to the point where they become unstable at speeds they used to run at without any issues. If your card suddenly starts crashing where it used to run stably for months dropping the clocks is the only solution.95% fan speed (or even 85%) is something you should worry about. When manufacturers cut corners, fan quality goes first. Chances are that when purchasing inexpensive 10$ case fans you are getting much higher quality devices than the ones mounted on your 300$ card...70..79C is not a bad temperature range for a battery of overclocked 6970s locked in a PC case. If it's an open rig, try increasing the distance between cards or pointing more airflow directly at them.It's a bloody damned shame that your manufture<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 2:
Thanks for the input.The voltage is strange on the 6970s -- I can't adjust voltage on any of the cards, but one is at 1.150 and the other two are at 1.175. Go figure.They are all locked in the case but I'm likely going to open the case and direct a desktop fan towards it.

### Reply 5:
that's going to have a tendancy to cause condensation and other nasty things

### Reply 6:
Why do people always get this shit backwards? If you place something cold in a warm/hot environment, the air near the cold thing gets supersaturated with water vapor and condenses on the surface. If you place something hot in a cold environment, the air near the hot thing will accept a much larger amount of water vapor compared to the environment and will NEVER condense. The worst you'll see in this setup is fog in the air.

### Reply 7:
A mining rig has mulitple temperatures throughout it's going to cause ""fog"" near the exhaust and condensation on it's cooler components. but feel free to test this and report back with video

I have nothing bad to say about Avalon personally.But it does seem to me for the great amount of business they are doing, and the great products they have, a little bit would go a long way. I'm sure in China it would be fairly inexpensive to hire a min wage dedicated secretary or customer service person to assist with running the day-to-day stuff, while Yifu and the other BTC champions can be freed up to do more important stuff. Even just having a full-time employee in this sort of role doing this one day a week would really help the situation out massively.

If you don't know the name of the country you are in, it might be hard for Avalon to deliver your unit regardless of which carrier they use.

I think it's the only way forward. They have the money, they are making a huge mark up on their bulk chips.In his recent talk at Bitcoin 2013 he admitted the team hate the customer service aspect and want to concentrate on development and engineering, that's what motivates them.That's understandable, I'd be like that too, but you can't afford to loose sight of the fact if your customers are unhappy, you don't get the funding for development and it's such an easy fix to to hire someone to make your life more efficient and rewarding and keep your customer base happy as well.

Ngzhang or yifu sure hasfamilies or relatives in china, hire these people and is common knowledge that factories bosses always prefer to hire their own family members to work for them and getting 1 or 2 person in the help desk should not be an issue.

Topic: Batch file for mining
### Original post:
Hi,This is a method to do mine hopping the way you want on Windows (tested on Windows 7 and above).The question is: i want to mine on pool x for so much time, solo for this much, on pool y for some other time and then cycle again.There problem is evident if you have only 1 hardware device, but if you have more than one device you can use Multiminer to tell each device what to mine. This kind of gives half a solution, because if you have a 10 GHs unit and a 100 GHs, you cannot split it 50-50. Also, some might say that running one device for a long period of time is/isn't equivalent to running one faster device for a shorter period of time, so the total number of lotto tickets is the same, as with time the later tickets might have less chance (point of view).Anyway, here is the code:1. Download cgminer and put it in a folder of its own, say ""cgminer-3.12.2""2. Create a batch file inside that folder, call it whatever.bat (.bat makes it an executable batch file)3. Put the code below in the file (please read it as you need to personalize it to your <truncated> cgminer.exe -o 127.0.0.1:nnn -u username -p passwordtimeout /t 120 /nobreaktaskkill /im cgminer.exe /f /s localhost /u yourwindow<rest of post truncated>

Why, Just use --load-balance and feed both pools simultaneously, you can even change the balance between the pools so one receives more shares than the other.

### Reply 2:
Hi,Thank for the feedback. With load balance and a number of miners (more than 10), 24 hrs of mining on ghash.io gave 50% duplicates. The equipment keeps jumping from one pool to another. It did not work for me...More precisely, the way i used --load-balance was by downloading Multiminer's source code from github and making some tweaks. That said, it relies on how the parameter was implemented in the software, I have not tested it myself directly in command line, just relied on feedback from the experience. I might give it a try but atm it feels better to have 100% all in one lump on one load. It's really a matter of personal decision, consider the two positions:One: i have a couple of USB miners not using anymore, I'm running them solo mining bitcoin, who knows, I might get lucky, I know the odds are probably I will find it in 800 days, and that is assuming the difficulty does not increase in 800 days, but it is better than having them making cents on cex.io.Two: if the odds are too low to win, then it is better to have them making cents on cex.io (no ad intended) rather than making nothing in solo.So the idea is, even if --load-balance was to work properly, some might not think i<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
I bought very cheap AMD Sempron CPUs. If you plan to have uses other than mining, you may want to upgrade a bit. I didn't2 GB RAM is fine if you just want the machine for mining. I have many machines with just 2 GB and they hash wellThere are several MB choices. I have personally had good luck with the ASRock 970 Extreme 4, as have others on the forum. At $99, it's decently priced for the PCIx slots it has too.I bought 1200 watt PSUs for 3 x 7970s machines they all handle the load fine. I would say no on the DVD drive. Even if you did need one to install Windows, etc. you wouldn't need to keep it attached once that's done.Cooling is something you want to keep in mind. 3 or 4 7970s in any case are going to run hot, probably very hot. Almost all of my machines are completely opened (custom frames) and have at least one PCIx-extender to raise the middle card up to allow all 3 cards to get better cooling. At about $15 (last I checked) these are worth finding and investing in on the web.

I think this is still very helpful. There are of course newer GPU's but everything else should be good.<link>

Check out the ""pics of your mining rigs"" thread: <link> are several example pics on the most recent pages as of this post: 107 & 108, and I'm sure you can find many more further back in that same thread.

Topic: Avalon 6 hardware configuration help
### Original post:
Hi guys new to this forum so hopefully im posting in the correct thread. I have (4) Avalon 6's and i want to know if powering 2 off my breakout board that has 8 pci-e 6 pin ports on it is ok? Also want to know about daisy chaining them off one controller. if i do that am i basically connecting the avalon miners together through the 2 jacks that are available on the back of them?Thanks in advance.

### Reply 1:
That should work fine two per break out board with 8 pci 6 pin plugs on the breakout boards ... what's the PSU ? ... use small fans some thing like this <link> those fans are awesome, i have a few after I discovered them. Blowing on the break out boards or the plugs might over heat and burn out ( and that can be real bad ).....So Watch those plugs at first to make sure they only get Luke warm to the touch any warmer might be bad over time and you might burn down everything .... if you use two miners per 2400 watt server PSU, which i hope you are, run that on a 220/240v 30/40 amp line not a 110/120v 15/20 amp line bad idea puling that much power off a 110/120 line .You can daisy chain up to 6 devices PER AUC, it's kind of unlimited PER RPI, the AUC is the real controller inside the the miner that runs it all ...so that's 6 per Avalon 6 .. if that makes sense ...AUC: Each AUC can connect up to 6 devices.<link> I still have one A6, I use from time to time ( I'm a hobby miner an use GPUs and Script miners, too) ..and thinking of buying one of the A741 aka A7, I'll keep calling it till they actually change to the name to some thing other then Avalon 741 aka A7 etc ...

I see many here using phoenix, and a bunch of the other ones but the one that has worked best for my 6950 is GUIminer w/ these settings:New Miner -> OpenCL -> parameters: -v -w128 f1My card cant be unlocked and I have the core OC'd to 890, default voltage. RAM is at 150mhz.It produces around 363mh/secIve tried phoenix, w/ the different kernels but it gets nowhere near that many mh/s on my card.Im running the 11.7 preview drivers for now.Please post any other miners I should try and the parameters.Thanks

### Reply 1:
im running the same miner and settings when im not using my pc, when using it i use phoenix with a aggression=6 for around 320 Mhs while watching videos. I have my sapphire OC'd to 900 and ram at default and get 365mhs (with the miner you have listed above, plus my backup pool settings.) and using 11.6 drivers

### Reply 2:
I think the only way you can get higher is to use the shader unlock mod which my non-reference sapphire can't use. I have read some of these 6950's will OC to 1000mhz but to me doesnt seem like the risk is worth the reward to OC that much.

### Reply 3:
What risk? If you can keep the card cool enough, and it runs stable, what am I missing?

### Reply 4:
Exactly, Id rather only OC it 12.5% and have it run nice and cool than push the card to its limit, make it run alot hotter and possably shorten the life span for just a couple more mhs. Therefore the reward of maybe another 10-15 mhs, to me isn't worth the risk of cutting months or years off the lifespan of the card.

### Reply 5:
If you have to balance your power consumption...these cards could potentially eat way more power when starting to modify the voltage than whats worth in mh/s output.Also, thanks guys...so Im runnin a pretty good hashrate for my card clock and configuration?

Topic: Question about pooled mining and transaction fees
### Original post:
I was under the impression that the transaction fees were also awarded to the miners. So, on the large pools (I use slush, for instance), do they just pocket the transaction fees in addition to the btc ""fee"" they charge for the block generation?What's the current transaction fee (on average) per block? Is this something to start being concerned about?

### Reply 1:
Some pools forward tx fees, most keep it.Currently tx fees revolve around 0.05 BTC which is 0.1%, I don't think they're something to worry about now. They definitely will be in the future.

### Reply 2:
sorry MeniTXN fees are increasing <truncated> is regularly receiving TXN fees between 0.1 and 0.6 BTC per block, yesterday we had a good one at 0.8935006BTC of TXN fees6 of the 24 pools listed here <link> pay out txn fees as shown on <link> fees are paying more than the Namecoin component of Merged mining on Ozcoin, I think they are well worth worrying about

### Reply 3:
TX fees are only going to get bigger, but only as Bitcoin adoption increases, not as the hash speeds increase, correct?

### Reply 4:
yes transaction fees are paid by people using Bitcoin and doing transactions, so the economy needs to expand.also Gavin recently released a patch so pools could prioritise txn fees on fee amount - something Bitcoin users had been asking for, this is partly a result of satoshidice <truncated> /hashrate is verifying the transactions and has nothing to do with the amount of txn fees

### Reply 5:
Im curious which pools keep the tx fees and which distribute them, also for LTC Im curious about the same question as there is a .1 fee for ALL transactions.

### Reply 6:
<link> is a comprehensive list of Bitcoin mining pools including who does and doesn't payout txn feesre litecoin - the alt-currency subforum is where you should be asking

### Reply 7:
Yeah Meni # are a little old. Avg tx fees are closer to 0.20 per block now. That is up from ~0.04 per block at the beginning of the year. Still small but they will be increasingly important. Say tx volume doubles and avg fee also doubles and this is after the subsidy cut goes into effect. That would make fees go from ~0.4% to ~3.0% of total compensation.

Hello,I want to set up an auto switch if the temperature is too high for safety. The idea is to switch off the miners if the temperature is over xx.How can I do this ? Also what would be the best setting to kill off the miners ? I have 35 L3+ miners on the way.Best regards,

### Reply 1:
There are digital thermometer ""AC line switches"" that will handle 15 amps - you could set one of these up on the input of your power supply.I don't recommend it though - IMO you'd be better off just reducing the clock on your miner to keep it cool as needed.Also, doesn't the L3+ have auto-adjust software like the S9 or the Spondoolies SP20 that auto-tunes it for you based on temp and stuff?

### Reply 2:
I'm not sure as I haven't received the miners yet, thanks for your answer.

### Reply 3:
You can make it with Arduino.

### Reply 4:
A managed PDU (fancy power strip) can have temperature and humidity sensors as well as providing access to switching off individual plugs to cycle the miner. You can write a small script to read these values out of SNMP and take the appropriate action if you choose, or you may find the software that the PDU comes with has a similar function.

Topic: Everybody, launch your Bitcoin client! (node)
### Original post:
We need nodes so payments can get processed!Mining isn't everything. The more people have the Bitcoin client open, the easier it is to send/receive payments -- and that benefits EVERYONE, including YOU. You send/receive payments, don't you? (to cash in your Bitcoins, if nothing else)AND the quicker/easier it is to use Bitcoin, the more users it will get -- which benefits YOU because it drives up the value (and hence, the price) of Bitcoin.

what txfee does deepbit set on it's outbound transfers? If it's putting 0 then it's going to take a long time... in fact, I sent some BTC to myself with a 0 txfee and it's still showing unconfirmed for me after about seeing 30 blocks solved... that's the way it's supposed to work.Will

If that's true, I certainly hope he goes back to his old setting.You'd think Tycho could afford .0005 per transfer at least... I mean, come on!

### Reply 7:
It's important to forward the port (8333) if you do this. Nodes which don't listen can't connect to each other and contribute much less to the health of the network especially with the influx of new users.Also make sure you're running .22 or (better) .23-rc1: the newer versions are more permissive about relaying low/no fee transactions.

### Reply 1:
With those crazy high end GPUs, the concern is dual with exorbitantly high power costs, but also drastically reducing the life of the cards, all for just a few coins. But hey, it's your cash, not mine.The only CUDA miner I know of is the RPC CUDA one that's included in GUIminer. However, the mining software itself is almost 2 years without any updates. I doubt you would get any sort of performance out of that, but it's the best you got.

### Reply 2:
Sounds like you're pretty lucky, then. Most GPUs will not last 6 years, especially ones folding or mining 24/7!This is true, but BTC mining is not ""moderate"" by any stretch of the imagination. It's essentially a torture test that we decide to run all day every day.

### Reply 3:
You can change how hard you run the cards while mining, to decrease the ""torture"". Since you're not going to produce hardly any hash, not much reason to run high stress level hashing.You can mine with anything, cgminer, guiminer, etc

### Reply 4:
Cgminer supports ocl, not CUDA. GUIminer does to CUDA (and bypasses the 100% cpu as a result) thru the RPC I mentioned, but will be slower as it has not been maintained, IIRC.

### Reply 5:
I experimented with native cuda on nvidia GPUs here at home and it performed the same speed as opencl for bitcoin mining. The only advantage I found with native cuda was I could get the CPU usage down by disabling polling in it, which you cannot do with opencl on nvidia. So in summary, just use any miner with an opencl kernel that runs on your GPU. cgminer works fine.

### Reply 6:
Mining stresses a GPU more than Boinc. Yes, I do both.

Topic: Dual card setup help
### Original post:
Hi,Long time miner, long time reader of this forum, first time posting here (thread reposted here from here)I used to have 2x6950 rig, just swapped one of the 6950s for a 7950 and am having some problems getting it running right.Problems are as follows: when all 3 monitors are plugged into the old 6950 the new card appears as ""Disabled Adapter"" in Catalyst Control Centre and is therefore automatically down-clocked to 500MHz and hashrate drops to ~250MH/s. I can get around this by connecting a monitor to it so that it appears as an ""Enabled Adapter"" but this is not ideal as it means that I need to run the memory at a more reasonable speed in order to avoid visual artefacts.I have been in the registry and disabled ULPS for the card but this didn't fix the ""disabling"" of the card, the only way I can find to get around this is to connect a screen to the card. I didn't have to do this with my old dual 6950 setup so this is quite frustrating. I have updated CCC which might be causing the problem, but I had to do this to get the new card seen by the system at all so I don't think a rollback is viable.I'm sure other people have had this problem but couldn't find anything after quite a bit <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Now that the card is mining properly I've messed around with OCing a bit and am running at 1050/300MHz core/mem, with +20% power (see above) and at stock voltage. Will run over weekend to check stability.Edit: Just to help anyone in the future following this, I used the tricks here to manage to get the clocks down to 300.I would like some advice on temps though. Setting fans to 100% gives a reasonable core temp of 78C but I'm worried about one of the VRM temps. One is down at 67C but the other is up at 97C which seems a little worrying to me. Any comments on whether VRMs can handle this kind of temp for a long time would be appreciated, and if not what can be done about it.Also, suggestions of best settings to run would be great, though this is secondary. Am currently running OpenCL miner on GUIMiner with ""-v 2 -w 256"" switches and am getting ~520MH/s with the above settings

It is a workaround for the 100% CPU bug in ATI drivers.If your rig is not effected by that bug, the workaround will not hinder anything, so one is better off just using it all the time just in case.

Quite apart from the cost side of things I do not think you will ba able to run an S7 successfully at 1000MHz?Will also depend on which Batch you have? Assuming it is one of the later 135 Chip systems I think the very highest you might go to is 900MHz and you would need to monitor the Temperatures carefully and would probably be taking close to 2KW at the wall.Rich

Topic: Probably dead chip on s17+, how to fix it?
### Original post:
Hi all.I have an antminer s17+ with some problems. First 1 hashboard did not give any signal anymore or status. a week later the second hashboard went offline.I lowerd the powersetting (3th party software) and then 1 hashboard turned back on again. So i guess that it might be the PSU because the chipcount from the systemlogs are looking fine.Im wondering if it is maybe my PSU that is broken.I dont have a second good working PSU for s17+. I do have 2x s9 PSU and a s17pro PSU. Maybe i can convert these in someway to run the S17+? I can try some things but i dont wanna risk my S17+. i also have a multimeter.Is there any way how i can check if my PSU is the problem? Or does someone have a suggestion for what could be wrong?Thanks in advance.

### Reply 1:
Kernel log, screenshots, and photos .... read this: <link> the chip didn't burn up then the board is probably repairable but might be hard to find someone to do it. If the chip burnt then it most likely damaged the pcb and then would be nearly impossible to fix.Check out this thread: <link> this thread: <link>

Topic: AMD APP SDK 2.7 performance?
### Original post:
I just noticed that version 2.7 of the AMD APP SDK was released last week. I was wondering if anyone's downloaded it, and if they've seen any performance increase/decrease when mining?I'm only using 58xx cards right now, so I doubt it'd be worth it for me to upgrade (still using 2.5). However, I plan on buying a 7970 in the near future, so I'm gonna have to upgrade when that happens, and I wonder if this is better than 2.6.Thoughts? Speculation? Personal experience?Here's the link:<link>

### Reply 1:
Tested on Linux and ATi Radeon HD 5850. AMD APP SDK 2.7 in system with Catalyst 12.4 was installed manually. Cg Miner 2.4.1. Core Peak - 750 MHz, Memory Peak - 250 MHz.Driver SDK Perfomance12.1 2.6 301.9 Mh/s12.4 2.7 298.5 Mh/s11.11 2.5 307 Mh/s

### Reply 2:
I also use CGMiner. What kernel was this? Phatk? It was my impression that if you have to use 2.6 on a 58xx card, diablo was better than phatk.The fact that it doesn't give amazing results on a 58xx cards doesn't surprise me, and it's kinda why I havn't upgraded myself. Anyone with a 7xxx card tried it out?

### Reply 5:
That's what I was looking for. So even with a 7xxx series card the new version is still slower? Is this an SDK issue, or you think it's just that current kernels are not written for 2.7?

### Reply 6:
I think it's tiny difference (~0.7%), and I'm still testing the stability of both drivers.For me, stability is more important than performance.

### Reply 7:
Why not keep the same drivers and update only the sdk? That'd give a better indicator.

I doesn't tried. Do you mean Catalyst 11.11 and AMD APP SDK 2.6 or 2.7 (libOpenCL.so.1)?

I confirm , Kano, say on ALL firmware the Cgminer problem of GPL, on my firmware to no exeption !!!

### Reply 6:
Kano is vocal about the GPL issue in almost all of the aftermarket firmware threads. Just check them and every few pages he brings it up again and again. The one exception is BoS from the folks at Slush and that is because BoS is a clean re-write of the software and is not using any cgminer code plus most of the BoS code is published as open source.As for Bitmain and other mfgr's using cgminer without posting their code, only Canaan has lived up to the source code requirements so ja BM, MicroBt and others are also in violation but pretty hard to go after them about it...

Eventually I won't be mining so I would use these outlets for tools (table saws, band saws), do they use 240v outlets?^^^^ tl,dr ^^^^I have a new house and therefore a new garage. I would like to put all my miners in said garage. The circuit breaker panel is already in the garage. I have a meeting tomorrow morning with an electrician. At that time I would like to tell him what outlets I would like. I've already talked to bge, and I can use 26000 watts. I'm planning to put all of this in the garage. Suggestions on outlets, configurations, my sanity, areas I might have issues. The goal here is safety first, looking normal second (like a heavily decked out tool room, not like Im trying to recreate a tesla experiment). If nothing else, because a year from now, I might not be mining, but I will need tools.Is there a way to make a 240v outlet, a 120v outlet? I know you can't do the opposite as the wires in the wall would melt, but I would think yo<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Why would you want to use 120V? PC power supplies can run on either. 240V is more efficient, cheaper, and puts less stress/heat on the power supplies.

### Reply 2:
Five 30A x 208/240V drops terminating with Nema L6-30r receptacles. Get Some PDUs to plug into those. Save the last 10A of headroom for some huge ass fans. You'll need them.

### Reply 3:
Ask your electrician. He will know what the local codes are and stay within them.

### Reply 4:
You don't need an electrician. Just buy a Tripplite PDU and appropriate cords for the PSUs for the 240v plug.Btw, all current, good quality PSUs can take 240v.

### Reply 5:
This is exactly what I was looking for, I think. When you say the pc power supply can be run on 240V, are you talking about using the PDUs that others have suggested or something else? I can't plug them directly in as the plug doesnt fit in the Nema L6-30r.

### Reply 6:
You use something like this to power your PSU's:<link> on the PSUs you are running will determine if you get the 10 or 15 amp version (though in truth, at 208/240v you will only need the 10amp). The Triplite PDUs are set up to use these cords and will work with any EVGA/OCZ power supply. A typical PDU can be found here:<link> it's more efficient to use 208/240 versus 120 to power your equipment.

### Reply 7:
For the same power rating, doesn't 240v takes less current from the mains than 120v? So what is the reason to use a 120v mains ?

### Reply 8:
Most PDU's have either L6-20p cords though you can find them with the C19/C20 or C14/C15 PSU style plugs. You can get L6-30 to L6-20 adapters, but they start around $35-$40 each, so if you're going to have an electrician out, I'd have him install L6-20r recepticles right next to your L6-30r's. Just watch how many amps you put on a circuit at any given time and you'll be fine. That's usually not a big deal as a 30A circuit can safely handle 30x240 (x80% for continuous load safety factor) 5,760w. That would easly handle 5xEVGA 1300G2 PSU's running 15xAntminer S3's.

### Reply 9:
Only reason is because US households are wired primarily with 120v, and (even if you have a 240v circuit) it can be difficult to get 240v power cables for your PSU's.

### Reply 10:
This is the fate we suffer for being early adopters. Back when electric service was new, the higher voltages tended to burn out the lightbulbs too quickly, so the 110/120V standard was adopted for residential power transmission. By the time engineers figured out how to make stuff that wouldn't burn out with the higher voltages, the US didn't change because there was too much infrastructure already in place.

### Reply 11:
Well US service is 240V. It is 240V split phase producing 120V between either leg and the ground and 240V between both legs. There are no 120V mains in the US (or it would be very non-standard and archaic).

### Reply 12:
You're absolutely right... I just didn't want to get into it and confuse the OP by saying, ""Well, we really are a 240V split at the center pole into 2 120V lines and a ground in your home"". That just seemed too much, so I stuck with the history lesson on why we've got 120V in our homes

### Reply 13:
You don't get 208V with a normal residential service. 208V is one leg of a 3-phase service .. usually data-center grade.What you get with a residential service is 250V split phase. That should be good enough for mining, but the data-center PDUs are not rated for it.<link> fun!

### Reply 14:
I think he was writing it as 208V/240V because it is the same exact connectors for 208V single phase and 240V. Same wiring configuration, same plugs, same outlets, same PDUs, etc. Never seen a PDU that didn't work on both 208V and 240<rest of thread truncated>

the only pools that will make a profit are those that have manufacturing linked to their business.no matter how much you try to tell people in the west to start mining. they are going to be buying the rigs from the east at a huge markup. so the west will NEVER be as competitive as the east.its already happening. for every rig sold for $1000. has an actual cost price of under $200. so for every rig someone in the west buys, they are literally giving 4 other rigs to the competition in the east.(and they 'thank you long time' for those free-bies that allow 400% competition advantage)there is no way to compete unless you are part of the manufacturing of the rigs.the solution. expand the manufacturing and get more rig manufacturers on the market. which will trickle down as more choice, and more options and also a price war on the rigs. which will result in cheaper rigs to allow for more chance of competition.EG if there are suddenly 10 manufacturers.. you will see the smart ones drop their price to $400 so that they still get a free rig, but also are still beating the competitorsbut if there remains only 2 main mining rig manufacturers, they will continue to overprice the competition an<rest of post truncated>

The Chinese still have the manufacturing edge over the west with the 16 nanometer chips. It will take time for Silicon valley to pick up the slack and even if they do this, the Chinese will just find ways to do it cheaper. They have much cheaper labor and they are more disciplined.The technology will stagnate for a while, until something new pops up and then we will rinse and repeat. The only way for the West to dominate, will be to subsidize the electricity to boost investment into Bitcoin mining and this must be cheaper than the Chinese, which will be very difficult.

Why dont they buy the blueprints?I guess it would be cheaper to buy the blueprints from them and design an equally powerful or even cheaper mining equipment in silicon valley.Technology is already stagnating, so acquiring the blueprints now is the best investment now for the manufacturers.

1. even knowing how to make it does not suddenly or magically become cheaper simply because silicon valley is involved.2. buying blueprints is meaningless. once you spent millions of dollars and months of negotiations the blue prints are already out of date because a new design has already started production by the competitor.3. no matter where you get the talent. (bitmain already has engineers from san fransisco) the physical manufacturing wont be cheaper done in USA4. it does not matter where in the world the headquarters is. the manufacturing has to be done somewhere with low labour cost, low facility costthe solution is to follow antpool(bitmains) business plan.have talent from san fran. have manufacturing in [cheap location], run the rigs in 1 hour delivery distance of manufacturing factory but have the main pool server in any country you please.i wont suggest african, indian or any of the 'stan' countries based on the heat(adding costs to keep rigs cool). looking at a non middle east country to set up. i would say the Ukraine or russia has potential. compared to america or the UK, based on labour and facility costs.ukraine has cheaper labour($0.30c /h) and also cheap <truncat<rest of post truncated>

### Original post:
Hello,I didn't find answers to my questions on the web or the bitcointalk pools forum , can you help please :I know that a pool will not send the same work to different miners . SUPPOSE there are two antminers S9i ( for example) mining on a poolSUPPOSE that the pool sends the same work to these miners and the difficulty is the same for both. -Will the miners' shares be exactly the same in this case ? (I mean with the same delays and hashes)Now suppose that the pool REsends the same work to an antminer-Will the shares be exactly the same as before ? (I mean with the same delays and hashes)Thanks

### Reply 1:
If the work generator software is coded badly and doesn't give a different stratum coinbase sig to two different miners, then they will probably mine some of the same results.If the two miners are exactly the same firmware and hardware, then giving two miners the same work will produce some of the same results.They will not always produce exactly the same results, since the two miners will not mine at exactly the same hash rate and exactly the same CPU clocks getting exactly the same time between generating internal work.But typically one would do more work and the other slower one would do a less amount of work that overlaps from the start of the faster miner.P.S. since you included the term ""Pool"" in the header. No that wont happen unless the pool doesn't know what they are doing.

Well put. If you build a new rig today specifically for mining bitcoins, then that's a gamble on bitcoin's future. Mining and selling the bitcoins immediately would take a long time to pay back the hardware at today's difficulty and bitcoin value. Mining and keeping the bitcoins might be a success though, depending on whether the bitcoin is a success.I wouldn't advise a friend to build a new mining rig today if they didn't think it was fun and wanted to take a gamble on the bitcoin. But some do think it is fun, even CPU-mining, to be part of a bit of a revolution.

Yes, if they got super-valuable, wouldn't a bunch of people sell and bring the price back down?And, if so, which would be better:A) owning a $1000 rig that produces 0.64 BTC a day.B) buying $1000 of bitcoins, or 70 BTC (at current market rate).Because I think there would be somewhat of a ""peak"", which could only be capitalized on if you had your money all at once.Yes, if you're in it for the long haul then we're not even having this discussion. Some people really want to mine -- and nothing's going to dissuade them. I personally would go with ""A"" because I don't mind the hassles of mining. It's not a get-rich-quick scheme for me.But when people say ""I mine, even though it's not very profitable, because BTC will quadruple in value in the next couple months"", they're really not thinking it through. You'd be better off buying BTC if you really believed that -- and if making money was your motivation for mining.You could always ""cash out"" when the price quadruples and then cash out and buy PC equipment if getting PC equipment is what you're after.Matthew

### Reply 13:
Thanks for that. I've been trying to say something similar, but you hit the nail on the head much better than I have. All the threads debating whether or not mining is still ""worth it"" are about as pointless as all the threads debating where the price of Bitcoin will be in a few months.

### Reply 14:
Incorrect. I can accurately say whether or not mining is ""worth it"" for me, with my hardware, day by day. I can't say whether *investing* in BTC, whether through purchasing more hardware or BTC directly is ""worth it"", but I can tell you within 10% at what price to difficulty it will no longer be ""worth it"" relative to selling the hardware. Let's just say at $.046/kwh and an expected ETA of early 2012 for ATI 7 series that day looks to be far, far away (in bitcoin time, anyway).

The stratum version needs to be able to support all the major algos, x13, x11, keccak, 256, scrypt, scrypt-n, so please make sure you're including the kernals.

Stratobitz,I believe the project I'm currently working on would suit your needs very nicely. It's a web based stratum proxy that you can control from anywhere, simply point your miners at it then switch pools with ease from any internet connected computer. For example, if you register with the username Stratobitz, you would point your miners to <truncated> and the port assigned to your account on your dashboard. From your dashboard you can add/remove pools and choose which pool your miners will connect to from an easily navigable menu. We're still in BETA, but it's been extremely stable so far and we're always looking for more people to test it out and provide feedback.Please check out our ANN thread for Miner Minder.

Topic: Better pre-order pricing scheme
### Original post:
One problem with pre-orders, is that the customers that order first, get their devices several days or weeks earlier than others, thus extract significantly more value from them.Option 1I believe that pre-orders should be priced on a sliding scale in batches based on estimated shipping day. For example, if the company estimates that they can ship 200 orders per day, then the pricing would be broken down into blocks of 200 units. The first batch would be full price, then each following batch would be reduced in price based on the estimated BTC mined per day. For example, batch 2 would be $100 cheaper than batch 1, and batch 3 would be $100 cheaper than batch 2, etc.For example, with the recent KnC orders, all customers paid $7000 for a Jupiter, but some got them on Oct 5th while others still haven't been shipped. In that time frame, there have been 2 difficulty resets which means that the early miners could have made at least 6-10 BTC more than later orders.Option 2Customers should pay a fee to get a place in line, such as 10 BTC. When it gets close to shipping time, customers would pay the remaining balance based on the date of their device shipping. The later it ships, the lower t<rest of post truncated>

Well they don't absolutely have to keep it top secret but just sell it when its in stock and ready to ship in 24hours.I would also request that in such a case limit the volume per order per shipping / billing address for the first round of stock at least so that Jabbadahut miners don't hog all the hardware and screw the hobbyists.

But when I upload bash files I get this message on execution ""-bash: /bin/updatecg: /bin/bash^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory"" This happens I believe because when I try to edit it with nano the file says converted from dos format.

Don't know anything about BAMT, butIt seems like you have a carrage return in there. So it's trying to run a shell called <truncated> Linux files are line feed terminated. Windows uses carriage-return line-feed. Make sure you remove all carriage returns before you execute the file.

To transfer a file via SSH use scp.<link> you want to transfer file ""test1.txt"" in home folder of user1 at computer1(you can put IP address here) to current folder type:Code:$ scp <truncated> .Notice the dot at the end. It means you want to copy the file in the same folder you are actually doing the command. You can also use a path like <truncated> instead.

Well I found out the problem. I was using notepad++ which although doesn't do the spaces like a default windows notepad does still does the line return windows way (with default settings). Basically it worked for bamt.conf and pools file but no other files. I guess bamt must ignore the carrier returns.

Hello! so i might get my hands on some Hydro power to power my miners with !here's the catch, the Generator needs fixing and i need to convince my friend to let me fix it and use it.but anyway, i need to build a strong case why i should be allowed to fix the generator to generate power to my miners and to the owner.The Hyndro plant it self is located in a ''Industrial park'' (i don't know what to call it) in sweden and my idea is that if i fix the Hydro power so o can use power for myself and to power the building (which is a caf, i don't mean heating but mostly lights and various machines) that its hooked up to.the owner (whom i know very very well) won't fix the generator and use the plant again because its not effective for them because the amount it would produce would not even cover 1% of their total Power use. the things i can think of that would help me convoke him to let me fix it / use it are:They would get some free power.They could earn money on it.It won't cost them anything.they will get a new ''attraction'' and show people how Power was produced back in the old days.

How much would it cost to repair it? How much power would you be able to draw? Do you have a picture with the room where the miners will be?Why do you need to convince your friend to allow you to fix it? You are doing him a service. You shouldn't try to find reasons.

### Reply 2:
the cost would depend on the generator. if its broken and my friend ( who i mine with ) can fix it it won't be expensive at all, we're 4 people who can invest in it. i would be able to draw at least 50 KwH if i'm not mistaken.the only reason i can think of that i need to convince him is thats i'm a lot younger then he his, and he's a bit old school and won't think i'll be able to fix it or that i'll just mess something up (which i won't)

### Reply 3:
This.I'm terribly confused by the story, as apparently you're willing to put in the time, material costs, etc. to fix it at no apparent expense to them.I guess if I had to look at it from their view, there may be concern that you need access to the premises - but it's your friend, right? - that there may be noise pollution while you're working on it - fair enough if that drives customers away - and that you may damage it more than repair it and selling it 'as is' might be more profitable to them - but in that case they should have sold it already.( And you addressed this last point in your latest reply, so... )

If they're generating ""Green"" Energy, regardless of how it's used (they might consider mining a waste to some extent), they could claim to be offsetting that amount of their carbon footprint. If I was you, I'd figure out how their current electricity is generated, how much carbon emissions are created per KwH by asking the utility, and then create a marketing plan detailing how much carbon emission is being offset by his company by allowing the generator to run (at no cost to him).He's probably skeptical because he knows that you are going to profit from it, and doesn't want to miss out on some himself? I also don't understand why he'd be against the idea, or what he has to lose.

### Reply 5:
I would be totally honest with him. He might want nothing or a piece of the action. Being sneaky is not the way to go, be honest and willing to let him in on the deal.

### Reply 6:
You shouldn't fix it due to this reason ""produce would not even cover 1% of their total Power use"".Sounds to me like it is a small hydro which only produce 1-2 kwh. Fixing it might be so costly that you will not generate enough power saving for the whole life of it.

### Reply 7:
You can generate 2kW with a car alternator size generator ... it's about $250 to buy a gas powered one. As log as the gear boxes are working a 50kW generator is not big and can be adapted with some professional help .. you only need to provide the right torque and RPM .. Put some pictures up with what you'll need to fix

### Reply 8:
That was the statement which caught my attention also. Sounds like its possibly just a small creek out back with relatively low flow speed and little or no vertical drop/waterfall that would allow 10kW+ power. details and photos of the actual generator are necessary

### Reply 9:
Perhaps it is a lot of work to keep it running or maybe it would disturb some nearby tenants. Maybe it is a hazard of some sort or he is afraid if you try to fix it that you will cause further damage or discover other major problems.

### Reply 10:
50kw is a lot of power and sure it can be used for 140 s3 or about 15pcs SP35sure all this will make some big noise.Drinking coffe and hearing this <truncated> not be ideal for the customers.Owner for sure must be aware and fully cooperative on anything has to do with his property.just allow him<rest of thread truncated>

Topic: Ok, this is what i don't understand...
### Original post:
I'm familiar with the mathematic principles and computer technology behind bitcoin. However, even with reading alot of the beginner's topics and other forums and such, I'm still left with a couple questions about the implementation of the currency.A few questions:1. Work done: I understand that my computer (mining at 250 Mhash/s) is chugging away to find a nonce for the hashing algorithm that yeilds a solution that fits in the current difficulty level. However my question is: As I watch the block count go up on the bitcoin client, does my computer have to start from scratch each time?? Or am I still working to find one of the predicted 2016 (or whatever it is) blocks for the current difficulty level?2. ""Accepted"": What is a Difficulty 1 hash? And when my computer ""finds"" one, is it a solution to a block that wasn't under the difficulty target, Or is it some other incremental calculation?3. Remembering: Does my solo miner remember the work it has done if I close it or my computer turns off but I get it back to work within a reasonable timeframe and before the difficulty level goes up?? I ask because the ""accepted"" number resets each time..Thanks for reading.. I would greatly appreci<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Welcome to the forum proverb. I'm kind of new as well, but have been reading as much as I can over the past couple of weeks.1. Once a block is found, the problem changes and your computer does have to change what it is looking for. This isn't a big deal because you have the same probability to hit a block so long as the difficulty remains the same.2. Accepted is the response from a pool for a piece of the work (or share) your machine has done. You will see how many shares you have completed and this number is used to compute your payout when the pool hits a block.3. Your miner will always need to check with the pool to get the latest work. There is no need to remember because your probability of hitting a block remains the same if difficulty remains the same.Hope that helps.SteveA

### Reply 2:
This is a recurring theme in all the significant conversations I have had regarding BitCoin.Some how this ""BitCoin"" system has an ""infinite"" number of ... blocks, addresses ... whatever.But if this is true how can the number of coins max at 21 bl?...Difficulty. I know.But let's say I'm running a pool that is ""big"", could I not make a full list of all block for all Difficulty levels?If the size of a block is limited than it is possible to store every block, when computers get that good(some time in the next 5 years).

### Reply 3:
There will be 21 billions of BTC awarded to miners. No more.However, block will have to be generated, forever. The miners will do that because of transactions fees.You cannot ""generate"" blocks in advance, because each new block contains some information from the previous. Your ""stored"" block would not ""attach"" to current block chain.

### Reply 4:
Currently every block generated creates 50BTC + transaction fee for the person or pool who generated it. Every 210,000 blocks (about 4 years), this is reduced by half. Until eventually creating a block generates 0BTC. The idea is when it reaches this point the transaction fees should be enough to make it worth wild for the network to keep generating blocks.I think you are missing a point. The next block in the series is based off the previous block. So if we are currently at block N, I can only compute block N + 1. I can not compute N + 2 until I know what N + 1 is. Also the difficult changes are based off the computing power of the network. We can make a guess of what the next difficulty will be, but won't know for sure until the last of the 2016 blocks from the previous difficulty is created. So it would be impossible to start generating at the next difficulty level until the previous on has ended. Basically there is no way to compute future blocks until the current block is completed.-SteveA

### Reply 5:
I can answer that.You COULD create a full list of all the solutions... in fact... that's what you are doing by mining.Miner's computers are performing millions of rounds of a cryptographic hash called SHA256. The thing is, is that the computation you are doing to find these solutions are in fact what gives bitcoin its value. There is literally no other way to do it other than these computational workloads.The difficulty is what decides ""which"" solutions are valid. This technically involves finding a solution to the hashing algorithm that falls under a certain number (determined by all the blocks before it). The ""number"" decreases over time limiting the space of possible solutions thereby making it more difficult.By design, the system slowly increases the difficulty thereby exponentially making it more difficult to create bitcoins until the system reaches the limit of the binary granularity built it which gives you the arbitrary maximum amount of bitcoi<rest of thread truncated>

There will be enough people selling the chips once they arrive, I don't see any reason anybody would pay a premium for a pre-order before it has even shipped. There's nothing to indicate that there will be much delay between, say, first order placed, and 5th order placed. Once the wafers are made and packaged, they'll all probably ship within a very short time of each other. This isn't like BFL where there's going to be months of extra wait time for every week you are back in the queue.

Topic: What makes miners work unique?
### Original post:
When pooled mining, I'm assuming every worker is using the same pool address for the reward, so thats a constant. Is the only thing that makes each miners hashes unique the timestamp + the nonce?

### Reply 1:
There are actually two nonces in mining. One is the 4-byte nonce that each miner chews through from 0 - 2^32. The other is called extraNonce and is inside the first transaction of the block, which is the generation transaction.My understanding is that whenever the miner requests work from the server, the server will change the extraNonce in the generation transaction so that that miner's work will be unique.If you look in the first transaction for a block you can see the extraNonce listed under ScriptSig.The nonce the miner found is in the block itself and in this case is 1019732465.

Still a slight issue with deepbit, not a huge one but i dont think .04btc is worth $8000 lolAlso I know this is for bitcoin pools but any chance you could pull the same info for a Namecoin mining pool?

@EpicBacon: Estimates usually aren't accurate so that's why I haven't included them for any of the pools that give that data. But if you would like the ability to see that as well I can add it as a option. Thanks for the donation BTW, those are always nice to receive @Iyeman: lol, yeah maybe someday they'll be worth that much. I just rechecked the code and I ended up multiplying the current price by your hash rate instead of how many BTC you've got. I've got a lot of files to manage for this thing and I get confused some times I'll get the fix out tomorrow with the next version.As for doing the Bitparking stuff, I should be able to do that too. How do you think the exchange tracking part should work? Would you want it to just display the NMC to BTC rate or should I calculate NMC to BTC to USD so that it basically looks the same. I supose I could do both also. Let me know you think and I'll see what I can do. I haven't bothered mining NMC's so I don't really know what stats a NMC miner is interested in

### Reply 11:
Both would be cool! If that's to much work then NMC to BTC is what i'm most interested in seeing.

### Reply 12:
It's not really an estimate. Eligius uses SMPPS (no-fee pay per share) so the value in ""block estimate"" is BTC you have already earned in the current round from pay per share. That value will never go down, it can only ever display slightly less than your current actual total (from shares you've submitted very recently that have not been accounted for) so it makes sense to include this in the total balance in your skin.Also, support for Ars Technica (another SMPPS pool) would be wonderful

Almost all firmare stock and custom are based on Cgminer, it is an open-source project under the protection of GPL (General Public License), it was meant to be open-source and people should work on improving it, but then companies like Bitmain decided they no longer want to publish the source code for their modifed version of Cgminer (BMminer).What most custom firmware devs claim to be using is the BMminer with their own modifications.The best two members who know all about the firmware ""in no particular order"" are taserz and thierry4wd, they both have their custom firmware and they would probably guide you on how to start.

Topic: LightningAsic usb miners based Gridseed GC3355 Tech Support Thread
### Original post:
Hello fellow Hashers!Can someone tell me what size the male 12V coaxial connector is on the Gridseed dual miner? The 5 chip one with the gold heat sink. I have 5 miners coming in the mail without them, so I need to make my own.Size is given in letters like size H, I, J, K, L and so on.What is it?Thanks and happy hashing!Wolfey2014

### Reply 1:
so whats the verdict was the firmware update a legit claim or what?was it just a case of a seller taking a quick snapshot of high hash rates to increase sales?

### Reply 2:
Well, from what tech support on his Skype address told me today, we are apparently getting a controller firmware update tomorrow. So I guess we'll see!

### Reply 3:
how do you download the new firmware? is it for only ppl that bought from lightingasics?

### Reply 4:
I have yet to receive my unit but I'd like to prepare.Does the controller have to be wired or does it work on WiFi? If it needs to be wired I'll have to cable up the space where I'll put it.

### Reply 5:
Not entirely sure what a controller firmware update will do. The problem appears to be that the miners can't operate at high frequencies without additional power. From looking at the usb-miner diagrams posted on GridSeed's github, their choice of voltage converter allows 4 different voltage selections for the core voltage. Once I get my miners I'll try some things out, but in theory it should be possible to increase the voltages in three different ways: 1) solder a couple pins together, 2) use modified USB miner firmware (different from the TP-LINK USB controller running the custom LightningAsic software), which will require connecting a couple pins temporarily unless you have test units, or 3) use a modified cgminer/cpuminer. It's too bad asiabtc is not including the firmware button.

Ok guys, here's a new twist in the saga...last night as I was sleeping I heard a loud pop and woke up. I smelled something mechnical/metal burning...turns out one of the silver PSUs which comes with these burned out last night. So now I've got 5 miners sitting there doing nothing...I guess I've got a couple of options...1. Option 1 - Source the same PSU from some place like Amazon. I recall someone had made a post to the exact item on Amazon but can't find it. I don't really want to do this because I've never much cared for these no-name no-warranty PSUs.2. Option 2 - Use a spare Corsair AX860 Platinum PSU I have sitting here to power all 10 of the miners. I trust Corsair and have a long warranty on that PSU.Option 2 requires knowing something about electricity, watts, amps, etc. I don't know shit about this other than the basics and/or following instructions provided by those smarter than me in this area. That being said, any one care to make a few LTC to help me with this Option 2?

### Reply 8:
Thank you.

### Reply 9:
Here is a temporary solution (or a definitive one if you don't care about mining BTC)1. uncheck BTC on the controller webpage, and save2. turn off3. wire all 10 cables to your second PSU (4 reds, 3 reds, 3 reds, 4 whites, 3 whites, 3 whites, Ground, Neutral, Phase)4. turn on, happy LTC mining In scrypt only, power consuption is low (70W total) and one PSU is largely enough.

### Reply 10:
Thanks EricKennedy...I'll give it a shot after breakfast, but I think the biggest challenge will be to try and get all those tiny wires crammed into the screw terminal.I never tried dual mining because everyone said it was very unstable...and I figured these were annoying enough to keep running for LTC alone, why compound it with trying to deal with dual-mode? Can you or anyone else confirm if this is the correct replacement PSU from Amazon? (<link> The PSU I got with the miners states: Unbranded model# S-360-12; Input 100-120V @60Hz; Output +12V - 30A

### Reply 11:
It will work.Note: If you use a standard computer PSU, you should put a load on the 5 volt line. On many PSU's that is desirable to stabilize the 12 volt line.

### Reply 12:
I am guessing that is what ""overclock"" is that will void your warranty. Using higher hash rates (in LTC mode) without changing voltage is one thing. That should not damage the miner (no thermal problem). But, overvolting can cause damage, and shorten the life. But, a few more LTC today may be worth a lot more than no LTC 1 year from now.

### Reply 13:
Thanks mate! The one I linked comes with a 1 year warranty so at least it has that going for it.

### Reply 14:
Ok, I've hooked all 10 up to the only working PSU. It was hard/tricky trying to get all those little wires crammed into the screw terminal. For those who care:Before: 2 PSUs, all 10 miners --> 108wattsAfter: 1 PSU, all 10 miners ----> 96 watts

### Reply 15:
hhhmmm sorry, but if I open this link, I see a power supply with 48V and 7.3 A. That thing does not work, to much Volt (48V)!If you<rest of thread truncated>

Topic: External heatsink on Psu
### Original post:
Mods please feel free to move this if it's in the wrong sectionJust a curiousity question really. I've got an rm1000 PSU and find its gets rather warm on the underside of the unit (opposite side to the fan) where all the sockets are. I've currently raised it with a large rectangular piece of aluminium but wondered if it was worthwhile sticking a heatsink on the bottom with a fujipoly thermal pad?What do you guys think?

### Reply 1:
Put it on a grill with the fan pointed down.The hot side will point up.Target sells a cheap grill for 8 bucks. edit > $6.49I have a link give me a minute <link> fan pointed down it pulls cooler air from below.you can try an infra red gun to find the hot spots<link>

### Reply 2:
I have that psu. And the lift from the grill. Helped. I also pointed a 20 inch box fan at three psu's sitting on that small shelf.OneLast thing the psu is noted for overheating so try keeping an eye on it.

### Reply 3:
Nice one cheers Phil. Wouldn't be able to get the grill as I'm in the U.K but I'll have a looks at similar shops when I get a chance and see what I can find. Would the heatsink work so you think or should I not bother?

### Reply 4:
Oh I do keep an eye on it. Don't want any fires lol. Its running 2xS3's at 243m so not like its massively taxed and my room is only abour 18-20c ambient so not hot in here either. Just wanted to try and prevent any issues while I can.

### Reply 5:
No need to cool the PSU. If for any reason it gets too hot, it will just shutdown.Inside a computer case a PSU intake is very hot and it doesn't have issues so with your PSU being outside in the open air shouldn't be a problem.

### Reply 6:
that psu has been know to have thermal heat failure due to not shutting down.I will find some links<link> are more. links

### Reply 7:
So just the RM750 and RM850What about CX750?

### Reply 8:
Phil is pointing you twords an amazing tool I use one similar to this more often then I ever thought I would. So nice to walk in mining area and get reads around machines and see my CFM's get maximum effect. With summer heats coming (and raising some already) I use it more and more. I'm surprised on RM series I have 2 RM1000's and they always worked fine for me no heatsinks. So not sure if made nicer then smaller ones or what. But I have had them for quite a while with good luck.

### Reply 9:
rm1000 is very good gear but it is pretty hot in one spot. I mine with it in a pc 2 r9 390's doing eth coin pulls 550 watts.case has a lot of air flow so it is all good.

### Reply 10:
Mines running 2 S3 oc'd to 243m, 2x u3 and a rbox 110 running 200m for now. Phil is bang on there's one spot that gets warm. I'm going to find a rack and mount the u3s and PSU on there with a couple of fans underneath to cool it all. Just got to find the time to get the rack and change the set up

### Reply 11:
Well finally managed to get a rack today. Had to go to the kitchen section of the supermarket 3 tier stackable wire rack. Heres the set up:-Base level under he first rack is open.First rack up has a 120mm fan on.Second rack has two U3's on.Third rack has the rm1000 (fan facing up) with the a gecko stick as the cherry on top keep cooling thanks to the rm1000 fan.The u3's and psu are staggered so the 120mm fan blows onto the u3's and half the hot side of the psu, plus the u3's draw air down from the other side of the psu. Sound ok or should I have the fan facing down on the psu?I thought hot air rises to more chance of the heat being forced out the back of the psu if the fan is facing up

### Reply 12:
I could just be lucky then I have had mine since GPU mining day's long ago. Eventually they mined asics, but that have lasted a long time. They have went through winters, summers. Mining in house and mining in a mining area.I never had a issue with all that so I still think a good gpu. Although I admit when getting PSU's later on I got the EVGA to get 1300 vs 1000. And now it's all about the server psus.

### Reply 13:
I have similar experience with Fortron 500W-750W single rail series. All of them have insufficient cooling of synchronous mos-fet rectifier, so they blow before any protection shut down the PSU. Thery also put plastic insulation sheet from one side, so overall airflow is poor. Only solution is keep load at 12V less than 80%. They have 5 year warranty so opening PSU and reworking power mos-fets and heatsink is not useful.Sometimes I buy used PSU for about 50USD and RMA my failed. They always return full price instead of repairing my PSU.

### Reply 14:
yeah running atx at 50 to 80% works for many pieces of gear.A lot of atx simply can't do 90% or more at a 24/7/365 pace.

### Reply 3:
Do you mind sharing what is inside your .bat file config?There might be another reason why it shows 0 ASIC/zombie mode.If your miner is connected directly to the PC/laptop, not on the hub with its own power your PC/Laptop is not giving enough power to your miner. You can lower the voltage or reduce the frequency to try if it's hashing then gradually increase it later until you found the best settings for <truncated> didn't work then there is official thread of this Newpac you can find it here <link> above links are not for Newpac official thread.

### Reply 4:
It's Windows so you might want to try reinstalling it in case the driver has not been loaded yet.I've never heard of Zadig, so maybe it doesn't automatically start the driver. If that's the case then go to Device Manager and start it manually.

### Reply 5:
Here is the .bat file.<link> have the miner connected to a usb hub<link> use Zadig to install the driver because that is what the official thread said to use. It has been installed twice.Thank you.

Have you replace the my_btc_address with your Bitcoin address?It seems that there issue on the driver you need windows have driver signature verification by default if you disable it the miner might work properly.

### Reply 1:

it probably because you have it on display 2 instead of 1. switch your vga cable to the second video card or switch pci-e slot

Hey steamboat,Any status on your funded development efforts? Any preliminary plans for density? I'm thinking about ordering some more chips and am curious about how your plans compare to burnin? Will your board assembly take place in the USA? Thanks,-Jay

### Reply 2:
Hey Jay,Yes, we are moving along quite nicely with board dev. I am not willing to give any initial numbers yet. Preliminary density is between 10-16 chips per board, depending on which design we go with. Board assembly is being sourced oversees and in the US, depending on lead time. Assembly will be taking place in the US as time is of the essence once the chips arrive.

### Reply 5:
I will know more this week. I have offered a solution to another member that I will open to the public:For those wishing to purchase complete rigs, I will buy/sell enough chips to complete their order depending on the amount of chips used per board. IE if you purchased 100 chips to make 10 boards using 10 chips, and we use a design with 16 chips per board, I will buy the remaining 4 chips, or sell an additional 12, to round out your order.This does not mean if you purchase 100 chips for 10 boards I will sell you an additional 60 chips to equal 10 boards.I am in the process of replying to emails and orders, I will update the thread once complete.

### Reply 7:
No offense, but 5mh/s is literally nothing in btc mining anymore. The reason your not seeing any return is because you haven't earned enough to get into a payout. You will eventually get enough and get paid out. That could be at least a week and it will equate to like one hundredth of a penny haha. If you want to see a little more earnings, spend 35 bucks on a usb asic. They will mine hundreds if not thousands of times faster than your cpu. That or you can try your luck with cloud mining on cex.io... But as far as mining btc with cpu's go it's almost pointless now.

### Reply 12:
You will get very very little mining BTC with a GPU. I highly suggest not doing it a laptop 24x7r.If you are wanting to learn you can get usb stick miners to learn it. Or go with a all in one asic miner. It really depends on your electricity price.

### Reply 13:
is their a tutorial for those programs?

### Reply 14:
Just study mining section on this forum. However, mining with a laptop is absolutely not recommended.

### Reply 15:
With Nvidia look up Cuda mining specifically.Again doing it with a laptop is a bad idea over time.

### Reply 16:
If anything maybe try to buy a cheap ASIC device if you want to mine. Mining on a laptop will cause it to heat up quite a bit which will ruin it over time. If you are set on mining with it try an alt coin not Bitcoins.

### Reply 17:
He will never make ROI with cheap ASIC machines, it's not 2012 anymore.

### Reply 18:
I would not say never it depends on his electricity price. Sure the 3 month ROI is gone most likely forever, but some with low electricity will still ROI granted it takes much longer.

### Reply 19:
Please stop, mining using GPU only wasting your power & shorten your laptop lifetime. Nvidia is not good at mining though.With today's difficulty, even small asic will hard to ROI.

### Reply 20:
It truly is sad this has been said hundreds of times, yet so many are convinced they have a laptop that beats the odds. To have Nvidia or ATI card means there is a good chance it was not some crappy laptop, and paid a decent amount for it when it was new. If they want to start slow they could get a raspberry pi and some old usb miners. Chances are 2 asic miner usb's would beat most laptop GPU's on mining BTC.

### Reply 21:
Gridseed Blades are cheap today, I think it's ok to begin, even if you want to mine for fun. Don't expect ROI

### Reply 22:
I would suggest waiting till next generation currently. A lot of people are still running gear they make very little or possibly even lose on. A2's have been king to long. No one is throwing huge R+D into Scrypt.Personally I highly suggest waiting.

Topic: lowest hashrate that hit a block in the last 3 years
### Original post:
Do any of you know how low the smallest known hashrate was that landed a block hit, say in the last 3 years?

### Reply 1:
Since we can only estimate the hash power of some mining pools and there are many unknown miners with unknown hash rate, it's impossible to answer to your question. It's possible that a solo miner has found a block with a very low hash power, but we can't know how much hash rate is owned by any of individual miners.

### Reply 2:
Do you perhaps mean what is the block that dropped the hash rate the most in the last 3 years? That's 689,472, which dropped difficulty by about 28%, from 19,932,791,027,263 to 14,363,025,673,660. Otherwise, if you're asking how many hashes it took the least to solve a block, then that's unknown. In the end, it only takes one hash to solve a block.

### Reply 3:
Earlier this year a Compac-F running 350GHs hit a block on the -ck solo pool. That low enough for you?

### Reply 4:
IIRC he had about 1.75th worth of them say five sticks.Pretty good I would say.

### Reply 5:
Actually, I hit with 9 Compac F sticks attached to a HP Omen PC... Hence the name ""TheOmen"" but nothing more than a simple Windows PC a few high power hubs and some USB miners. My total BTC farm hashpower at that time was between 8.2 - 9.2Th but the system that hit was running 9 Compac F sticks totaling about 3.4-3.6TH.

Thus you are likely the luckiest block hitter in the last 3 years.To scale the luck my mine has had 1.5ph to 2.0 ph last 3 years and we have not hit a block. we don't mine solo we mine pps and even with 200x the hash for last 3 years no block and about 1.131.035.007.23 coins to his 6.3 or so for the 1 block

They say even a blind squirrel gets a nut once in a while

### Reply 8:
Well ... every single block is found by a single miner.Each block found on each pool is also found by one account on that pool.It doesn't really mean much to say that someone with a low hash rate found a block,since in reality that is how blocks are found.Or to put it another way One of Sledge's 390GH/s CompacF ferraris found a block ... and that is a single chip miner.

### Reply 9:
How do you know your miners didn't hit any block when mining to those PPS pools? it's pretty hard to keep track unless you use monitoring software that gives you alerts when one of the miners hits a block, the miner log itself would reset with every reboot so your miners could very well have hit a couple of blocks without you knowing.

I think it is awesome someone hit with the USB stick miners! Just curious, have you added more compacs since then? Are you getting any of the new R909 pod miners?Do you have any of them mining on kanopool as well to diversify or just put them all on ckpool for a higher hash rate?

### Reply 13:
I'm currently running 40 Compac F's and 9x 2 Pacs on a private pool which is under development. I do use CK'S and Kano's pools however both as backup pools. Both are great options.I'm not running any R909's at this time. I am however running several Apollo BTC's as well as and an ever expanding number of S19 Pros. Gotta keep hope alive!!!!

### Reply 14:
That's awesome. Would love to see a picture or video of all that. What is the total hashrate with all that running?

### Reply 15:
Pi3 = 10 x Compac F's = 3.75 Th/sPi2 = 15 x Compac F's = 5.7 Th/sPi1 = 15 x Compac F's = 5.7 Th/sApollo1 = 6 x Apollo BTC (On Balanced) = 15Th/sApollo2 = 6 x Apollo BTC (On Balanced) = 15Th/sApollo3 = 4 x Apollo BTC (On Balanced) = 10Th/sApollo4 = 6 x Apollo BTC (On Balanced) = 15Th/sSingle Apollo = 1 x Apollo BTC (On Balanced) = 2.45Th/s S19APro110Th = 7 x 110Th = 770Th/sS19JPro104Th = 3 x 104Th = 312Th/sAdding this week or early next:1 x S19APro 110Th = 110Th/s6 x S19JPro 104Th = 624Th/sSo if all goes well next week I should be pushing about 1.88Ph/s

### Reply 16:
WOW! Is all of that solo mining or is any of it participating in other pools that have frequent payouts?

### Reply 17:
Currently all solo on a pool that's under development.

### Reply 18:
I have been asked to not give info out on this pool so I will say 1 thing I am pointing 1 s19 pro to his pool.

### Reply 19:
Actually I think its important to note that the pool which is under development is a joint effort between myself and another member of the forum.

### Reply 20:
possible to know if you have to hit a block, unfortunately on the series 19 they removed this information...see for yourself on the photo, obviously, it does not say if the block has been validated or even if it is orphaned One block of BTC and BHC

Topic: Using ASIC Miner Prospero X3
### Original post:
Hello everyone. I recently discovered the Prospero X3 Miner (<link> and it's performances are so high that I decided that I would start mining bitcoins! The thing is, I don't know what I'll need when it will be at home. Does it work alone like the KNC Jupiter or I simply install it's drivers to a computer and run cgminer from the computer? Also, would a windows computer work with it? Last thing, I might take a bitcoin loan from it so how long would it take to refund 4-5 bitcoins with this miner? Thanks already, James

Its a stand alone miner, so you will need an internet connection.No one knows what the difficulty will be when these will be delivered, so you can't calculate the return it will generate (if any).The Black Arrow 28nm 100Ghash Bitcoin ASIC thread.

Keep mining... when it goes back up to $266 sell em all and retire.As for it being a paperweight if you really don't want the hassle auction it off... still bet you get a pretty penny for it.I don't see the issue really but then again there is value in BTC whether it is 266 one day and $50 the next. I'd prefer to have an Avalon humming away as opposed to the few X6500's and the 7970 I put into my PC for the kids.

Maybe you should think about doing something else. If you are only in this for some arbitrary price, then I would suggest that your in Bitcoin mining for the wrong reason. Yes an incentive to keep mining is needed but this is not a get rich quick scheme. Many of us are truly committed to building an alternative currency and store of wealth. This is be a long road and this is just the start of the issues and challenges we will face. You should sit back and reflect what does Bitcoin mean to you?

It's an inductor. Do not know where you are in the world however you can find them at Digikey / ebay / amazon / aliexpress and so on.

this T9+ was working on a friends house in venezuela (I was not in venezuela by then) and to be honest I think he did not care much about the maintenance of it.. he told me one day the hash rate just drop off half. Now that I have the T9 in my hands I teared it down and noticed this issue... Actually all 3 boards are in the same condition (inductor drop off) I start thinking the problem are not the inductors, this is just the result of another bigger problem :/ please take a look of these images and tell me what you think.. thanks!! <link>

### Reply 3:
Hard to tell from just images but that looks like corrosion. They do get hot and if there were running in a humid environment that could be the issue. More resistance = more heat = more power needed = more heat. Add in some moisture that is being cooked off by the heat and generating more corrosion and it's going to pop.Unless you have just about free power you are going to loose money running a T9+Back of the napkin math at $0.02 a kwh are you are generating 0 profit. Anything above that cost you are loosing money.-Dave

You can find this component at Zeus Mining. <link> I think you need to check the T9+ hash board repair manual. The manual has instructions on the clamping circuit. If L5 falls, it is also necessary to check whether Q2, Q7, and U88 are damaged.

Take note zeusbtc is not selling 1pc their minimum moq is 20.Only buy in your local electronic shops near you to buy 2 or 3 pieces as extra if ever the first replacement is busted.Also, I do recommend to follow the instruction under link given by Rodemi under the name T9+ hashboard repair for step by step troubleshooting because it might be not inductor issue.

Topic: What's stopping companies making an actual space heater bitcoin miner for home?
### Original post:
Every time I read something about a bitcoin miner being a space heater it ends up being either a joke, or a vaporware.Is there anything fundamentally wrong for making this?, I would be happy to buy one that looked good and wasn't very noisy.For example, have a look at this great little space heater:It looks good, produces nice heat, and it's not crazy loud or annoying at all. It has 2 modes, low(750W) and high(1500W). It's a great little machine.Now, for home miners, look at something like the Apollo BTC:It also looks good, produces nice heat, and it's not crazy loud or annoying at all. It has 3 modes, ranging from around 100W to 300W or so generating about 2-3TH/s. It's a great little machine.Why hasn't anyone made a great looking space heater with something like that?You could make basically something like the Vornado, but internally instead of just having a simple heating element, you would have something like 10 times what the Apollo has. There's enough room to do that.It would run nice and quiet, produce enough heat, look great, consume about 1000W-2000W or so(configurable) and generate around 20TH/s. It would be a great little space heating machine that gives you a few sats w<rest of post truncated>

Mining gears manufacturers make more, better and easier money when selling to industrial-scale miners, they don't even make those loud 1200-1500W gears anymore, it's all 3kw and above now, they know that mining is no more a home thing, and only large farms will afford to buy a dozen miners each, so give them what they want, a large farm rather manages 10000 gears of 3.5kw than 30000 of 1200w gears, also the manufacturer rather deal with 10,000 possible warranty claims, support, and shipment that dealing with three times the number.So the majority of buyers are happy with these loud gears since they don't mine at home, the people that make them are even happier, why bother making a small miner? this will cause them many problems, 10k space heater miners will be bought by 10k people (maybe half the number of they are lucky), so instead of dealing with 1 client that can place a single order of 10k miners, you will need to deal 10k or 5k clients, many of which don't understand a damn thing about mining or/and how to set these little miners up.Also, manufacturers are bottlenecked by chips supply, labor and time, so if you have 1 million chips, 100 engs, and 3 months, it makes a lot more<rest of post truncated>

Having modded tons of different loud miners into quiet miners that will heat a home no one will buy an expensive space heater miner when they can mod a miner.Also pcs with two gpus can be quiet. they mine btc indirectly.

### Reply 3:
Yeah, absolutely right. Most experienced miners would be able to do this by tinkering with the devices themselves. There's no market for it really.And having a custom built PC for heating/mining could be a great idea as you can also use it when not mining for many other purposes.For example this enclosure for a PC would be actually perfect, and very similar to the space heater I had in mind:

### Reply 4:
I have that rig in white. with this card<link>

### Reply 5:
Yes, it is, you can get the Vornado for $150 and the Apollo for $899.99, let's assume 1000W running for 6 hours a day for 6 months at 20cents/kwh for the heater and you have an energy bill of 200$ each year, but you paid in an advance for nearly 4 years. Let's assume you will keep the Apollo nonstop for heating purposes and you've got 18$ a month ignoring power.So, why would anyone bother with these, especially since as years pass your machine will be less and less efficient compared to the newer models?Spot on, this is common everywhere and this is why in some cases manufacturers of goods do not even sell directly to the consumer, they unload all this to resellers and let them deal with a mob of shoppers that will probably encounter every single problem in the universe. One tiny fraction for the profit and you can cut a lot of personnel in support and a lot in accounting, you won't be faced with tens of failed payments, chargeback, and everything else.You can't without using air but you can reduce the noise by playing with the numbers of chips and their settings, of course, this would end with a mining machine mining at 1/3 of its capacity and not being a lot cheaper either.

hmm, I don't think the number of chips is relevant to cooling, see I am not a thermodynamics expert by any means, but my understanding is that heat is just a form of energy, so when ""electrical energy"" passes through the chips of the miner it will convert to "" heat energy"" of the same amount, so a 1000watts electrical energy will always create a 1000 joule regardless of how that ""electrical energy"" is being utilized.You are right about using more efficie<rest of thread truncated>

I've got one antminerU2 running on the latest build on a BTCGuild pool and it's doing fine. Having got one working I decided to add my 2nd unit. It showed up just like the first one and I went and added another pool with the same URL as my first pool and a 2nd worker user name. Despite all of this the 2nd unit isn't getting any work. CPU is only running at 13 of 2000 Mhz it is capable of. BTCGuild shows now work for my 2nd worker. Is there some way to assign a worker to a device? Does bfgminer spit out a log somewhere that details access errors and such to a device, or do you have to setup a redirect?

Nwoolls - saw on github that you were going to be receiving an R-Box soon to look at the issue with running it on Macs with 4.3.0.Did you get it yet? Running a VM of Windows or Ubuntu just to run the R-Boxes on a Mac is a bit of a pain. Worst case, I guess I could break out one of the RaspPi's or BeagleBones I have, but would rather not. Both platforms are pretty finnicky.

If you enable MobileMiner integration and pay for the minimal subscription at <link> there are hashrate and temp charts both farm wide, per-rig and per-device.I've considered putting something into MultiMiner and just never landed on an implementation I like.

I believe you are confusing this with the Gridseed Orbs which are able of mining both SHA256 and Scrypt. As Luke notes, I don't think the Blade is capable of dual mining.

### Reply 15:
Did some testing with an R. Pi. with 3 gridseed 5 chippers... Seems to work pretty well on this too. I've noticed though, that 2 of my miners which run at 825 and 850 <rest of thread truncated>

Topic: Possible to Swap Antminer S1 Heatsink and Fan onto Gridseed G-blade 80 chip pcbs
### Original post:
I'm just curious if anyone has tried this, I searched and didn't find anything. I'm thinking of ordering one of those 2.6mh/s 80 chip PCB's, and I have a few S1's laying around. It should be possible, even if I have to drill and tap screws, but I'm curious if anyone has the dimensions of the gridseed pcb?

### Reply 1:
Why would you want to?Or are you getting JUST the PCBs without their own HS/fan setup?BTW, it's 40 chips per board for the ""2.6 Mh/s"" (appx) boards - 80 chips was for a 2-board 2-part HS full miner setup at 5+ MH/sMy miners of that type are still packed up, but estimating from known dimentioning and measuring from the box, the part of the board that needs to have the heatsink/BIG THERMAL PAD applied is roughly 4.5"" by 10"".Note that these old miners are at best break-even if your electric cost is over about 4c/KWH.

### Reply 2:
Are you selling them?

### Reply 3:
Thinking about it, but if I move soon to the area I really WANT to be in, they'll actually be profitable (for a short while).

### Reply 4:
The reason I want one is because I have a 300w inverter on my 200w solar panel array. I have the deep cycle battery capable of running one of these for about 6 hours a day without going below 50% of the cell's capacity. Right now I'm just using a gaw fury, and I thought about one of those stick USB setups but they want 80 bucks for 500mh/s (the moonlander).If I ran this with just a single 2.6mh/s 40chip PCB, that's only about 50 watts. I was thinking I could just rest the pcb on top of the antminer heatsink.If you look here:<link> All I would have to do is set up a fan or something to blow against the heatsink, so I think this is the direction I'll go.

### Reply 5:
holes on the heatsink use a standard 92mm fan, and doesn't have to be super-high flow.Actual power usage is under 45 on all of mine, more like 40 even on the no-fan ones, using bricks I got from Zoomhash.You need to put a big thermal transfar pad between the PC board and the heatsink and screw them together - that the ONLY cooling the chips get, and they will NOT stay cool without good solid thermal contact.IMO the termal design of the ""blades"" was very very poor.Also check into the threads on litecoin talk and here about adding heat sinks to the regulator circuitry - or UNDERCLOCK the board - that was the biggest fail point on these miner boards.

### Original post:
?Its always random s3's I have 14 of them running. I ahve tried switching circuts, psu's. I dont know wtf this could be could it be beacuse I have so many switches coming off the router? Please advise this is very annoying I have to check my farm every 20 minutes.Someone else says its not the router but I have a really inexpensive 4 port asus router with 2 antennas. One of the new ones but I think they discontinued it. Someone on here said get a good switch but I dont know cisco..... Please advise I am going nuts.

### Reply 1:
cisco is a solid company. here is another switch<link> you are in the usa I have a spare and I use one with my sp20'sif you could put this in the room with the 14 miners and do 1 hard wire run to your router you could see what is the problem it my be your wireless connection to the switch.

### Reply 2:
ok i just wanted to be clear. I am not connecting wirelessly.I running all through wired connections and daisy chain switches etc all running into basic 4 port wireless router.Now if I change this setup and run from my modem to a better switch. Then run my miners into the switch and the router coming off its own line off the switch that may isolate and fix the problem?I think right now this location has like 5 unmanned small switches coming off the router. Please advise

### Reply 3:
Well if you have one flaky switch it can cause all sorts of issues on your network. I would try just one switch full for a while and see if they bomb out or not. If they run fine add another switch etc..

### Reply 4:
Reset is not bad but, please check the Router or Switch! It may solve some if not all the problem you may be experiencing. Also, when the miner is down, if you could still log into the downed miner, please take some screenshots of Miner Status Page. PM us for the screenshots. It may or may not give us some clues but may be worth a shot!

### Reply 5:
is it bad for my computers to have to reset them this many times per day? I wouldnt think so since there are no moving parts cept the fans but idrk and just want to make sure ty.will this work <link> is there someting better/less expensive?

### Reply 6:
I would advise doing proper troubleshooting and diagnosis rather than guessing and throwing parts at the problem.If you think you have a network connectivity issue, first see if you can reach the miner on the network when it's in its failed state. If you can, ssh into it and check outbound connectivity, see if DNS is working, etc.Maybe try running cgminer manually on the antminer and observe its output.

### Reply 7:
Is it all of your S3s that have the same problem? What do the status pages look like when they stop mining? Are the units on DHCP or static? What firmware are you on? If its a firmware after 1024, you will want to revert back to 1024 or the beta firmware below.Ps in the future, please try and find support in the S3 thread rather than making a new one.

### Reply 8:
they are all static and yes it is happening to any of the 14 at totally random

### Reply 9:
Before you resort to buying more hardware you can try DHCP'ing at least a few of them to see if they stay up. DHCP usually sorts a few problems out, and you can stick devices on to always retain the same IP.

Topic: Solo mining using Bitcoin Core wallet
### Original post:
Mining from Bitcoin Core walletProbably this was asked before but I can not find :Why it is not allowed any longer to solo mine directly using Bitcoin Core wallet?

### Reply 1:
Because it's a waste or resources.You can't find a block using your CPU or GPU anymore. It's beyond lottery odds.Although not simple it's that difficult to setup a pool for yourself to mine to.And there are a few solo pools out there that charge a low enough fee that it's probably better to mine there anyway.<link> is 2%<link> is 1%<link> is .5%(the above are all the solo fees, most offer regular pooled mining for a higher fee)DYOR as to which one would work better for your situation.-Dave

### Reply 2:
You can still solo mine on Bitcoin core but you will need to set up a stratum pool to be able to mine with your own pool connected in your own full node. If you are willing to make your own pool you can follow this guide here <link> only problem is that it will need time to fully sync before you can able to connect it to your pool. Why don't you just use the available pool listed from here <link> don't need to wait for too long to mine solo. Take note you can only mine Bitcoin on ASIC miner if you are planning to mine with your CPU or GPU go to the altcoin section here <link> actually your miner is?

### Reply 3:
Solo-mining is always allowed by Bitcoin Core. It'd be ironic if the official release of a Bitcoin client didn't have a solo-mining option.Open your Bitcoin Core console and type generatetoaddress <nblocks> <address> <truncated> 1 <truncated> 2000000000You won't be able to solve a block, because the difficulty is incredibly high for an average solo-miner. Try creating your own hard fork of Bitcoin and then use that for solo-mining, just to see that you're allowed to do that.

### Reply 4:
generatetoaddress can only be used on regtest which is for local testing, coins generated using generatetoaddress are worthless. The mining functionality was removed from bitcoin core in version 0.13

### Reply 5:
generatetoaddress works for me in the mainnet. I obviously haven't mined a block that way, I just hard forked it and tried with difficulty = 1.

### Reply 6:
A Lot has changed there. Solo mining is still allowed but I don't think you will be able to hit a block with a solo mining wallet. Try using solo pools they might help

### Reply 7:
Solo mining is solo mining, mining to your own private node or a public solo pool makes very little difference in finding a block.Now, having your found block confirmed by other miners so the chain is built upon it is a whole different story -- damn good chance that some pool will have a block found perhaps very soon after and because of their faster connections to the BTC network their block gets confirmed before yours shows up on the network meaning you lose an orphan race.

Image is not enough to tell the exact issue of your hashboard if you can take the whole kernel logs from the dashboard and paste it here we can analyse the logs what is the cause of this.Try any these methods below it might solve your issue.- Reset the miner by holding IP report button for 5 seconds then release.- Reconnect/reattach all PSU connectors and make sure it's properly attached.- If not try to clean the connectors with brush and thinner.- Try with known working PSU.Also, read the sticky thread because all of the solutions is already there.- Most Common Mining Issues, Read Before Making a New Post.

None of the images you uploaded open for me, it shows 403 Forbidden.Can you use this website instead <link> to upload the image?Since underclocking the miner makes it better then there are two scenarios, in which you need to troubleshoot if you really want to know the cause.1- The PSU is bad, it can't deliver enough power to all three board at high/medium settings.2- The PSU is good, but that particular hash board can't handle high frequency and voltage.The second option is more likely.

### Reply 6:
They are not open for me either. But when I try in incognito, it works fine. Not sure what is going on with that website.If you underclocked it, maybe it is now working perfectly fine on 9.5 TH/s but you made it restart unless your hashrate is under X amount (14263.45 - not sure why this number).Check options like ""Stop mining if under X"" or ""Restart miner if under X"", that is a similar feature to Vnish's one I think.

### Reply 7:
Take note that if it is overclocked it will give more heat to the hashboard so if the heat of the hashboard is higher than the maximum temp it will lead to temperature protection. Temperature protection may cause drop in hashrate or the miner might shutdown.Can you try to run the miner again with fixed fan speed of 90%?I don't know if what <rest of thread truncated>

It's been many years since I dabbled in EE&CE. Last computer I built was when a 286 8Mhz AT was the hot ticket But I already pulled the trigger on eBay so maybe pissed away a little fiat but the picuture looks correct. The term ""ATX"" came from a blogger repairing these hash boards so can't verify the accuracy. But seems to know what's up at assicbasics.com Thanks for your insight. OC

### Reply 3:
No, odds are they the ubiquitous PCIe connectors. There is no such thing as an 'ATX' connector.That said, odds are ones from ebay or other grey-market sites are crap. As long as you do not unplug/plug them more that a couple time they should be fine but will wear out after just a few mating cycles. It is far better to get power components from reputable distributors such as DigiKey, Allied, Mouser, etc. where you can choose the type and quality you want.

I am a Windows user but recently rented a Cloud VPS to run all of my various coin software/daemons. I have built Bitcoind from source, generated the server configuration file and started it, but realized I have no way to see the Sync progress as I can from the Windows GUI.I can see the file size of the blockindex.dat and blk0001.dat growing, but is there actually any way for me to see the progress from Linux Terminal?

Topic: Only 2 boards Hashing on S7
### Original post:
Can anyone help me please? Im pretty new to Antminers and am having issues. I bought this S7 nearly a year ago and since I have had it only 2 boards have been hashing. The person I bought it from hasn't been that helpful and now too much time has gone by to be able to send it back etc.So to start with I thought it had a dodgy board so sent it to Bitmain who advise it was fine.So one by one I can get the board to hash. Have tested each connection cable to each board and they all work fine. Have tested each connection point with each board and cable and all seems fine, however as son as i connect all 3 boards up, only 2 will ever work.Can the connection board be faulty? Could it be something else?Can anyone help me please? I have no idea what else to do and has been going on for so long now.

### Reply 1:
An s7 will consume between 1,250-1,350w of power. Can your PSU support that? I suspect it cannot.

### Reply 2:
I have 2 x 750's running it so don't think it's a power issue.

### Reply 3:
Actually - yes it is. Each hash board takes ~450w so that means that one supply is being overloaded. I would suspect that the board dropping out is usually one of the 2 being fed from 1 supply?And do not even think about 1 hash board sharing the 2 supplies -- THAT IS A VERY FAST WAY TO KILL A PSU as each shared supply fights the other to keep a steady voltage.

### Reply 4:
Oh, I was advised that that set up would work. I can try adding a third to it so 1 PSU per board. On that set up, so I power up the 2 boards that are not connected to the main board first and then the third one. Hadn't thought about that being an issue so hope you are correct. Thanks.

### Reply 5:
In the manuals for ALL of their miners they make very explicit mention about using multiple PSU's. #1 on their list for using smaller PSU's is only 1-per hashboard due to the issue I mentioned.

### Reply 6:
Hi, ok I have an old S2 so have taken the PSU from that and added it but still only 2 boards Hash. so to confirm, each board has its own PSU but still only 2 hash.Any other ideas?

### Reply 7:
Okay...Being rated >1kw a s2 PSU will be able to support 2 hash boards assuming there are enough PCIe plugs on it.This still usually points to a power issue. Other than asking if you have a voltmeter to actually measure voltage at the PCIe plugs, since you tried using a 3rd PSU in it for now we'll set that thought aside.Is it the same board that fails each time?

### Reply 8:
Hi, no it appears to be different depending on which port I plug the boards into. There doesn't seem to be a pattern really.

### Reply 9:
Okay, any idea what batch# it is? Or more to the point - are all the cards in from the same batch. Different ones run at different speeds. Somewhere on the Forum there is a chart of batch#/speeds. As I recall also info about it on Bitmains site.What MHz speed you running at? Tried slowing it down?

### Reply 10:
Each hash card should have a sticker on the back side (small heatsink side) that says something like 45#700 referencing the chip count and stock speed. There are also stickers that should have the order number on each board so you can verify they are the three original cards from that system.If it is not a power issue im thinking its a controller issue. Not an issue with the beagle bone itself but with the control board where everything plugs into.Also posting the kernel log would be helpful in troubleshooting this issue.

### Reply 11:
ok, 2 of the cards have 1385+ bin3 and bin1one doesnt.Currently board 2 is the one not hashing and that is bin3.The frequency is set 600.Kernal log page is blank.Should i try a different controller board?

### Reply 12:
Shall i just buy the data board then? Are they easy to swap out?

### Reply 13:
The control board is what I would say is having issues. It is an easy swap, 4 screws to take the controller/housing off, then 4 more to separate it from the housing.

### Reply 14:
Anyone know where i can purchase one in the UK?

### Reply 15:
Probably best to buy them directly from Bitmain here:<link> Bitmain Warranty. If I remember correctly they have a shop in Iceland.<link>

Topic: Antminer T9+ Problem I beg you to help.
### Original post:
Did you change the firmware and possibly load T9 firmware onto the T9+? Because the kernel log you posted is from the T9 not the T9+. The T9+ has 9 chains of 18 chips. T9 has 3 chains of 57 chips, which is what your kernel log shows it is trying to find but can't.

### Reply 1:
hello i did do that yes :F but i have since factory reseted the machine plus i have restored the bacup from before i accidently put the firmware on..is there anything els i can do?the official antminer site does not have the antminer T9+ on their website ,so all i have is the factory reset or the bacup version.or

### Reply 2:
You cant backup the running firmware, all you can do is backup the running settings. What makes you think you have a successful backup of the T9+ firmware?Im guessing you are screwed until there is a publicly available T9+ firmware out.

### Reply 3:
You're best bet is to contact bitmain's support and ask them to either publicly post the T9+ firmware on their website for download or have them send it you.Another option is to try the ""ip reporter restore"" method described here. <link> was written before the T9+ was produced, so I don't know if it will work on that model. If you do try this and it works, please post here.

### Reply 4:
I have tried all 3 resets described on that page. Nothing worked so far.While the ip report does give me the starting wokers and pools from antminer te problem does not go away nor does the firmware

### Reply 5:
Like mentioned factory reset doesn't flash the firmware back. You need to contact Bitmain.I really, really, really, wish people would stop kneejerk firmware flashing...

### Reply 6:
Thank you for all your help.I did indeed f*ck up the firmware update, but after it did not reconnect for around 1 hour, I got worried, and I started looking at solutions.What I failed to realise is that I have a T9+ model and the firmware was only for t9 model.I have contacted bitmain support asking them for a solution, either releasing the firmware, or sending it to me.If it will be send to me, I will upload it to the forum, for anyother retarded people like me.Thank you for all your help.

### Reply 7:
Sorry if that came across as rude, but people need to SLOW DOWN and read. This forum has so much information, but folks come hear and ignore it and make the same mistakes over and over.

### Reply 8:
Hehe no problem, I agree it was an idiotic move. I did read a ton before trying to flash( obviously not enough), but I just never though I need to wait 1hour for the antminer to restore connection after server ip update.Its my idiot fault for instantly trying to ""fix"" things.Now there is nothing to do but wait for antminer to release their firmware on the website, its large enough that email wont recieve it I guess ( customer support said he could not send it ), i did make some mega.nz or google drive accounts for him to upload incase he realise that waiting for bitmain before chinese newyear is gonna be a paaaain.Will see.EDIT2; Update :Bitmain just released the firmware on their site <link> Im guessing they fcked something since the file is denied, while others newly uploaded work fine ( for V-version ). Anybody able to download it ?

Topic: Best option for someone GPU mining?
### Original post:
ltc mining is most profitable at the moment, besides that you could pool hop or just mine on regular pools. Im just mining on p2pool atm and that's been going well the last few weeks.

### Reply 1:
Well I haven't been here in months and so I've missed a lot. I see that FPGA / ASIC mining has pretty much taken over now. I still have my GPU miners running. They don't make much, pays the electric bill and maybe an extra $20 for my self each month. I'm just wondering if any one can point me in the right direction as to what pool would be best for someone still GPU mining. I hear good things about p2pool. I also read that LTC is more profitable to mine than BTC at the moment but I can't see how that is with the current exchange of 1 LTC = 0.006 BTC. So basically what would be the best thing I could / should do if I still wanted to GPU mine?

### Reply 2:
Yeah I use to pool hop months ago but it kinda died off. I don't think its profitable any longer to do so with hopable pools switching their reward systems to a more hop proof algorithm. I tried mining LTC yesterday. I let it go for 24 hours. I got roughly 40 LTC @ 0.006 BTC = 0.24 BTC . With mining bitcoin I get 0.33 BTC per 24 hours. So I guess on my setup LTC isn't the most profitable.I may give p2pool a try. What would be a better pool to mine at. Currently (don't shoot me) I'm mining at deepbit. I know I've read that its the least profitable pool.

### Reply 3:
GPU mining is still going strong for me at the moment. I make $3 profit per day approximately for each of my rigs.

### Reply 4:
Is there any mining calculator for LTC?. I've got 1 5850, 11 5830 and 1 5770, do I get more by mining LTC?.

### Reply 5:
Deepbit is not the least profitable pool. It's still the most reliable, so if you leave your miners unattended for extended periods of time that could easily make it more profitable than most others.Other than that give Ozcoin a try for a few day's. I'm GPU mining and use both of those pools as well as BTC Guild. But I'm not selling my coins for a profit, I'm putting them in my mattress .Sam

### Reply 6:
p2pool seems to have worked out some of the kinks that turned me off it a few months ago. I'm running on it now and am very pleased with it. One note, I suggest running it locally, with port forwarding for 9333 (p2pool) and 8333 (for bitcoin) so that you have optimum info to work with. Theoretically that should reduce your stale rate. Lastly, keep your local version up to date. Using older versions is asking for trouble.The most popular public p2pool, p2pmining, got hacked not too long ago. The point of p2pool is to use your own resources and not rely on a public pool, that can have dishonest operators and/or be hacked.M

Most important are your results on your pool.Second comes HW errors, which is just a waste of energy. HW should be less 2%Handy little mod I made: <link> temp should be around 50 (Avalon B1 & B2) or 70 (B3). Cut off temp should be 60/80.But really, you should read the Avalon ASIC user thread from start to finish: <link>

### Reply 2:
Why aren't you overclocking? You're leaving 20Ghash on the table, around 20%Also, as far as I can tell discarded shares aren't hashed, so they don't affect your hashrate.

Topic: 7.5 cent par kwh what to start with . how much revenu does s9 do at the moment
### Original post:
HI noob here believing in the solidity of btc concept.7.5 cents (us) i approximated monthly electricity cost to 81 us dollar. how to calculate the monthly revenue of a antminer s9? what do you advice me to buy ? used maybe? what to consider , is s9 so old it wont be profitable in 2 years (not sure it would even be atm...)thanks

### Reply 1:
Antminer s9 only runs at 13.5th/s and it can pull around 1300w so I think you will make a bit of profit at the current difficulty. The profit of this unit depends on the difficulty and the current price. If you want to estimate or calculate of daily or monthly profitability of this unit I suggest you use some calculator like the one below- <link> you can use this calculator here below- <link> scroll down to the bottom and look for Electricity cost and put your current Electricity rate.

### Reply 2:
Ok thanks for the answerso it would be profitable but not for so long not even maybe before roiif one is willing to invest more for a more recent machine that will be profitable longer what would you suggest like machine that has a good proven record(not breaking) between 2k and 8k lets say usedtx

### Reply 3:
For current difficulty and price yes but if you believe that Bitcoin price will increase these coming few days the ROI decrease and daily profitability will increase. What do you mean $2k and $8k you mean that the 2nd hand unit with a price of around $2k-$8k. I can't recommend any site that selling 2nd hand units but if you are going to buy I suggest try this <link> try to contact offordscott he is active here on the forum. The daily profitability and ROI depend on the unit you buy always focus on the hashrate and the power consumption of the unit and only deal with legit sellers because there are many scammers out there selling 2nd hand units.

### Reply 4:
For used machines, you could also talk with Grace/Minerexpert there are a few reputable members here who have done deals with them with no problems, for US there is also kaboom pretty solid seller.Anyhow, 7.5 cents per kwh and S9s is really a bad idea.Right now, you know it, you're looking at at least one year of ROI if you manage to get a really good deal on some units, but the difficulty is not going to stay the same and the big guys have orders for tens of exashash for the year.The sad part, I can tell you a lot of things to not do at the moment but I would refrain from recommending gear at this point. Not with these prices.

### Reply 5:
It will be highly unlikely for a second-hand S9 to be running just fine in 2 years anyway, those gears are pretty old and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone who pays anything above zero for power, if you have free power then ROI on S9 is usually 3-5 months, which is somehow pretty safe for an old gear like that, but if you count on it to run for a year or more, you will probably regret it.With your power rate I wouldn't go above 40w/th, I wouldn't touch any of the Antminer 17 series, so that leaves you a few options, one which I can highly recommend would be M20s, it's in the 40w/th - 50$/th range, which isn't great by any means, but at least not as bad as the other newer gears.

### Original post:
Hi,I just have one quick question: Can two 850w Seasonic 80+ Gold power supplies power one antminer s7? Each PSU has 6x6+2 PCIe power cables.Thanks

### Reply 1:
No.4.73 Th/s model has a power consumption of about 1300W.You can't mix two PSU's in the same hash board, they start to ""fight"" each other, because of the voltage level differences between two PSU circuits.Here are some rough power consumption numbersOne board: 433WTwo boards: 866WAll three boards: 1300WAs you can see, two board would consume too much for your PSU, and as I said, you can't power the same hash board with two different PSUs.

### Reply 2:
I was planning one powering two boards with one PSU and the third board and controller with the other PSU. Thoughts? I also have a 1000w PSU that I can transfer from a separate computer, but that leaves the question of whether or not a 850w can power three GPUs effectively, can it? Sorry for the bother.

### Reply 3:
850W Seasonic won't be enough for two S7 hash boards. Period.I don't know exact specs of your 1000W PSU, but your 1000W PSU for two boards and 850W PSU for one board and the controller is a feasible idea.Remember that the PSU powering the controller should be the last one to be turned on.

### Reply 4:
It is a 1000w Seasonic 80+ Gold with 6x6+2 PCIe cables (at least that many I can't remember the exact amount atm), so that should work? Will a 850w be enough for three RX 470s? If not, I guess I'll return one 850w and pick up another 1000w once I make something.

### Reply 5:
Okay, yes nice. Seasonic is a good one.According to Tomshardware.com 1x RX 470 has a power consumption of about 144W with maximum load.<link> I'm guessing your PC should be fine with the 850W Seasonic.

### Reply 6:
Awesome, thank you so much for the help!

### Reply 7:
Depending how it's clocked (more specifically, what version of miner) it should be possible. I've had several in hosting that have been running off a pair of Dell 750W server PSUs, two boards to one supply and one board + controller to the other, for about a year with no issues except on the hottest days. Won't handle some of the new very-hungry S9/T9 but did stock S7s.It's also not too difficult, if you have the right tools, to undervolt an S7 for greatly improved efficiency. Low enough to run off a single 1000W PSU and still get around 4TH.

### Reply 8:
Also keep in mind that the S7 ""power requirement"" spec is ""at the wall"" using a 93% efficient PS - so the actual draw would be a little less.However, trying to power 2 hashboards from an 850 would be very marginal at best. 2 hashboard on that Seasonic 1000 and the third + miner control board + fans on one of the 850 however should work fine.

### Reply 9:
This is correct and the same as my proposition.This is good point, I used to have great time with underclocked S7 and Enermax Revolution 87+ 1000W PSU.Sidehack is the magic man when it comes to mining hardware and he has a topic for this ""underclocked S7"" subject: <link>

Yet once it drops I don't seem to be generating nothing. Like the system is still running my miner but I have 0 GPU activity at that point. If I cklick stop mining then start again everything is fine for another 20 mins. Problem does not seem to be in my flags. I think it's a program issue of some type. I have a very basic system other than the video card and 950W Power supply.Running Windows 7Can someone help me so I can get this figured out. I have been all over the forum trying to find answers and I have been trying different flags for the last 2 day's. However, same thing does not matter what flag I use I get the same results the miner continues but the GPU activity stops.BTW If you send me a personal message I will be able to<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Check your power settings in the control panel. Your system is probably set up to power down some component after 20 mins.You shouldn't need any flag in that program - I use it with default settings with my 7970 just fine.

### Reply 2:
I apologize for my ignorance but could you tell me how?

### Reply 3:
I think I've changed the power options but it has not changed anything.My mining still converts from Mhash to Khash which the khash isn't generating.Please someone help or direct me to someone that will help me get this working.Thank you

### Original post:
hi all,i have been looking at this model and would like some other opinions about it.i want to mine BTC however i cant seem to see feasibility as the numbers just dont add up..My Aim: to accumulate as much BTC for the least available pricethis is based on a 24 month periodOption #1:- Spend approx. 50k on S19s 110th (which will purchase me 7 units here, $AUD)- energy cost: 0.16c/kw- approx. monthly energy cost: $2784.00- giving me a hash rate of roughly 770over a 24 month period i would have outlaid, my initial equipment cost of $50,000.00, plus 24 months worth of energy $66,816.00, for a total exposure of: $116,816.00And based on my hash rate and some adjusted difficulty, i would have produced roughly: 2.15 BTCVERSUSOption #2:- spend $100,000 now in full and buy: 3.41 BTC- if BTC goes down, i still have 3.41 BTC, great- if BTC goes up, the value of my 3.41 BTC has increasedmy question is, based on the info above what is; my incentive to mine?over a 24 month period, it seems the Buy Now option will render me owning more BTC than mining, will not expose me to energy rate fluctuations, and can liquidate for fiat fiat faster if necessary.have i missed something in my analysis?thank you<rest of post truncated>

Take a look here for some discussion: <link> theory, with the cost of equipment, and the fact that miners do die / break so you can't be 100% you will even reach ROI never-mind generate a profit, it's a tough call.Mining is not just about generating BTC, more miners spread out all over help to keep the network running. But, small miners are really in a tough spot at the moment.Think about it before just jumping in. -Dave

### Reply 2:
Actually, this topic was in a different section, and most of the comments are from speculators who have probably never owned a mining gear, I remember we had a similar one here which I can't seem to find, that one was jam-packed with info mostly posted by actual miners, I'll post it here if I managed to find it, meanwhile OP should try to search for it, it's here somewhere.OP, this is an <truncated> question, everyone will tell you a different answer and none of them is wrong/right simply because nobody can see the future.If you were to backtest this question, you could easily cherry-pick periods were mining was better, and of course the same thing for the opposite side.However, more often than not, buying BTC at a bear market (which we are in now) was a lot more feasible than investing money in mining gears.The logic is rather simple, just look at the price history of mining gears price, electricity price, and difficulty.It won't take you much to see that mining gear values are generally in a downtrend while electricity price and difficulty are on a general bullish trend, in fact, you don't even need to look at the charts to know that, but of course, those trends have ups and down<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 3:
Seems your purpose is to know which can be more profitable for you in a long run between mining and DCA'ing. Both are profitable I would say, just depending on how you see your profit. But you should also know that most persons who can engage in mining do so at times not just because of the profit but also the technical knowledge and love they have for it, love most importantly because some factors can be discouraging but it takes a lot to continue. So I would say before you take a decision on which to do, take into consideration the love you have for each of them, and weigh your options. Nothing also stops you from doing both if it is within your means.

### Reply 4:
It was said many times before: investing and mining are 2 types of business, for different types of persons, for different mindsets. Both have their risks, both have their benefits.Some prefer the apples, some prefer the oranges, others prefer both the same; it doesn't make one better than the other.This being said, pick the one you think it's better for you.PS. Some also compare holding mined coins with holding bought coins, but that's imho a mistake in the logic.

### Reply 5:
Option #3:- Spend approx. 50k on BTC now (which will buy you approx. 1.7 BTC according to the current price)- Use the rest of the money for DCA or buy in batches when the price is goodUsing this strategy, you should be able to accumulate more than 3.41 BTC in two years, and, on the other hand, you'll be somewhat protected from price swings or if the price slumps further.

### Reply 6:
In my humble opinion mining protects you (mentally ) from the BTC/USD price drops, as long as you have very cheap electricity.You get returns during the bear market, even though they're small, but they are constant, although declining over time.Generally, not too many miners join during the bear market, so you can collect substantial bag of BTC over time.Later, when the price is high, you have the coins and the gear, which you can sell for double the<rest of thread truncated>

Topic: Open Source Bitcoin ASIC miner project that uses 2x BM1387 (Antminer S9)
### Original post:
I found an interesting project about creating your own ASIC using two BM1387 chips. The cool thing about it is that it's all open source: KiCad design files, BoM, software, etc. Basically an Open Hardware project.Github with sources here: <link> a reddit discussion about it: <link> not finished yet, but it's something interesting to have a look if you're planning to make your own ASIC miner, or you want to help create an Open Source one.Also, the person who created this is now looking to make it work with cgminer:This would be great to tinker with, specially with cgminer.

### Reply 1:
It's DIY so I'm not expecting it to be particularly fast, but do you have any hashrate figures on these self-built stuff?I'd be content if it can pump a few hundred GHash/s. It's ASIC tech after all, even USB miners with small chips can output such speeds.

### Reply 2:
Note that it's still not working properly, but based on the design, it should be able to hash around 130GH/s, which would make it similar to the NewPac USB miners, which also used a dual BM1387 setup for the hashing chips.I wonder if it's rather simple to update this design to use newer ASICs like the BM1397 like the ones used in the Compac F, or if that would require a completely new design of the board.Also the new ASICs from Intel should arrive later this year, that could potentially be a winner for DIY ASICs.

### Reply 3:
hi nullama!I saw your reply over on reddit. I'm not sure why r/BitcoinMining is deleting legit posts -- that's pretty annoying.I was banging my head the last few days as to why the bitaxe was only working erratically. I finally got it under the microscope and discovered that the pin pitch on the PCB footprint I had made was 0.03mm off from the actual chip. Doesn't sound like much, but it really looks like a few of the BM1387 pins were not making contact. I have fixed this, updated the GitHub repo and ordered some new PCBs to give it a try. I think it would be amazing to make this work with the BM1397! It looks like the BM1387 and the BM1397 have the same chip package size and pin configuration. Does anyone know if the BM1387 and the BM1397 pinout is the same?

### Reply 4:
Yeah that ~0.475mm pin pitch instead of the 0.5mm is a bit of a killer. Also no, while the footprint between BM1387 and BM1397 are the same, the pinouts are drastically different. BM1391 (S15), 1396 (*17e series) and 1397 (*17 proper) are pretty similar, and then changes were made again for 1398 (S19) to reflect a change in internal architecture but keeping most of the handy features.

### Reply 5:
That's so crazy. I carefully measured it, and then just assumed I was off and it was really 0.45mm. oops! I've ordered a v2 PCB with the footprint changed to 0.48mm -- hopefully that works. It's also a tricky DFN package because the pins don't extend all the way to the side, so you can't see if it's soldered correctly.I don't suppose you have a pinout for the BM1397? Has anyone made one of those poorly translated ""repair guides"" for the S17?

### Reply 6:
Yeah that slight pitch difference messed up early testing before we rolled out the NewPac too. Everything about that footprint makes soldering difficult. Went through three stencil aperture variants before we landed on something that would reliably deposit enough solder on the ridiculously tiny pads without putting so much on the belly pads that it would lift slightly and cause disconnects.I do have quite a bit of data on the BM1397, and you're gonna hate me for this but I'm not gonna post it, seeing as several people are currently relying on GekkoScience miner sales for income and that's the chip we're working with right now. An S17 repair guide is a good place to start though.

### Reply 7:
No worries! Thanks for your help so far. The Compac F looks really sweet, BTW. I can't help but notice there are a lot of them for sale on eBay for $300+ in essentially unopened packaging... That's the same price a 13.5TH Antminer S9 goes for. People are craving this home bitcoin mining experience.

### Reply 8:
There are some bargains on ebay! Somebody just got 2 x R606 pods, 13 x Newpacs 3 x GS Hubs 3 x PI4 a server PSU and a shed load of quality cooling for under 1000

### Reply 9:
Im glad to see the miner pricing falling a bit! Hopefully that will get this scalping that has been happening under control..

### Reply 10:
The bitaxe v2 PCBs with the (hopefully) correct footprint for the BM1387 are supposed to arrive next week. I'm really excited to try this!

### Reply 11:
I found the S17 repair guide that sidehack mentioned. I've put together a BM1397 version of the bitaxe -- the bitaxeMAX?? naming things is hard. Check it out and let me know what you think; <link> haven't gotten PCBs back to test yet, so be careful!

Topic: Best Firmware for Antminer T15
### Original post:
Hi! I'm new to mining on Sha-256! I have another machine that is for Scrypt and is mining Litecoin! So my doubt is this, I bought my first Antminer T15 (which unfortunately had some defects, but fortunately the L3+ experience helped to overcome it) now I would like to have a more complete Firmware! As I'm using Slushpool, I think BraiinOs would be the most suitable (but this option, I found a note saying it doesn't support the T15) so I tried HiveOs (which is what I use on the L3+) but when I try to flash from the error file! So I would like to ask what is the best firmware option for an Antminer T15! (if it is possible to be able to move the machine when I am away (such as on the mobile phone per application))

### Reply 1:
We can't say which firmware is the best option because they are many competitors with unique features. What exactly error do you get when flashing it with hiveos firmware? You might do the wrong procedure when flashing the miner with HiveOS?Anyway, did you check the awesomeminer? It seems they support Antminer t15 check the official thread below.- <link> you still got some error while flashing it might be a signature check you will need firmware that can bypass or remove the signature check.

### Reply 2:
Maybe Braiinos could work even if not built for T15? For example my R4 have the same control board than S9. It works on all my R4 very well.Maybe T15 have common control board than a model designed by braiinos firmware ?PS : Hey friend redditor :-)

### Reply 3:
Regarding braiinos I sent an email to confirm if it is possible to install on a T15! And thank you for the information! About Hiveos what happens is that the installation in the middle says that it is not possible to install! I got the feeling that it was blocked for some reason! Therefore, it is most likely blocked to different frimware. With this link I could unlock the machine and then install the version I want! right? I wanted a firmware to be able to control the machine for some reason, away from home! And if possible have a good auto tuning and have a manual chip tuning!

### Reply 4:
I am not aware of any ""trusted"" custom firmware made for the T15, those gears are unicorns and I suppose no dev would waste their time on it, so whatever you find is probably a hack of the stock firmware or a waste of time.What does that mean? what are you trying to achieve?

### Reply 5:
The idea would be to be able to monitor temperatures and fan speeds! I live in one where temperatures at this time of year range from 26 degrees to 34 degrees! And there are hotter days. And the firmware I have on my L3+ I can handle these things and also have options to put the machine to sleep if the temperature limits pass the desired! After that it also manages the chips, to improve performance and when possible to lower energy consumption!

### Reply 6:
you simply purchased the wrong machine to use a lot of aftermarket firmware.t17 was a better choice.

### Reply 7:
In fact, the first one I had to buy was s17! But then I saw several people complaining about the amount erros it made. So I bought a S15... as I couldn't find any at a good price, I ended up buying a T15.

### Reply 8:
Try to contact this man ""taserz"" he mostly has tools for disabling signature check and unlocking SSH. I don't if he has a tool for t15 but just try to contact him and maybe he is developing a new tool that supports T15.I think you don't know yet about flashing it through an SD card?You might be trying to flash your unit through WebGUI and receive some error?What you should do if you want a successful flashing is by flashing it through an SD card.

### Reply 9:
If your miner can't do well at 34 degrees then something is wrong with your cooling method, also, the stock firmware handles the temps just fine to a certain degree, while it does not put the miner into sleep mode it simply reboots it, so despite not being the perfect solution one would hope for - it at least ensures that the miner won't catch fire.

### Reply 10:
In the summer my mineshot aisle approaches 120fcold aisle approaches 100f or 38c

### Reply 11:
Yea! I tried by network! I will then buy an SSD to test! I saw a person changing one of the pins that are on the main board in order to install the new firmware! This is normal?

### Reply 12:
Are the home fans at 6500rpm? I have a 7500rpm one here and I could change it to be more rested! I also bought some Y splitters because I was thinking about adding two more fans and that way I had four! But I don't know how much I could spoil something by doing that because it's pulling more energy!

### Reply 13:
I don't think you will need to do that on Antminer t15 the j4 pin jumper is only for the Antminer s9 control board or any similar control board.If you are going to flash the t15 through an SD card you will need to copy and paste the firmware inside the SD card and put the SD card to your T15 mine<rest of thread truncated>

### Reply 1:
What do you mean that it keeps timing out?Do you mean that you can't access the WebGUI? Or the miner keeps restarting?If you can access the WebGUI(Access the miner through the browser) Go to kernel logs you can find it under ""system"" then copy them all and paste it to pastebin.com and share the link here or paste it here as a code(Use this button ""#"" before you post).

### Reply 3:
Can you still ping it? Maybe it dropped off your local network for some reason and got assigned a new IP address. Also, as silly as it sounds, have you tried restarting your miner and / or router?

### Reply 4:
If other browser doesn't work as suggested above try to restart the miner and then try to use incognito mode in chrome. If still doesn't work try to factory reset the miner by holding the IP button for 15 seconds. After that try to access the miner through incognito mode and setup the pool again. If all suggestion above doesn't work your modem or router might have some connection issue try to reboot the modem/router then test it again.

### Reply 5:
Try other browsers.

### Reply 6:
Oh on this note try a different ethernet cable.Blow compressed air into ethernet jacks on the miner and the switch it hooks up to.Try different jacks on the ethernet switchAlso do you have lots of gear on networkI have had up to 125 miners on 1 router and when you get to that many your issue occurs more often.

### Reply 7:
It looks like you got your network settings mixed up, you have to reset the miner to the default settings.Holding the IP report button doesn't reset the miner, it simply sends a new request to the DHCP table to get another IP, it's pretty much useless, to reset the miner it has to be powered off, and then you hold the IP report button BEFORE powering the miner on, hold that for a few seconds until you see the led flashes and then let go ( you want to keep pressing down on the IP report button throughout the whole process).If this doesn't fix your issue, there are many other things to troubleshoot but overall this is a simple problem and can be easily fixed.

Dang, I was 4 LTC away from having enough BTC to get 16 chips to build a miner but it wasn't in cards for me. My little GPU setup just couldn't mine fast enough. I got myself all worked up hoping BTC would drop enough to make up the difference Good luck to those lucky enough to get on board ASIC mining, GPU mining outlook is grim at moment with massive move from BTC to scrypt.

### Reply 2:
GUIMiner doesn't work with older versions of the OpenCL drivers. I was having the same issue (Catalyst 10.11 + SDK 2.1 with my 5830).I uninstalled all the ATI software, and installed just Catalyst 11.6 (which includes OpenCL drivers). Then GUIMiner works.The 10.10/11+SDK 2.1 method is for the command-line miners (like Diablo) only, not for GUIMiner.

### Reply 3:
I use comand line miners, but i have a problem using cat 11.6 with sdk 2.1.I dont get the sdk 2.1 to work, if i use the CLInfo i dont have OpenCl devices . With 2.3 / 2.4 it works.

### Reply 4:
Install catalyst 11.6 and use dummy plugs (or plug all cards into monitor sockets on displays like TV's, pc screens etc)

### Reply 5:
SDK 2.1 is a bit of a hassle. But I recently fixed my miner to run on SDK 2.1, and it has a GUI.

### Reply 6:
If you don't crossfire them you have to make / buy dummy plug.And before install the lastest driver and the lastest version of GUIMiner

### Reply 7:
I just went through this. I think everything that could possibly go wrong went wrong. Here are some things to do.If you have a second monitor, plug it into one of the other cards and reboot. If it becomes available, you're in luck! All you need is a ""dummy"" plug. Use the layout here and the suggestion for Radio Shack 68ohm and pics here to make one with the VGA adapters that came with your cards. One thing though: kink the end of the resistor so that it is certain to touch the walls of the adapter. I didn't do this so my dummy plugs didn't work.If it's not resolved, next, if there is a molex connector on the motherboard and you have a molex plugged into it, remove the plug. I don't know why but this made it so my MB would only see one card. Only use the power that plugs directly into the cards.If that doesn't solve it, then you are in for a bit of work. First. Take out all of the cards and put them in one at a time into each slot and reboot to ensure that the slot is working. If there are any slots that don't work, you might have a defective motherboard.After this, put in all of the cards. Install the latest drivers for your motherboard. Wipe out all ATI software and drivers using <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 8:
Catalyst 11.6B onwards doesn't need dummy plugs but there is a bug that causes load on CPU cores to go 100% which can be reduced by setting guiminer affinity to 1 CPU (but that one would still be at 100%)

### Reply 9:
I only have one monitor and I just swap the cable from one card to another and it still makes them all light up fine so I don't think this is strictly necessary.

Topic: Whatsminer firmware
### Original post:
Hello everyone! Lately, I've been noticing a lot of custom firmware for Whatsminer. Does anyone have any information on how this is done and if it's possible to create your own? If you have any information about this, please contact me.

### Reply 1:
I never heard that there is custom firmware for any whatsminer units even Braiins, awesomeminer, and Hiveon OS do not support it.Where did you find that there is a custom firmware for whatsminer?I'm sure that's a scam or infected with a virus if it was from an unknown source.

### Reply 2:
I haven't seen or heard anyone either writing custom firmware for that whatsminer(s).You can however get a glimpse into their API here: <link>

### Reply 3:
Unlike what the two fine gentlemen above mentioned, there are actually two known custom firmware for Whatsminer, Chipless, and Bixbit, the main problem with these firmware including everything else that might come out in the future, is there is actually no reason to run them and pay high fees.The stock firmware offers most of the features, you can overclock, underclock, set power limit, and submerge your miners using nothing but the stock firmware, and since using custom firmware requires a lot of trust, it's pretty difficult to find enough reviews from people who use those custom firmware versions, so most people are skeptical about using them especially that ""again"" there is really no use case.

### Reply 4:
is there a way to control fan speed of a whatsminer ?

### Reply 5:
No, it does not have a fan control even using their API you can't able to edit the fan speed but you can retrieve RPM speed through API using the Whatsminer tool under remote control.If you plan to reduce the fan speed maybe switching the settings to low power mode might help to reduce fan RPM.Or if you plan to cool down the miner a bit you can modify the miner's frequency through API.

### Reply 6:
not a good idea. I have eight units2x m102x m304x m50all of them have hot exterior that is deliberately done.all of them are long with larger fansonly two fans that do about 310cfm eachwith the long length heat sheds to outside walls of the miner.If you want to reduce fan speed try two long heat sinks on the left and right outside of the miner.thus the ability to shed heat on those walls would lower internal heat.

### Reply 7:
Using the stock firmware, no.however, there is really no reason to adjust the fan, after playing with hundreds of Whatsminers I released that the fan speed is handled perfectly unlike many Antminers ( the stock firmware to be exact). if the fans are running slow and you think the miner is getting hot, you are wrong, the miner is at the temps it wants to be at, and the same thing goes for the opposite side of the story, if the fans are running too fast, they are keeping the miner at the temps where they think it's safe.I understand you might want to adjust that on Anminter since based on my own experience all those s9s, T17 and S17 had some weird fan/temp ratio, but this isn't the case with Whatminers, in fact, I think even the custom firmware I mentioned above don't allow that, the fans can be unplugged and you tell the miner that it's going to dive into a tank for immersion cooling (it will stop checking for fans), or you let the miner control them.

Topic: To mine or not to mine
### Original post:
So i originally posted this in the newbie area because I'm new, but i figure y'all can help me more than them.I recently joined up to look into if it is possible to jump into the mining game right now since the difficulty is over 1 billion. Looking back through the years, 2009-2010 would have been great years to jump into it, but i figure better late than never. People are making money off of the mining, trade, and the creation & distribution of mining equipment. I just want to be one of those guys. now I'm new to forums but not really to the concept of Bitcoins, I have a friend who has been with it for a little while, but I was a naysayer. so my questions to all of you who are experienced are: Is it too late to jump into mining? How much would need to be spent to see a nice ROI after about 4 months? What are some good companies to buy equipment from?And lastly What are some good mining pools to mine with?Thanks for your time - SWAMP

### Reply 1:
no, it's not to late.$6000-$12000 minimum investment.Black Arrow 2TH miner ($6000) and KNC Neptune ($12000). Eligius, Btcguild, Slush... Keep in mind that there is no miners worth of buying right now and everything you can order right now will be delivered in about 2-3 months. by that time everything below 1TH of power will be worthless.

### Reply 2:
thanks for replying quickly and answering those questions. so in about 2-3 months it would the miners you listed will not be worth the initial investment?

### Reply 3:
Even much sooner if btc stays at this value.

### Reply 4:
Okay, so if in 2-3 months the miners you listed will be obsolete then how is it a good time to jump in? if i buy a miner now, ill get it by the time its no longer able to do what it is listed to do. if that happens then im back where i started back where i started.

### Reply 5:
no. you misunderstood me. BA Prospero x3 is 2TH and Neptune is 3TH. below 1TH will be worthless in about 2-3 months.in about 2-3 months miners I listed will be delivered to you (at least BA) and they will earn you nice amount of BTC. 3-4 months after that your best option is to sell them and get your self nice 5-10TH miner. we will see what will be available on the market.

### Reply 6:
My apologies, i didn't follow what you were saying, like i said im sorta new, but now i am looking into getting the $6000 one you listed due to its good reviews. thanks for your help

### Reply 7:
You can still get in on the game. But I would recommend using a site like www.coinwarz.com to compare the hash rates you would get from an asic miner with the hash you would get from a scrypt mining rig in the same price rangeAccording to coinwarz a 350kh/s scrypt rig would mine a btc in, on average, 800-1000 days before a 1 GH/s asic miner mining the most profitable asic coin (sha-256)That is if you are mining alt coins. If you would rather stick with bitcoin buy an asic from a group buy here they have the best deals.Or you could rent hashing power from someone elses rigs

### Reply 8:
what other crypto-currencies are profitable? To me it doesn't matter what kind of miner as long as its profitable and wont break the bank.A friend and I are going to split the cost of one cointerra IV, and it seems like it will be a good start. the other miners out there are out of my price range. although the KNC Neptune as mentioned above does seem nice.

### Reply 9:
When I saw the name of the thread I was sure here would be Shakespeare's fans but I was wrong.Pardon me, are you interested in bitcoin mining? don't you take into account altcoins ?

### Reply 10:
It's all relative! I mined my first block in late 2010, it took me four days (with my CPU!) and when I checked what I could do with my 50BTC all I could find was one exchange (MtGox) which was based in the US (this was before the sale, and the move to Japan) and only handled USD. And 1BTC was 5 cents or something. I suppose I wished I'd got into mining earlier... but to be honest I just thought it was an interesting experiment, and I lost interest.Fast forward to 2011, and 1BTC was - incredibly - worth more than the dollar. My poor CPU obviously wouldn't be up to the task, but I did some sums and invested in a GPU. I mined solo at first then, as difficulty rose, I mined in pools. I kept mining until GPUs became obsolete (this was long before altcoins) and then took the decision to stop mining - I could justify GPUs because I could sell them when I'd finished with them. At this point I definitely wished I'd got into mining earlier...!At this point - right now - I wish I'd invested in FPGAs and then ASICs. If I did it now it'd be a huge investment for me, with a whole bunch of risk; if I'd simply kept mining then the cost and risk would have come in manageable chunks.I guess my answe<rest of post truncated>

I lost faith in Bitmain ... 90 fays warranty and it's hard to get it.The S9 has a bad ratio of failure and looks like a bad warranty service.So I wouldn't risk any money on a R4, especially a complete new design at an overrated price.ROI is long, one failure = money lost.Short answer. Absolutely not.

I could have missed it and thanks for correction so in my case I would be at only 180 days. Need to check if my Amex is better.But frankly I really am looking to get the year warranty on this item.So if all cc's will only 2x from 90 to 180 and 180 is far from roi this poll is a waste of them. Let me look further into my other cc's.So far I found this and I will lock poll<link> of the above info indicates 90 becomes 180 unfortunately 180 days does not cut it.So basically the poll is a waste of time as I won't buy the R4 with a 180 day warranty.I would rather take my chances with another s-9.

Where did you attach the photos to? i can't see them.Anyway i think your PSU is dying and it can't run three hash boards so when you discconected one of them the miner worked fine, a faully hash board does not really cause the kernel log to report power loss.You can confirm this by swapping another hash board (the one you think is faulty) with one of the two running now.

### Reply 6:
pictures are in the quote, i will post here again <link> Q2 Measurement <link> Q1 Measurement <link> Q4 Measurements it is not the issue with PSU because power lost error message is coming only with One board I even disconnect other boards and connect only this board and error still appears, once I disconnect this specific board and reconnect the remaining two device is hashing normally so I think this board is already dead and shorted somewhere ,

### Reply 7:
Did you buy a used(2nd hand) miner?If not, then you can send them back to bitmain for repair.Can you try to check the hashboard physically and maybe there are some burnt parts under the power terminal. If not, try to clean the whole power terminal and some parts with lacquer flo thinner then try to run it again. Also, you can troubleshoot the hashboard follow the guide from here <link>

### Reply 8:
Please try hash board <truncated> looks fine.And please make a detailed(macro) photo of hash board, TOP and BOTTOM side.Maybe was repaired and voltage feedback have bad reference.

### Reply 9:
it is second hand miner I already try to clean the hash board but still didn't work , thank you for the manual I will go through it

### Reply 10:
Already tried it alone and still id doesn't work, I'm now packaging the boards to send back to china for repair thank you for your kind help

It would be pointless with bitcoin or any other altcoin that is currently worth anything.Also I am not sure you realise how power-hungry Pentium 4 era hardware is. Even if you are doing nothing related to crypto, you may achieve net profit over comparatively short term by simply building a modern computer.

You can't figure out if your miner is infected or not just by looking at the kernel log, but usually, if you can't edit the pool details it means the miner is infected, you mentioned something about not being able to change the pool details but the kernel log statesCode:01-01 19:34:23.00 E cgminer[22640]: Most likely you have input the wrong URL, forgotten to add a port, or have not set up workers01-01 19:34:23.00 W cgminer[22640]: Pool: 0 URL: <truncated> User: ......

### Reply 3:
How do you change your pool? Are you using the tool from bitmain to change the pool?Try to chanve the pool through accessing the IP webGUI then change it there.If does not work try to factory reset the miner by holding IP report button for 15 seconds then release. If its still doesn't work then try the suggestion above by flashing the unit through SD card. You can try to switch to other OS like Braiins OS temporarily to test.

Topic: Antminer S9j Hashboard missing
### Original post:
Are you sure that you are flashing it with official antminer firmware from bitmain?The kernel logs show something like ""Ooooooh you changed the clock speed... TO THE MOON!"" it seems that someone hacked your miner and replace the firmware with their own customized firmware. Can you flash it with SD card. You can follow this guide S9 series (S9, S9i, S9j, S9 Hydro) Control Board Program RecoveryThen flash it with this firmware instead of s9j flash it with s9 firmware <truncated> in webGUI. After that test, it again for 30 minutes if it doesn't work post the new kernel logs here. You can also try the Braiins OS to test if your 3rd hashboard if its totally dead or not.

### Reply 1:
Nice catch, couldn't see that at first glance.Anyhow just to make OP's life easier, in most cases a simple reset will be enough to get rid of the hacked firmware, but there is a trick that needs to be done while resetting.1-Use the IP-report to reset the the miner.2-Flash a new firmware right away , you have only a few seconds to do so, the flash will fail if you take more than 20-30 seconds to hit that upgrade button, so make sure you prepare everything in advance so that you can perform the flash as quickly as possible.

### Reply 3:
Cheesy. I wonder what else does this firmware does? It would be interesting to inspect bmminer.confI would go the Braiins OS route, but in any case not only you need to restore the firmware, but also set up a password... Preferably from a non tainted PC (ie. not the Windows pc that installed the malware, lol).Unless this is one of the known firmware mods and was installed willingly by the owner or former owner.

### Reply 4:
I do not believe that my miners are infected with malicious virus, since i've used official bitmain firmware and bmminer from tazers: <link> saw that TO THE MOON message in kernel log on all of my miners but i was sure that tazers left that message in there. It would be great if someone who also clocked them had the same kernel log messages just to confirm

### Reply 5:
What frequency and voltage did you set it at? Genuinely curious as I have some s9's running at 18th/s for the past year. Most of mine run at 16th or 17th to keep things on the safer side.

### Reply 6:
If you use the multi-option firmware from May 2019 you will be able to switch between many efficiency settings, and it will autotune rather than forcing you to set voltage and freq manually for each miner/hashboard.

### Reply 7:
And lock you out of your miner removing ssh access and chance for trying other firmwares... Thanks but no thanks. Avoid Bitmain's 2019 firmware like the plague.

### Reply 8:
I just texted taserz on telegram and he did confirm that this line is in his firmware (he checked the code)So it does not seem like your gear is hacked anymore, but the best way to confirm would be checking the hashrate on the pool, if the average 24 hrs are similar on both the pool and the miner GUI then you are good.but now that you mentioned about using taserz's firmware, it is safe to assume that you tried to overclock your gear and you got that board toasted , what setting you had on it and what was the temp?

### Reply 9:
Oh.. I see...I agree with mikeywith it's possible that your hashboard is dead due to overclocking(like the other said overclocking is always reducing the lifespan of the miner) if you continue to run the miner at the full capacity other hashboard will be dead just like what happened to Chain[J8]. Known issue of moded bmminer of taserz according to the thraed ""Hashboard do not report temps"" so there is a possibility that the Chain[J8] is overheated.Did you try the method that I provided above?

### Original post:
Generally, shipping will be handled the way buyer wants, i.e. he decides the courier of choice, insurance, economy / express, etc. Obviously problems with shipping are outside of my control, i.e. if someone asks his device to be shipped to Syria, I won't refuse but also won't take responsibility.As for the price: exchange rate got a little bit volatile recently, so risk is high it to be lower on Monday. But as described, you are going to pay exactly what I am charged for (BitPay total / 100 per unit). The delta is returned to sender.

### Reply 6:
As written in OP, when KnC first announced, their products were priced somewhere at $3k. with a exchange rate of $200+, 100 units totaled at 1.5k BTC - thats the amount I am still putting at risk.The 3 unit limit was not there when I pre-ordered. It might have been introduced lately, but from the order system I am able to checkout all 100 (see screenshot in OP).Yes, this is risky. I guess KnC collected already several millions, and it will be a sad day for the community if they fail - which is btw the case for all other ASIC manufacturers.

### Reply 7:
Is there any sort of discount for those wanting KnC to host it?

### Reply 8:
What about making a group buy for 5-10 Jupiters with hosting at KNC (or at your place) and dividing each device to 5-10 shares? I think many members would be interested. I know there many group buys like this but not every OP of these is as trustworthy as you

### Reply 9:
Would you be willing to provide the option of KnC hosting the device? That seems to be a deciding factor for some.

### Reply 10:
There is not much information about hosting so far, but since KnC offers to change your mind and ship devices you initially ordered for hosting, I am fine with this.Update: Device HostingSince several users approached me with their preference for hosting instead of shipping Jupiter units, and since KnC allows devices ordered for hosting to be changed to ship afterwards, if we make it to order I will do with all devices ordered for hosting and change it to shipping in a later step.

The exact ToS for hosting are not yet finalized, the most recent information is from <link> expect and will let KnC confirm that it will be possible to leave some devices hosted and ship the others on demand.After all, they are interested to get funding for their chips, there is no reasonable incentive to refuse giving us such a choice.This would impose two additional advantagesthe shipping costs do not need to be paid upfrontwe might reach an agreement to send those units to buyers who want to have them at home directly, instead of proxying them over SwitzerlandIf this group buy reaches the required threshold by tomorrow (which right now does not look like), I will clarify these open points before I start collecting the final funds.EDIT: forgot to address the other pointsAs forThis group buy assumes and makes only sense if the pre<rest of thread truncated>

Topic: alternative power supply for ANKER hubs?
### Original post:
I bought 6 of the anker branded usb hubs for running asicminer usb devices. They've worked okay, except so far a shocking 3! of them have had failed power supplies. The first I RMA'd the whole hub, got a new one working great, but for the second failure I noticed it was just the power supply so I told anker as much, and they just sent me an extra power supply. Well, now that extra ended up being DOA and another hub's power supply has failed in the meantime. I understand anker support is supposed to be good, and I'm sure they will try and send me more replacements, but the downtime and waiting is rather annoying. I'm thinking about just buying a 12v 5a power supply and seeing if it lasts a bit longer than the 4 amp supplies anker ships the hubs with.Any recommendations? Anyone else have problems with anker usb hub power supplies?

### Reply 1:
I don't have a power supply recommendation, but they probably failed because of improper cooling. I also own a few Anker 10 port hubs and the power supplies gets frighteningly hot. They just weren't made for 24/7 full power capacity (PSU rated for 4A -- 10 block erupters x .5A = 5A). Get a fan for the power supplies you have left before they fail. I use a coolermaster laptop pad and haven't yet had any failures.

### Reply 2:
Thanks for the suggestion, I too noticed the power supplies run hot.I found an old 12v 3a power supply that came with an lcd monitor and tried that, and it works fine. Just to play it safe I only have 7 devices in that hub, but it's been working overnight and all is good, and the power supply is actually running a bit cooler than the default supplies anker ships. I've also contacted anker so hopefully I can get some new working power supplies.I noticed the original 10 port hub have 12v 4a power supply, while the newer model has a 12v 5a supply, maybe that extra amp makes a difference.I'm tempted to just order a couple of power supplies from amazon such as this-<link> I'll wait and see how the next replacements from Anker do.

### Reply 3:
I have some 10 port Anker hubs I'd sell for .5 BTC shipped (in the US) if anyone wants them. International shipping will cost extra.I haven't had any issues with mine.

### Reply 4:
Has anyone torn down one of these hubs? I was hoping that as they use 12v PSUs, they might have a proper DC-DC converter inside, rather than a linear regulator which would just burn power to turn that 12v to 5v for USB...I'm thinking of running multiple USB hubs with 12v inputs from a 100/150W enclosed PSU like this: <link>

### Reply 5:
Why don't you just hook up the hubs to a standard reliable ATX power supply? A small one would be able to handle all your Anker hubs. All you would need is an adapter.

### Reply 6:
An ATX PSU would probably be cheaper, but a 12V only supply that is designed to be run 24/7 and is smaller and fanless, might actually be a better spend - for me at least.

### Reply 7:
I tore down my ORICO p10 hub, which seems to be an Anker clone, and it did indeed have DC-DC converter chips and inductors, so I expect it's fairly efficient My power meter is reading 32W at the wall for 10 USB hashers & the original laptop style PSU - so the loss is only about 7W.

### Reply 8:
Open-frame PSUs designed for running LED lighting or CCTV cameras are pretty cheap and very reliable. Something like this:<link> could also use a bench PSU - I have one here that does 30A at 12V and was less than 100, has current limiting function, and meters for voltage and amps on the front.

### Reply 10:
Hi Gingernuts and or anybody else who may know,My apologies if this is slightly off topic but I have myself just purchased (rightly or wrongly) an Orico P10 hub (P10-U2-BK) and was wondering would I be safe to use a 4.5/5A charger to power it? 3A is sufficient for 5 ASIC's but not for 8! Of course this item is brand new so I'm a little reluctant to tamper with it but equally if it's good for the job then it saves me RMA'ing the Orico and trying to find an alternative. If you could PM me with a reply and thus not needing to continue to deviate off topic! Failing that suggestions on a 10 port hub for use with my Raspberry Pi (which doesn't work USB 3.0 devices)EDIT : Rec'd the expected ""No"" from Orico regarding upping the PSU on the hub.. OK time to RMA it and get myself two D-Link 7 port hubs.. A little upset I couldnt find the holy grail!

Topic: How to solo mine using bitcoin core 0.13.1?
### Original post:
I have a ASIC miner ... I was wondering ..Can i just plug this in and use bitcoin core to mine by myself? I have watched some tutorials but those were all old version .One good answer will get a donation of 100000 satoshi. Leave your address

### Reply 1:
No.If I remember correctly, bitcoin core's mining capabilities have been removed or disabled due to the improfitability of normal cpu and gpu mining. Your best bet would be to somehow enable it (if possible) or install a different mining application.

### Reply 2:
The CPU miner was removed, the GPU (and ASIC) miner was never there.No. You will need a software which you must run your ASIC using. Some ASICs provide this interface on their firmware while some ASICs don't so you would have to use softwares like Cgminer.Bitcoin Core does not support stratum so you need a software that can support getwork. Else, you need a stratum proxy to convert the getwork to stratum.You need these in <truncated> local IP your miner is connecting <truncated> should consider going for ck's solo pool since that is far easier to use: <link> always, seansoutpost: <truncated>

### Reply 3:
The software can also support getblocktemplate too. Both getwork and getblocktemplate work fine for solo mining. Most modern mining software such as cgminer and bfgminer support both getwork and getblocktemplate.

Topic: KNC Miners - auto restart script
### Original post:
A few of us have noticed that .93 will restart cgminer a fair bit when performance dips and enjoyed the better overall avg hashingSince the other firmwares seem to not care and since there is no crontab installed....I wrote a simple shell script to auto-restart every X secondsPlace it in your /bin dir so not to care about paths, and keep a copy in your /config dir since reboots of the miner will overwrite a lot of files I named mine <truncated> truedo sh <truncated> restart sleep 9200done9200 seconds is about 2 1/2 hours. Change it to whatever you like.if this helps you, a few bits in the tipjar would be nice <truncated>

### Reply 2:
nice, I think the best way to mimic .93 would be to monitor your pool's reading of Gh and have it restart after the avg stays below a certain limit for 3 or 5 checks in a rowOr perhaps watch cgminer's Gh and HW errors & WU and make up a suitable floor for doing the sameI know Kano has a calculation that takes all this and gives an estimate of what 'paid hashing' your miner is really doingI am currently gaining about 40Gh more on avg just by restarting every 2 1/2 hours.. of course if a miner doesn't have issues recovering cores on its own this isn't needed

### Reply 3:
BUMP, this got lost in the mix there. I'll try to play with this a bit and let you know.

### Reply 4:
Just restarting CGminer every so often is not bringing it back to life, it quickly loses ghs after 30min and disturbs so many cores it doesn't help. I need an auto reboot mechanism. What I need is a similar script in the init startup to reboot every 2 hours. If anyone has suggestions

### Reply 5:
I ran your 1st script btc_uzr got thissh <truncated> line 9: syntax error: unexpected ""done"" (expecting ""then"")[1]+ Done(127) bash cgrestart.sh

I have a $5 tip for someone who gives me working script to reboot my jupiter every so many hours. Obviously it has to be run at startup and survive reboot. I have it on .91 with the reboot mod added. ThanksIt would be a bonus if it could detect ghs drop for x seconds then reboot as well.

### Reply 7:
you'd be better off running the reboot.cgi URL web command from a remote computer on a looped script for that.and since it would be driven from a remote machine, it would be possible to read the value off your pool's page and then do some type of stop limit type trigger for itI'm not much of a web coder but I've seen stuff like this in action. probably not hard for those into that

### Reply 8:
I assume you ran it on your desktop pc or similar, since the script executes fine on my KnCMiner; tested a min agoOn KnC devices there's no bash but sh./bin/sh -> /bin/busyboxand for example Ubuntu links it to dash/bin/sh -> dash

### Reply 9:
Good idea.btw:there's a nice tool/firefox plugin used for web-testing you can use with nearly zero knowledge about programming.for reloading the status page and clicking the restart-btn in case of crash, this will do the job for you I guessNot sure about checking a value on one page and trigger an action based on it on another webpage (check pool restart miner).<link>

### Original post:
Today i practically wasnt in the forum/thread. The reason was that i travelled through half of germany to bavaria and only now came back. I there visited the company that will import the chips, i checked everything there and made a contract to ensure everything. Before doing this i got the permission from avalon support to change the addresses for the batch-orders afterwards. The support will change this now fast too i hope.Now the import will go faster and without problems. Furthermore i made a deal with the company that, in case the vat is appropriate high, the company will make bills about the payable vat for the single groupbuyers. This case only applies in case the vat is appropriate high.In case the bills will be needed for vat i would collect billing addresses and an emailaddress to send the bill to from all parttakers in the groupbuy. At the moment 268 members. For now it wont be necessary because i have a ticket with avalon where i ask for more detailed infos about this. In case avalon isnt answering soon i will call Yifu again. In case this wont help i will collect addresses preventive. Its better to be prepared then having to wait later.So it looks like its slowly moving<rest of post truncated>

As we pay in bitcoins and bitcoins officially worth nothing, should we pay VAT?

### Reply 2:
If the price you paid is unknown or unreasonably low, the customs can calculate the ""market value"" and use that for VAT. And the chips are worth more than nothing, but who know how much...I think it depends on what value will Avalon declare. It should be less than what we paid, but not too low for customs to be suspicious (although the majority of standard SMT chips and components are less than $1).Also the customs sometimes tend to ""guess"" the price from the size of the package, so small box full of expensive chips declared as $10 won't be suspicious, but big big box with something really cheap would be

In Finland Vat is 24%. Dunno how it is in Germany. So i think that about <truncated> is too much. If there is any chance not to pay taxes, i think it must be used.

Germany does not give a damn how you pay <truncated> if you import, there will be a question ""How much is this worth"" and if you paid in rupees, they are going daily course.So, for this one, if they are progressive at customs, the best thing happening would be if they ask for a bill, to see the most ridiculous price drop in history, just to return the day after chip arrival Don't argue with german customs. If you want your money back and not pay taxes, you need to pay up first and then sue then. Making trouble with them can have a package laying at their facility for MONTHS or YEARS (Which you pay storage fees for) while the lawsuit is under way.What you use things for, is completely irrelevant to them. Sales price is what counts. Type of good is only important for import customs fee, which is ZERO for semi-conductor electronics in the EU. So only VAT applies.Here is my personal advice to german group buyers: Check with lawyer and Steuerberater first if you want to deduct the Einfuhrumsatzsteuer (Import VAT) at the end of the year.

Avalon for sure put some kind of Invoice with package, so that Invoice should be relevant.Other thing is insurance of package in case something unpredictable happen.Those are two variables should be taken into account to determine cost of customs.Any lying about value of the goods (in case to go that way) and we have to be ready to never see those chips.In case Avalon didn't send Invoice, we should ask them to provide it but I am sure that either of two mentioned is present (Invoice or insured value).No argue with customs should be my advice and all disputes should be settled once and only after we do like we are told.

Again, talking about custom here is not the best idea...

Its not a question if we can avoid it. The chance that it goes through custom without anything is slim, though i know of smartphones that go through without.

Only swiss has 9% vat but its not eu... when importing into swiss and then into eu we had the chance<rest of thread truncated>

Topic: [Antminer S9] How does the S9 know what hashrate to ""autotune"" to?
### Original post:
So this is a question that I've been wondering about for a while, but now I am even more motivated to find the answer due to the recent release of the ""Low Power Mode"" firmware from bitmain, which is autotune and doesn't seem to have a fixed frequency option.The question is, how does the S9 know what its hashrate is supposed to be? For example, I took one S9_13.5T and one S9_14.0T and flashed the <truncated> to both. Afterwards, the S9_13.5T still ""autotuned"" to 13.5 THs, same with the 14.0T.I was under the impression that flashing a new firmware overwrote the old filesystem. How then is it possible for the S9 to ""remember"" its assigned hashrate? Where is this value stored, and how can we change it?It would be great if we could ""autotune"" the S9 to 15 TH while it is on the ""Low Power Mode"" autotune firmware. I'm mainly only familiar with the fixed frequency firmwares / bmminers so I would really appreciate any insight into how the ""autotune"" firmwares work. Thanks!By its assigned hashrate, I am referring to the ""fixed rate"" displayed in the log:S9_13.5T after flash:Code:miner total rate=13772GH/s fixed <truncated> after flash:Code:miner total rate=14014GH/s fixed rate=14000GH/s

### Reply 1:
There is a chip on each hashboard that identifies what it is to the controller

### Reply 2:
Back flash to the May 17 firmware, use the <truncated> weblink to access the full speed menu and set it.Flash forward to 1023.

### Reply 3:
Thanks! I tested and confirmed this just to make sure.Do you know if there's any way to make a miner tune to a different hashrate? Or if there is a way to run the ""Low Power Mode"" firmware with a fixed frequency?

### Reply 4:
If you upgrade a fixed frequency miner with the new firmware package will it stay on fixed freq? I thought it was autofreq which would disregard the frequency setting from minerAdvanced.cgi. I'll have to try it tomorrow.

### Reply 5:
Cool! It turns out if you flash the low power file onto a miner with fixed frequency it will not override it to autofreq. Dunno why I didn't think to try that. Thanks everyone!

Not sure about the blade amount/case yet, you'd need quite a PSU for 5 I think? Could really use a protip for that.I would only assemble these cases WITHOUT the BLADES and the PSU and ship them to you.Pricetag is yet unknown as this thing is still in the designing phase.

Hello. I was wondering if the community had any interest in another design of an Avalon based mining board. I am aware of the current projects, but perhaps there are certain things that you may have wanted in the design that the other projects do not offer. I'm asking the community because I just started work on my own mining board, but I didn't plan to have any features that the other projects didn't currently offer. If I could design a board with unique features that you guys would want, then my design could be of use to people other than myself. Let me know what you think.

### Reply 2:

### Reply 3:
All I have done is make a library part for the Avalon chip in Kicad, so I haven't really done anything so far.I was thinking of designing a board that could be etched at home, but it would be a challenge getting it done on a double sided board and thermal vias wouldn't be doable. I have done plating of vias at home, but pretty much everyone else is not going to have that ability. I'm still trying to think of a decent way to get around the thermal vias. Of course, I plan on making a version that does use thermal vias that can be manufactured at a PCB fab if desired.But, the whole point of this thread was to gather any suggestions on particular features they would like to see in my board design that may have been overlooked by the other projects. I know that the other projects pretty much have everything covered already, so there may not be anything worth suggesting. If that is the case, then I will just work on my own design and release it when it is finished.Also, I am not intending on selling any boards. This is just another design that I plan to make public and anyone can manufacture it if they want.

ok not sure if this is relevant, ever since i switched to PPLNS from PPS i've been getting quite a bit more stale shares but here's the overall figuresis there something i should be concerned about?

you should be happy with 0.46% stale.

I would say that's really good. I thought that Avalons usually got 1to 5% stales.

### Reply 7:
I'm thinking 1% to 5% Hardware Errors which you would see in the mining software.But, .46% stale is still fine.Sam

### Reply 8:
Sorry for the thread necro. What is a reasonable percentage of duplicate shares for Avalon devices ?

### Reply 9:
Dupes should be close to zero. Earlier avalon firmware had design problems that caused dupes and updating firmware should fix it.

### Reply 10:
You should be happy, I have a 2% stale share, tried many method and still won't reduce.

### Reply 11:
0.46% stale is quite usual for an Avalon these days. One thing to keep in mind is that stale rates will scale roughly in proportion with network growth rate. So when you're at a period of 20-30% network growth rate, you can expect roughly that many more stales than normal. So if 0.40% was your nominal rate, it may be 0.48-0.52% when network is growing rapidly.Dupes are often firmware related, but can also be network connectivity (resubmission of a share due to lack of response in a timely manner). I know FPGAs were big culprits of duplicates, but they weren't actually *wasted* work, it was simply that there was some kind of firmware bug that caused them to report the same nonce information in certain scenarios where no solution was found when the nonce range was depleted.My Avalon lately has been mostly clean on dupes with later firmware, generally a completely insignificant amount. It may be network connectivity, since my Avalon is on wireless across the house, with a microwave in the middle

E.g. for a triple 5830 system:Days to next reset:5.0, based on <link> of next reset: 513600, based on <link> per difficulty increase after the next one: 8Difficulty increase factor after the next one: 1.3 (30% average increase)Watts: 550$/KWh: 0.12MHash/Sec: 840 (3 * 280 per 5830)$/Bitcoin: 10Running the above numbers, on August 18 the electric cost exceeds the generated bitcoin value. Total income at that point (assuming selling bitcoins at $10 apiece) is $492 - putting together a 3-way 5830 system for $492 is pretty tough (used parts maybe?)Are other people using more optimistic numbers?

### Reply 1:
Nope, you're right on.The only thing people are using to justify investing large amounts of money into this...Is Bitcoin price speculation.

### Reply 2:
Your calculation only takes in account the current spot price, just as calculations a month ago were made assuming $4 or lower spot price, and 3 months ago a fraction of that.I don't deny the profitability is volatile at best if you are starting out just now. I just don't see a likely scenario where the price will suddenly start plummeting or simply stagnating at $9-$10 when mining becomes harder & more users become aware of bitcoin every day.I started nearly a year ago but I can perfectly see the rationale behind adding more rigs today. It still pays itself back relatively fast, and could even accelerate at an unknown pace.

There is almost not believable way that doesn't sound arrogant or deluded to put the price into perspective once this happens. It might be akin to a land grab in the old west, but with the land values rising to their fair value in a matter of years. Between now and then one of the following will happen to the price.1.It will collapse for a while. This drives people out and pushes difficulty down, it has happened before and might very well again. Typical causes might be a negative court ruling in the US or some other jurisdiction. In the long run BTC will probably survive this since not every place on earth is likely to make it illegal and due to its nature, if not every place on earth has it illegal, it will have value everywhere.So you mine easy for a while and hold the BTC and maybe conduct some of your own business in BTC. Waiting for the value increase to resume.2. It will stabilize. If this happens only the rigs with high Mhash/Watt are worth investing in. This would have to persist for very long to be a concern. FPGA rigs might become very<rest of post truncated>

Here are some scenarios where this can happen:The Dwolla/MtGox BTC <--> $$$ link breaks, perhaps due to pressure from bank regulators in response to Paypal or VC/MC lobbyists.The speculators who are buying BTC run out of money/the bubble bursts, as Genrobo mentionedSomeone hacks MtGox or some other key BitCoin participant to steal BTC balancesSomeone identifies a cryptographic fault with the Bitcoin schemeAll of these scenarios would cause a crash in BTC values. I guess you can argue they are unlikely - at least the first two seen quite plausible to me.

### Reply 6:
I'm not saying it will rise indefinitely into the hundreds of thousands or millions. In reality, I don't even care what makes up the price as long as it stays at that, drops lower or rises. I'm saying it still pays off to mine, even a year later. At 8ghps I'm still making way, way more than the cost of electricity and AC.And that's going to be the same for anyone starting today. At worst, they lose out on the electricity costs and 10-20% resale value of the hardware if everything drops to zero tomorrow. At best, they pay off their initial investment in a month or less and gain profit after that.Note that I didn't go into the specifics of what makes up BTC value. I'm merely answering OP's question about why some people still invest into new rigs. Of course Paypal/LR/ MTGOX raids etc. are possible. They just seem like a distant possibility at the moment.

### Reply 7:
True, but if this happens quadruple your mining equipment as fast as you can. Some other jurisdiction will pick it up.

### Reply 8:
Well, I'd actually argue that this one is the most likely, especially given a large enough botnet and financial interest (more profit in using the botnet to forge transactions than participating in block discovery). Even Satoshi agrees that BTC is ""practically"" impossible to forge, but it's technically feasible by a large enough attacker.

Back end

### Reply 2:
The whole unit weights exactly 5.0 kg, very easy to carry around

### Reply 3:
The camera was used to capture pretty girls, now girls are gone and only miners left

### Reply 4:
The connectors, one serial for testing purpose I guess, USB, SD, LAN, all described in SP 20 quick start manual (It seems I could not find the user manual from Spondoolies website)

### Reply 5:
Just received my SP20 a couple of days after the review campaign, delivered from Israel directly to Sweden without any custom charge!Packaging is compact and sturdy, very well protected

### Reply 6:
Naturally, I thought the PSU is not enough strong, so I took another 1300W PSU and tested, same faultThen I saw on ""Settings"" page, I could select ""Basic Voltage settings"" and then pick the ""slow fans, medium rate"" option, restarted miner. Immediately it hashes at 1.4 GH! So I think there is a bug in that advanced setting page, it does not recognize the PSU even I put 120 in all of the fields, and by using basic voltage settings, all those fields turned to 1100Then I reduced all the voltage to 0.6 and the unit run at 940GH/S, ASIC stats looks like this

### Reply 7:
I have only two spare 500W PSU left from old time BFL singles bundle (They were so generous at that time that they even delivered a PSU with their unit, I never used them )I hook them up, started miner and went to the Settings page, lowered all the voltage to minimum (0.58) and filled in 200 in all 4 field: ""Max PSU Power Unit 1 (70W - 288W) "", and restarted miner. It turns out the miner only runs at 370GH and by looking at ASIC stats page, two of the ASIC loops are not working:

### Reply 8:
And the amazing thing with SP20: each of the two PSU draws only 220W on wall! With only 440W I can get 940GH, e.g. 0.47J/GH on Wall. A 20nm very efficient Knc Neptune running 3.3TH at 1900W on wall, that is barely 0.58J/GH. And SP20 at 1.4GH draws around 800W, on par with Neptune, it is definitely a nice choice given the current market price of $659 per unit, very well engineered product!

### Reply 9:
That is the lowest I have seen. Wow that is a impressive under clock.

### Reply 10:
those are the lowest numbers yet. damn they are good.please show a screen shot of the settings page.

### Reply 11:
Now after a restart it turns to 900GH, and ASIC stats shows lower frequency at 595Hz. Maybe due to rise in room temperature, anyway, settings are all set to 0.6

### Reply 12:
I'm personally thinking of buying a better fan and swapping it in, wonder if that'll make a huge difference?

### Reply 13:
And the only problem for home mining is its noise, just like a vacuum cleaner running, it is impossible to run at home. With even one door closed I can hear it clearly far away. So either you run it in a specialized garage/mining farm, or you have to take some modification for the cooling system. I will take it apart tomorrow to see what I can do with itI suppose that the original fan deliver a huge amount of airflow like 200 CFM maximum, but when heavily under clocked, maybe a general low CFM/noise fan can deal with the heat

### Reply 14:
Currently I can put it close to window, where 5c cold air are sucked into the room, maybe even a GT1850 (which is almost silent) can deal with the heat. But who knows when summer comesJust checked the fan, it is more than 2A, definitely over 200 CFM, this is standard for server application, but not suitable at home

### Reply 15:
Thank you for the review.

### Reply 16:
Just upgraded the firmware to the latest version 2.5.33, now I can drop the fan speed to 20 percent, still plenty of airflow (more than 100 CFM) but noise has come down quite a bit. I think if it is a pwm fan, even 10% could work, since now the back end temp is mere 46c degree, and I have seen some miners have a backend temp as high as 70c degree

### Reply 17:
Thank you too for letting us review such a great product!Before I started to operate SP20, I thought this kind of products are just like many other miners on the market: You stack them up in a mining farm and pay lots of electricity and cooling cost, and sell the coins to cover these cost, and bring down the bitcoin exchange rate during the process. I even planned to give it to friends who are interested in bitcoin after this reviewBut after seeing the stunning efficiency of this miner, I'm very impressed. I had a feeling that the old good mining time is back: With this unit running at 500W, the electricity cost is neglectable, so anyone can just hold on to all the mined coins without selling a bitNow I'm very interested to run it for an extensive period of time with a modified cooling solution

Just heats up quicker.

I came across a website called bitcrane . Has anyone dealt with them ? Im really debating on whether or not to get one . They dont seem to know what power efficiency is .

### Reply 1:
You should check for a Bitmain S5, a SP20 or a Avalon 4.1

### Reply 2:
One man called dogie has. <link> really, why do you want to get Bitcrane?.. Some day soon there will be (should be) released new miner by Bitmain, wait for it... It definetely will be twice more efficient...

### Reply 3:
Go with Bitmain Antminer S5 or Spondoolies Tech Yukon SP31.Avoid Bitcrane as they are unlikely to have more products out and they use hard to get chips from a scammy company and Avalon has caused millions of dollars in losses to the community so avoid them just because it is the right thing to do.

Is not a good buy but the company is legit and they did in my opinion the best miner based on the HashFast chips, a nice unit for a museum.RegardsJuan

They are outstanding looking miners and appear to be very well designed. But they were terribly late to market and their time has passed. Efficiency, foot print, speed, cost have all improved significantly. They were old when they were first rolled out.There 7 Th/s miner is a monster. I don't think they consulted any large scale miners when they designed that.

### Reply 12:
You support Technobit. Not their customers.You should be warning people OFF them not promoting them and hoping for Marto to pump out more crap and late products.Be honest Technobit is a mess and people should avoid them.Let us be clear. Avalon or whatever you call them now are the same people that caused millions in losses to this community. No matter how DOGIE wants to play it you would be advised to avoid anything from that company in solidarity for those that lost a lot of money on their bullshit and they never ever compensated anyone for that nor did they apologize.There is little left in consumer based mining and thankfully that means people who continue to prop up companies that have scammed and are scamming will have little to support as things move forward. End of era but clearly you need to avoid Avalon 4.1 and Technobit as well as Bitcrane.

### Reply 13:
I will let you handle the warning jobs. I am a customer support after all.

### Reply 14:
Support isn't support when you're ignoring fraud. Dogie knows all about that.Enjoy helping people you could have saved the hassle of buying from TECHNOBIT with a simple warning. Did you invest in his latest scam or is supporting it by expressing how you are anticipating a 25,000 scam on BTCjam also part of your altruistic support?

Unless you like charity, having too much of them .. or circus, watching the replies here.

The people here is not kid anymore. Judge the manufacturer / seller by yourself. Read the forum before buying. Ask in forum. Run ROI calculation.Bitcoin is adult thing, not for kid. Agree

10/10 on ethics right Dogie...10/10 on time shipping right Dogie...Ethically I think both Zich and Dogie are compromised.Neither side with the consumers on issues like this and that is telling. Oh so it is buyer beware and you can continue to promote a company completely caught red handed lying to people. Well Technobit is clearly predatory and has been for years. Simply no excuses at this point to support anything they are doing given the level of fraud. Suffice to say that no one really should recommend Bitcrane or Avalon 4.1 simply on price / efficiency points as other have.Choose reputable suppliers and producers.1. Spondoolies or Bitmain2.

Topic: Win XP mining help needed
### Original post:
I just brought rig but I can not start mining. The problem I am facing is the win XP can identify the card, but the GUI or CG miner can not. And the rig can not be booted into BAMT or Ubuntu with stick as well. At first GUI miner said can not find openCL GPU, later, after I updated all the drivers to be latest, such as 2.5 OpenCL, the GUI miner can be booted, but I have only one usable miner, which is the CPU. Help needed ASAP!!! Thank you guys.

### Reply 1:
<truncated> telling us that it cannot detect ""the card"" ""but windows does"" and then later you state that ""i only have one usable miner, wich is the <truncated> graphics card do you have?If you do not have a GPU, Do not bother trying to mine bitcoins, Your just going to burnup your cpu.

### Reply 2:
I have a 5750, two 5870 and a 6870, to get started, I only tried one of them at the same time. By ""windows does"" I mean that I can find them in device manager and CCC, by ""I only have one usable miner"", I mean the GUI considering I only have one usable miner.

### Reply 3:
o.0 Do you have Cat12.4? Those drivers fucked with me personally, But i heavily doubt that 12.4 would do such a thing...Friggin cgminer doesnt show it? Do you have TeamViewer? perhaps i could take a look for you

### Reply 4:
I do have CCC12.4 and I tried different drivers a lot as well, to make them work. I am out of house, maybe we can set up a time to work this out. They are frustrating, I hate the feeling that 1.2 G computing power is wasting in front of me.

### Reply 5:
So even plugging one card in at a time... The Mining softwares do not detect a card? and windows does? Sorry but thats outta my skill range.

### Reply 6:
That's fine. I know it is weird. All the mining software are telling me that no usable GPU. But the graphic is definitely working as I can see the things on the screen, and it is identified by CCC and device manager.

### Reply 7:
I can only think of somekind of error with your openCL drivers....fwiw... win7 is PISS easy to install..

### Reply 8:
The latest is not always the greatest.I suggest using 11.12 or 12.1 driver for using 5xxx or 6xxx cards, and using 2.1 SDK for 5xxx cards and 2.4 or 2.5 for using 6xxx cards. Guiminer, and some other miners/frontends, will not detect 2.1 unless 2.4/2.5/2.6 (2.6 is not recommended, much slower) is also present. Verify your cards, SDK, and driver with GPU Caps viewer.

### Reply 9:
On Windoze XP I liked using Catalyst 11.6. Had to use dummy plugs on the GPU's that didn't have monitors though.Sam

make sure your copy of XP is fully up to date (SP3 etc). the latest AMD drivers need some .NET stuff to I believe.

It's blatantly a scam! I don't know why anyone suggests an ounce of doubt! Supposedly operating out of China.Rip off of popular mining devices from BFL.Exact same scam as Asicrigs.com, after they supposedly pulled their scam, which they haven't.

Yah think? When will people just call it straight out: someone who cannot possibly have the technology, violates legitimate vendors' IP and copyright protections on their website, and has fraudulent contract information is not ""too high of a risk!""They're fucking scammers!

Maybe they'll even get some product in the future to sell (updates are:- some units are sold... stock has begun moving- there's a power consumption specified)So you're reading this you scammer... You've forgot to specify, that power source is included (or maybe target audience's expecting integrated power source, no worry it wouldn't fit in that tiny butterfly lab's box Should have specified some made up numbers instead...

Topic: T17 whole machine can be sink in dielectric fluid tank?
### Original post:
Hello guys, I am newbie about mining and i need to know many things about mining with miner. I run T17 in my house and it's run so noise. I try to low noise but not work. So, i google about to silent miner and found that cooling and silent can be fix by sink the miner to the dielectric fluid tank. In video, they showed with s9 and PSU is out of the tank but T17 is attached PSU. So i curious ""T17 whole machine can be sink in dielectric fluid tank?"" and is there any problem?please suggest do and don't things.

### Reply 1:
I never heard someone succeed running a t17 in mineral oil it won't work on t17 with original firmware it will detect some error like no fan or slow but if you could flash it with custom firmware like braiins OS it might work. Check their official thread here <link> try to ask if someone succeeds in running t17 with mineral oil.

### Reply 2:
Thanks for your information.

### Reply 3:
I don't see why you can't, you will have two problems you need to fix.1- The miner's fans, since you have to remove those for immersion cooling the control board won't allow the hash boards to hash, and thus, you have two solutions, running custom firmware like Vnish which has an option to disable the fan check, the other solution would be a fan simulator, it's something you can find online that ""tricks"" the control board by giving it a false signal similar to the one it would get from the actual fans.2-The PSU's fans:This will be a bit more tricky to solve, the PSU needs the fan to be spinning in order to function, so not sure how you would bypass that, however, I believe the control board controls the PSU, so my guess is that these custom firmware will also handle the PSU fans when you activate immersion cooling option, to confirm this, head to their official topis and ask there, check AwesomeMiner, Asic.to and BO+.

### Reply 4:
Thanks mikeywith, I can't try with custom firmware because i update antminer firmware and then my SD card is not work.May be i need to buy another control board to install custom firmware. Or i try another way to low noise.

### Reply 5:
As far as i know there is no problem with the PSU missing fans, it may stop providing power if overheated. And yes there are many people doing immersion with Braiins OS+ with all the S17 family.

### Reply 6:
It's unlikely that you are going to need a new control board, flashing these gears with an SDcard is a bit tricky, some sdcards just don't work, you need to try a few of them before giving up, try the one with the small size, also, make sure you are following the instructions step by step.

### Reply 7:
The manufacturer did not use an SDXC capable chip, so you are restricted to 16G or less from their documentation (32G SDHC may work).There is the chance that the micro sd card needs to be inserted upside down.Or, the contacts are dirty, or you need to keep pushing the sd card physically during the whole process.And, some control boards might be missing the micro sd control chip for unknown reasons.Sadly, there is some malware out there that triggers the efuses with the malicious intention of blocking you from removing out their malware hash stealing fw. Some spread in Russia, China, etc. This is why you must never leave default or simple passwords in the miners, or have windows PCs in the same LAN.

Good. Disconnect from your computer. Plug ethernet directly from ant to your router or switch. Reboot the ant. wait 2 minutes. See if the green lights start hashing on the sides of the Ant.If that doesn't work, you can reset the ant with the reset button, then try connecting via wifi.

Topic: Mining with invisible/hidden console on windows?
### Original post:
I'm trying to find a way to run a miner without a gui on windows without it being visible (other than in the task manager). Anybody got any ideas on how to do this?So far, I've tried hstart (<link> which lets me run batch files without the command prompt, and also I've tried a vbs script. With both methods, the poclbm.exe process seems to start fine, and I see it in my task manager, however, when checking my worker stats in my pools, I see that they're not working at all. However, when removing the /noconsole flag from hstart but otherwise running it the exact same way, I get poclbm.exe with the console and it shows my worker as active in my pool.So do you guys have any experience in getting this to work? Know what I might be doing wrong?

### Reply 1:
Use zhider, works great!

### Reply 2:
afaik poclbm and poclbm-gui are both open source.I guess you could manipulate it so that the poclbm-gui will not use a tray symbol or something like that.If you found a way pls let us know.

### Reply 3:
I've asked the same question a few days ago. No real answer, after searching the forum I arrived pretty much at the same few things you've tried to no avail. I've been busy building my 1st mining rig though.However, I also tried window's task scheduler with and without condition on both XP and Win7 however I also faced the same problem. When it's ran like this, poclbm runs find but doesn't mine. I also tried it with guiminer which have 'auto-start' but still it doesn't mine.I hope someone would be able to shed some light on this.

### Reply 4:
I like <truncated> which you can get from <link> where I originally found the link here: <link> It's only 2KB and I use it for a scheduled task that rysncs a file on a remote server. Security software may complain about it, seeing it can be used for malicious purposes.If you still want output, you could make a shortcut like:Target: <truncated> cmd /C ""miner.exe --arguments values > output.txt""Start in: <truncated> have to kill them from Task Manager, which isn't a big deal with miners.

### Reply 5:
Funny, I was just about to start a new thread on this topic then this one popped up to the top of the list!I've tried a couple of options too without any success.I've noticed that when you attempt to run poclbm OR phoenix without access to the GUI, it cannot find the platform ID. Here's the error:Traceback (most recent call last): File ""poclbm.py"", line 27, in <truncated> clGetPlatformIDs failed: invalid/unknown error codeI know nothing about coding so wouldn't know where to start trying to get around that.Anyway I am also still searching for a solution so here's hoping we can work it out

### Reply 6:
And I think we all know exactly why you want it being ran hidden....tsk, tsk.

### Reply 7:
Well with a VBScript, it's quite simple :Set WshShell = <truncated> ""cmd /c cd <truncated> & phoenix.exe -u <link> VECTORS BFI_INT AGGRESSION=7 DEVICE=0"", 0The important part here is passing 0 as the second parameter of WshShell.RunIt tells cmd.exe to hide its window.You will have to kill phoenix.exe (or whatever miner you're using) from the task manager.Of course, replace <truncated> with the folder of your miner's exe,and ""phoenix.exe ..."" with the command you normally use to run your miner.Also, why do you want to hide it?

### Reply 8:
The trick with all this is that you still need a way to unhide it mid-process to check that it is in fact connected and working. I can picture one of these running all day at 0 Mhashes/s and people not knowing the difference because it's hidden.

### Reply 9:
If you have a legitimate use case for this, I would consider an option in my GUI to have no tray icon when minimized. But it seems more likely that you're just trying to be unethical with this. Prove me wrong and we'll talk

### Reply 10:
Use this program:<link> it to come on 10 seconds after the screensaver. It terminates the program when any activity is detected. If you want to verify that it is running, have Afterburner running in the background and check its graphs. Or set your stealth miner as a pool worker and check on it via the web. I am the IT guy at my work, and I have this running on a few machines successfully. The users never notice since it only runs when they aren't using their machines.

### Reply 11:
Well, my reason for wanting this is pretty simple. I'm leaving for military service for 11 months and I'm letting my little sister use my pc while I'm gone, I just want to keep mining and I don't want her to be able to mess with the miner.

I've been mining for a few days now and when I first started out, I couldn't submit any shares because it always returns a ""Verification failed, check hardware!"" warning.I did some googling and it seems to be a common problem. I tried everything to no avail until I tried mining with Phoenix 1.7.5. Smooth as silk.I'm not sure what's the difference between Phoenix and the other miners. Some enlightenment, anyone?

I am seeing the exact issue. Unfortunately, I do not have a solution for you. My setup is (3) 5970s with windows 8 Professions 64 bit. I can tell you that I had a working system before steam updated my ATI driver to 13.4. Since then I have not been able to get back to a good working state. I even reinstalled my entire OS.

### Reply 2:
Same here. I can mine LTC OK using Reaper, but BTC and LTC with cgminer is stuffed. 13.4 drivers on a fresh install of Windows 7.

### Reply 3:
I am assuming that you are using 64 bit windows 7? I have had the same issue with both 13.1 and 13.4. From what I have read it is really the AMD APP SDK version that matters not the driver, but I have not been able to get a working version back up. Before I reinstalled my OS I had a working setup with 13.1 drivers.

### Reply 4:
Phoenix is a good miner. Do you need a different one?CGMiner's FAQ has driver and SDK suggestions. It is very difficult to back level the SDK if you installed 2.6 or later. So if you don't need SDK 2.6 for the 7xxx series cards be careful to never install it.Sam

### Reply 5:
Phoenix is okay, but I was seeing much better numbers with cgminer (1800 MHash versus 2100 MHash). I did install SDK 2.8. I guess it might just be best to try and reinstall my system again.

### Reply 6:
Probably. Make sure you don't go past OpenCL SDK 2.5 for 5xxx series cards.

Topic: Maybe everyone here will learn a lesson about pre-orders
### Original post:
I nearly fell victim to this bullshit myself. Fortunately, I got my credit card refund out of bASIC over a month ago. I saw the writing on the wall and knew this shit was going to get ugly. I was supposed to actually help Tom put the units together. We had phone calls and numerous communications. Then the communication got slower and the delays started. Something didn't smell right.Maybe every other vendor will ship, but it wouldn't surprise me if some don't.Funding a business venture with pre-order money is bad business. It's especially bad business if you are the one putting up your money.THERE IS NO REASON FOR ANY SANE PERSON TO BE A CAPITAL INVESTOR AND NOT RECEIVE AN EQUITY STAKE OR INTEREST PAID ON YOUR CAPITAL!If you give a business your money in advance and there is no specific, contracted date for you to receive your product, then YOU are a capital investor. Especially if there isn't even a working documented prototype.Simply getting a ""place in line"" is not good enough. You should be compensated for assuming so much risk. Yet the foolish people on this forum justified this bullshit for months.How long has BFL held money now? 6 months? Go ahead justify away, but the amount<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
I'm kind of embarrassed that I waited as long as I did to request a refund. I feel like I just *barely* made it out unscathed (aside from missing out on ~20% gain in BTC value).In retrospect, the hosting plan announcement should have been enough evidence for me to decide to get out. It said 3 words about the product, and the rest was diversion.There were many small signs before that too.

### Reply 2:
The bottom line is people should never give anyone money in advance to simply purchase a product.A deposit? Sure, especially on a product which is custom made. Although ASIC's are only custom when originally designed.If these companies had enough capital to fund the development of their products through their first production run, then there was NO good reason for them to accept pre-orders.They could only be doing this for nefarious reasons, either to squelch competition or because they were lying about their capital position.Again, I could understand if they needed to match their initial production run with expected demand, then they would take a deposit to be sure their customers were serious.The only ASIC project which had the right to take pre-order capital was block eruptor run by friedcat. That project was clear about risk and will be paying a return to their investors for that risk.

### Reply 3:
This is a unique time in Bitcoin's history. I don't imagine this will be repeated again. I think you lack perspective in not realizing that these products would have not been created without the pre-orders. It simply was not possible. In the future you would be a fool to preorder. Most understand that this process was a gamble. Some will win and some will lose.

### Reply 4:
That's BS. These projects didn't NEED to happen in the first place. The 51% thing has been debunked as a viable threat because the attacker shoots themselves in the foot.Someone would have come along and developed an ASIC on their own regardless.I still stand by my original post. If these companies needed pre-order money to FUND an ASIC, then they should have offered terms which reflected the true risk of the project by paying equity or interest on the customers capital <truncated> are for established products were the demand outstrips supply.Pre-orders are NOT an ethical way to raise capital for a start-up project.

Hate to say it, but it seems my gut feeling 6 weeks ago was correct.I've yet to see any real level of professionalism from any of these ASIC manufacturer's thats been deserved of any pre-order investment captial. None of them have convinced me yet they are capable of running businesses handling 6 figure turnovers.

### Reply 6:
I disagree.ASIC preorders are high risk but they are also high reward.Take for example Avalon's first batch, which is expected to ship 300 66Gh/s units. This will double the network hashrate. A single $1300 unit will return $2200 in a month ($1460 if ASICMINER brings another 20 TH/s online). This is a ridiculous return on investment that is more in line with investing in a startup than purchasing a consumer product.I placed early preorders with all three vendors. I did this with the assumption that my payment would be used to fund development. I also assumed that I risked losing my money to scams or simply a failure to deliver due to technical issues. When I ordered the upgrade to my FPGA minirig, I factored in a 10-20% chance that BFL was pulling a long con into my calculations. The potential benefits of receiving the first batch of 1TH/s miners out-weighed this risk. If there was no risk, why wouldn't the ASIC companies just mine themselves until it was only marginally profitable<rest of thread truncated>

Topic: Antminer S9 Hard Reboot
### Original post:
Hello and thanks ahead of time. Is there a way to hard reboot (power cycle or equivalent) an antminer s9 remotely? The reboot in the gui doesnt seem to fix alot of issues that a hard reboot (unplug/replug) solves. I can use putty to access the miner. Just wondering if there are linux commands to shutdown and restart that is equivalent to a hard reboot.

### Reply 1:
The only way to perform a hard reboot is to remove the power and re apply it, unless you have a smart PDU or someone to unplug it / disconnect the power I don't think you'll be able to do what you want.

### Reply 2:
GUI reboot is soft reboot. Also the API reboot call is a soft reboot.If you use putty you can access the shell and then run /sbin/reboot which seems equivalent to a hard reboot.

### Reply 3:
I have found you really need to power cycle the unit to reinitialize cards that are having issues. You can buy a device that allows you to SSH in and physically switch power on and offYou want something like this:<link> you need to make sure it supports your PSU (110v versus 220v) and the proper amperage.The link I posted was for informational use only, it is not a specific recommendation.

### Reply 4:
You can try this method from here On-board auto reboot with Antminer S9 (daily reboots) At least you can do the hard reboot automatically and schedule what time you want to reboot it. For now, I don't find any methods that you can fully reboot remotely your miner, the above link maybe solved your issue.

### Reply 5:
I just tried /sbin/reboot and it restarted a board that would not restart using the gui reboot. Thanks guys

### Reply 6:
Glad I could help! I haven't yet found any difference between /sbin/reboot and physically power cycling the miner.

I ordered an 80 gh/s (80 GH/s Coin Miner $1,545) hoping to pay via credit card as their site clearly stated that they accept CC on the 2 smaller units. After a week, got an e-mail saying that they can't accept CC and wanted me to paid via Bitcoins or wire transfer. I ignored it and today, I got this.Hi XXX and Merry Christmas!I just wanted to follow up on the order that you placed with us.

If you paid attention, someone else said they went to their location. It does exist. Their previous office, maybe not, because nobody in the surrounding area even heard of AMT... but the new one does exist.

### Reply 7:
I guess this confirms the use of ""Coincraft A1"" chips...Now all they need to do is sell the assembled miner boards, and they will have a massive market ready to buy them in bulk!From what I understand the ""Close-out"", is how they are saying, ""End of this batch"". The next batch should have new delivery dates, and may or may-not have a new price... It already went up from $5,599.00 to $5,999.00... Might go up again, or back down, or get an upgrade to design for a new model. We won't know until after Friday.I think we lost our chance of getting real direct answers due to the senseless troll-posts and accusations of being fake, to being part of a secret organization, to being in a whole other country, to having impossible specs on hardware. Not as funny to them, as it is to us. But equally as frustrating to deal with.

### Reply 8:
You know, Michael Dell used to assembly his PCs from his dorm room.These folks are essentially assembly systems source from Bitfury and Bitmine (both in Europe), into stand alone units.I don't expect them to really have top notch technical talent.I do however expect them to deliver the goods when their sources start shipping.

### Reply 9:
As I understand it, they have paid a company to MFG the boards. They, unlike BFL, are not assembling the boards themselves. The photo's on flicker show the boards already assembled in Bulgaria, at a factory. The assembly they are doing in-house, is configuring the network-boards to work with X-number of miner-boards, and connecting the physical components. (Same thing alien-ware does for Dell now. Alien-ware does not manufacture anything, they are just assemblers of existing components.)I am sure the boards are being designed by someone with the tools and the knowledge to do so. Might even be coincraft themselves doing the MFG of the boards, to match the chips. (To the specs of the clients.)In any event, the only thing that matters is the delivery and the final operating results of delivered materials. Doesn't matter who made them, or how they were made, if they function and are guaranteed. Though, I am sure that anyone has the ability to do this in a basement. Location is irrelevant. It is not like they are producing millions of units themselves. I would actually find that to be ""unbelievable"", if they claimed such an impossible feat. However, assembly is easily possible, by the t<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 10:
Exactly. That is why their story is completely believable. We know where they are sourcing their 28nm parts, it is bitmine.ch. Bitmine.ch is from Switzerland and has stated in their website that AMT was their exclusive U.S. distributor. Furthermore, does not make sense for Bitmine.ch to send completed units with heavy cases and power supplies. So all that is sent are the logic boards and AMT assembles them.The actual assembly may be different from coincraft after all these cases may be source from china.The current 55nm line appears to be bitfury (from bulgaria), so these are what they are selling for quicker delivery.As far as trolls are concerned, they have motivation to discourage everyone from buying hardware.

### Original post:
Hey Everyone, I know this topic has come up in the past, So I appologize. For the record... I have read most posts and it seems it doesn't help or it's outdated.I'm currently running a Rig with two 5970's and one 5770. The 5970's are crossfired and the 5770 is just with a dummy DVI plug. I'm using GUIminer and MSI Afterburner. I'm trying to underclock the memory to 300mhz. I've read this can reduce the heat by a substantial amount. I could really use a couple degree's drop. I've tried altering the .CFG file with no success. It usually results in a freeze and then forced reboot. I'm running Windows 7 XP and i've only been able to alter the .CFG file when in SafeMode.Is there another way or program that could underclock the memory?Thanks

Use linux and cgminer w/ Catalyst 13.1, AMD APP SDK 2.7, AMD ADL 5.0 installed. That allowed me to adjust my voltages on my 5770s.

Topic: IMETs response to AMT (Advanced Mining Technology Inc) negative allegations
### Original post:
IMET is a reputable contract manufacturing and product development company that has been in business for 14 years. Our reputation is utmost important, so we wanted to address the negative allegations presented by AMT and Josh Zipkin. IMET was contracted to build Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) for AMT miners in February of 2014. The Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) were built to print from various design revisions that were supplied by AMT through Bitmine. IMET did supply the parts and any part <truncated> changes were approved in advance by Bitmine and/or AMT. IMET does not buy parts from the gray market. Per our ISO-9000 requirements, we only purchase parts from approved vendors. After thorough inspection including AOI (Automatic Optical Inspection), the PCBs were delivered to AMT. Prior to delivery, IMET did verify that the individual PCBs would hash at approximately 200gh/s. The only discrepancy seen was when there were bad cores in an A1 chip. In this case, the hash rate was lower depending on the number of working cores. AMT was responsible for the mechanical designs, thermal designs (heatsinks), assembly, final test and QC. The IMET engineering team can confirm that the boards (h<rest of post truncated>

I was well aware of Joshua Zipkin writing checks he couldn't honor back in March. Sadly, you ain't the only guys. I'm going to try my best to retrieve the posts proving such, but bear in mind that Josh had me delete a many posts on the old thread prior to firing up his self-moderated thread where ALL my posts were deleted. Now, he has reverted to threatening to kill me.Josh Zipkin is a highly unstable individual, and you can take that to the bank... Oops! Apologies.

you guys were shady since the beginning... not being open and clear, hiding address pretending as if this was due to security and etc, escaping customers' questions, refunds, trying to reopen new threads just because your shady business was getting exposed... anyway i'm glad my intuition proved me right on fraudsters like you...

### Reply 6:
Poserko (AKA Zipkin)Did your customers have paid to IMET?You are the one who took their money. So it is your problem if IMET are going to refund you or notYou are the one who own money to folks here NOT IMET!!!!So do not make any connection to IMET and YOUR DEBTS!

### Reply 7:
Is this the real imet or some shady scam account.One can never be sure in these. They sound reasonable and the other guy does not. Dont know the whole process. In the business one can not just point ones debt to other so even if there was some mishap happening, even then imet wouldnt be responsible for other than amt. methinks this way?

### Reply 8:
Yes of course I agree. You know that me and some other folks here are responsible for amt failure right Zipkin is just responsible to collect money and to deliver crap or nothing with constant bulshit and lies

### Reply 9:
Were there any legal proceedings in regards to this?

### Reply 10:
yes. ongoing.

### Reply 11:
IMET, did you manufacture this board? The one with the burn marks?

### Reply 12:
Or the lack of copper in the board itself cause the trails to overheat. IMET chose to cut costs, we paid the price.

### Reply 13:
If that was a short and not an overheat, wouldn't a very short piece of track be totally be destroyed, rather than the longer section we see here?

Followed by taserz 24 minutes write up.But I just want to buy one and get it like now

### Reply 5:
Pretty sure he means one is out of the factory / testing area and is actually in someone's hands.Measured power draw is in the OP about 2kW but it should be noted that this is due to the heat, the miner itself is right around 31TH on the pool and goes between 30-32. The miner is doing everything to stay at the target hashrate even in the extreme temperatures / power draw increase is being caused by the loss of efficiency due to the heat. *Based on the temps and power draw it is right around par with what occurred in testing except I think in their video they only went up to ~40C.

### Reply 6:
Ja though of course Kano has been seeing them on his pool for over a month as that's where Canaan does the burn-in testing. Assuming that 109-118F is chip temp gotta say I'm impressed. What's the measured power draw?Can't wait for the one I ordered a couple weeks ago to ship in July

### Reply 7:
My question is does the psu label read 12.33 volts at 150 amps?as that would be 1849.50 wattsyour watt readings were higher.2000-2200 at 125f 1900-2000 at 97fboth exceed that label unless I read it wrong and it reads 12.33 volts at 180 amps which makes a lot more sense as that would be 2215 wattsWhile we don't need 50 units I may want 10-17 units so if someothers want 10-20 usa based maybe 3-5 people could get a 50 pack.

### Reply 8:
12.35 volts and 150 amps is what the sticker says, however it supposedly can adjust in real-time between 12-14.5V and model number suggests it's rated for 2100 watts.

### Reply 9:
I think the first batch shipping is slated July, next batch available is in August. Demo's are live in the wild obviously.

### Reply 10:
okay 2100 works fine.as 14.5 x 150 = 2175 watts.so popcorn is pushing gear hard in a hot room and so far it holds up.that's cool (pun intended).

### Reply 11:
I finally got around to updating the Competitive hardware thread, and linked your review under it. Nice to see Avalons still handle the heat, my 741's were great for that on those bordereline days when I wasn't around to tweak them.

### Reply 12:
Yes sir, it still held up all weekend averaging 30.5-32th/s in +110F temps.The 97F was in an AC'd room however it had poor airflow so I think the area around the miner just warmed up.I believe this it is the PSU supplied by Avalon and I was told it auto adjusted, this is the standard miner so no turbo mode.

### Reply 13:
Looks like we're listing for August on 1041 while it's available.

### Reply 14:
hi guys I am back.we have completed our enviromental testing up to 40C, for all the modes of the miner and yes they can take the heat.More samples should be going out shortly , we had some software tweaks and wanted to test the first few thousand machines in all the modes, especially turbo.We will open up the ordering. Demand is running pretty high, and manufacturers are light on inventory so first come first serve<link>

Bottom line. It is selling out pretty quickly so that now most large customers are pre purchasing Sept/Oct.capacity at the fabs ( TSMC and Samsung) is pretty tight which means NO ONE will be able to build a huge wack of machines ( unlike Q1 and Q2 of 2018 )With Upstream supply tight and BTC mooning even old shitty stuff is flying out the door. We just started selling 850! which is basically 851 that didnt met the spec. Moving like crazy.it looks to me like we will have a repeat of end of 2017 when demand was 10X the supply. If BTC holds or goes higher then you can expect shortages.life in bitcoin, never dull.I will try to reserve some quantity for smaller customers and put some aside for Nick at blokforge. he stuck with bitcoin and us through thick and thin.

### Reply 17:
Ja, it's pretty crazy right now. Glad I ordered my A10 through Blokforge in time for the early July delivery. Speaking of which, any better info on when the early July batch will be shipping?

I would agree with selling. They have a surprising amount of value still. Also people seem to collect the entire color selection. So if you can sell an entire set depending on your colors value might go up.

Topic: Does Asicminer have plans for a more powerful block erupter USB?
### Original post:
The idea of these things is really great. I travel a lot and being able to have one plugged into my laptop would be a great conversation starter about bitcoin and would be something easy to get others interested in it by showing how they can participate with just a tiny little device plugged into a computer. It's just that it would be so much more appealing for the price if it were closer to 1 Gh. Though I am guessing the power draw and heat dissipation needs would be more difficult to manage.

Topic: Why do some S3's overclock and some dont?
### Original post:
Hi guys,Just a curiousity question really. I have an S3 and an S3+ and the S3+ is overclocked to 250freq and has been since I got it. Runs fine only gets the occasional error on one chip every two weeks which a reboot sorts out. The S3 on the other hand wont take even the next freq up without throwing chips left right a centre or not powering a whole board.Now to my question, why are they behaving differently? I know they are made at different times, and are technically different models, but has anyone tracked down or does anyone know why they behave so differently to <truncated>

### Reply 1:
the + are better.batch 1 and batch 2 were bad models they ran at freq 218 and freq 212. the did not do well

### Reply 2:
Not all S3+ are better. I have one that I use in my rig in my shed in the backyard, and it overclocks worse than my s3 that easily does 520gh/s with no x's. I used a 5000rpm pwm as well, so temps aren't that bad. Some batches are just bad and you'll need to try to avoid them if you're buying old miners.

### Reply 3:
Batch 1 was bad enough everyone got partial refund. Some ran up to spec but a lot did not. To avoid this phil is right buy a + model and you should not have to worry about the really bad ones.But S3's had a personality it seemed to me. I always had some better then others and fined tuned each one. But get a + if at alll an option over normal.

### Reply 4:
I had 40-50 s-3's pass through my hands the majority were s+ and most did freq 237 easy some did freq 243 and some did freq 250.Some of the best mining gear ever made. although avalon 4's were the best. for my setup then s-3+'snow I like avalon6 more then s-7

### Reply 5:
Thanks for the replies guys. I'm not looking to buy anymore but if I were I'd keep a look out for a + model and swap out my old normal one with wifi instead.I'm along the same thinking about the personality side of things. Each one is different. But it still doesn't explain why though? Was it down to components used? Programming? Cheers.

### Reply 6:
components and component qualityin mining with gpu'sin intel cpus some clock great some don'twhen chips are made they are not equal.sometimes in gaming gpus you will read that the chips where binned.Simply put tested and sorted by quality.I think the s-3+ varied due to chip quality.There are rare s-3++ machines that where most likely made with binned high quality asics. These were sold mostly in asia.

That's fair enough. I was thinking if it was some kind of programming that it could be altered. Never mind. Thanks for the replies

Topic: Are there any guides on building a mining farm from scratch?
### Original post:
Is it still the wild west when it comes to information on starting a mining farm or is there a formula out there already to do things practically and efficiently?I am curious about things such as obtaining and distributing the power, buying vs leasing commercial property, buying lot vs existing building, most efficient cooling method, layout, etc. Any links to some good guides would be appreciated. Also, if I was to buy a small plot of land and put a shed/container on it, would it be pretty simple to have the power company provide a couple thousand amps or whatever I needed, perhaps I'd buy the transformer or would they want to see construction plans / have a solid structure in place? Basically would they just feed the line wherever I tell them to and then have me deal with an electrician to get the panel installed in the shed?

### Reply 1:
unfortunately I don't know any guide fpr a mining farm but you might refer to high performance compunting datacenter guidlines and whitepapers.there are many variations of ready to use and pre built modular <truncated> from suppliers like dell/emerson with different cooling solutions depending on your environmental setup and region.you might look for a small property near to a tranformer substation so you don't have to pay to much development costs.

### Reply 2:
There are people with this knowledge, but most of us dont give it away for free when we can get paid $150/hour or more to consult on these exact questions.

### Reply 3:
As far as physical design, it's basically setting up a data center and you can learn a lot online about data center construction and design.Other than that, I'd expect you could handle the networking aspects but if not that's another topic to research.But OTOH, look at some of the colo ads - you'll see barns, outbuildings, wire racks in warehouses, reused grain elevators and some nonsense like that. The bottom line seems to be cheap power and a good feed from the utility.

Topic: Hardware ver. x.x.x.x
### Original post:
Hi All,Ok, this is strange....but bear with me. I all of a sudden, have both my miners (S-5's) just show....within 3 hours of each other, Hardware Ver. x.x.x.x on the main status page, and no cg miner version at all.All mining has <truncated> did a search, and all I could really find was a suggestion to do a hard reset of the power, which didn't work.So far, what I've tried (that's all <truncated> off and back onhard reset back to defaultreflash of firmwareNow....what is REALLY weird is that this affected one of the machines first, and after I accepted that this one is dead.....the other one did the exact same thing. How, do two machines that have been running all winter, one inside, one outside in the garage (both blown free of dust weekly), decide to show the same error and die within a few hours of each other?I refuse to accept it's just bad luck. There must be something going on.The ONLY thing that has changed today is I installed a new router in the house. An Asus RT-AC3200. How could a router kill two Antminer S-5's? I don't think it did...but troubleshooting 101.....what changed right before the incident?Any help / guidance would be appreciated.Thanks!

I know this post is a few months old, so I'm sorry for resurrecting it.When I do a search only 2 threads come up, this one and another one. There is no resolution to either poster's problemI am having the same issue with my minersI WAS running an S5, 2 S7-LN's, and an S7In late march/ early April they ALL stopped hashing.The overview page shows ""Hardware Version x.x.x.x""The miner status page is completely blank no info there at all. Chip status, fan speed, pools, all blank.Bitmain Support lists this exact issue on their website under item number 7 I believe and says that the miner has lost its firmware, reload and reboot.Well its not that simple, and it didnt workI have also replaced the BB board, and control board, and imaged several different microSD cards, all with no change in the miner at all. I have even booted them with the hash boards disconnected to try to eliminate them from the equation, with no luck either.I have been communicating with bitmain support which has been helpful, but unproductive.Has anyone else had this issue?Was there ever any resolution?I have already lost 3 months of mining, I would like to get this figured out if anyone can help me trouble shoot please<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 2:
Ok, so I figured it out yesterday. I will post my findings here. Searches on Google bring up this issue on this forum, and several other sites. There is no resolution ever posted. I stumbled across a Russian forum that google stumbled through translating. That person was having the same issue with one of his miners. He moved it to another location for troubleshooting and it worked fine. The only thing that changed according to him was the network. I do not know what network connection has to do with the BB board properly loading firmware and recognizing the connected hash boards but apparently it does. I checked my router, I use an ASUS RT-AC68U, saw there was another firmware update, so I updated. After the update I was checking through some other settings. The log showed the ""AiProtect"" app was blocking malicious activity and sending alert emails. I received no emails of the sort, so that may be another issue. The ip addresses it was blocking were all for my miners. I turned off all settings for the AiProtect app built in to the ASUS router and BAM! green status lights and we're off to the races.So switching off that protection as ASUS calls it and the hardware version on the min<rest of post truncated>

Good to know for future reference, thanks!I'd have to assume that during boot, anytime the miners cannot connect to a pool (in this case blocked by the router) it cannot perform its self-checks and that is why the boot process hangs giving that generic error message.

I thought I had checked that....but I was thinking about it again after bitcoin hit 6K and decided to take another look.....I'm glad I did.I changed out routers and I'm BACK BABY!!!!!!Thanks for catching what I should have.....

### Original post:
Make sure you do your due diligence prior to signing on the dotted line. Make sure you know exactly who you're conducting business with.A quick reminder: <link> June 14, 2006: <link> those not aware, Community Hosting is a company that Josh of BFL owns. The address for the Bryant Building is 1102 GRAND, KC, virtually across the street from where BFL first used as their office/mailing address.Another data center located even closer is 1100 S Walnut, KC. I'll explain the significance of that address in a sec, but first here's the map showing its location in relationship to 25 E 12th St., KC, BFL's address still used on BitPay's site.Note the 1102 Grand address in the image above, better showcased below:The Zaina restaurant could be seen from the 1100 S Walnut St. address.It's common knowledge that these addresses are related: <link> you can see, the relationship between Josh, Aaron and Joe stem over seven years.Josh has been hosting FPGAs at at least one of the above addresses for over a year. Do you really believe he's going to give up such a lucrative endeavor to J. Morgan and Associates, or is it more likely that Josh, Aaron and Joe make up said endeavor?

Morgan & Associates hosting service or not, I don't know. If he is, that would be a plus.

### Reply 8:
Josh is already hosting at one of the mentioned data center of which he owns. Three of the data center addresses mention on the KCIX site are literally within walking distance from each other. It would take less than ten minutes to walk from any one of them to the other two and BFL's original address, physically touching all four buildings.The only thing that I haven't figured out YET is how BFL is able to collect the mail addressed to 25 E. 12th St. without a suite number.

Josh even stated in no uncertain terms that if you have reservations about hosting on his Eclipse MC pool, he'll be happy to create another pool for you to do such. It's akin to either hosting the physical units at his data center, or another of which he has a direct relationship with its proprietors.How happy is BFL with such a setup?<link>

Hello,I wanted to clarify some things that are being said or at least insinuated here. My name is Joe Morgan I own and operate both Joe's Datacenter, LLC and J Morgan & Associates, LLC (aka kcmocolo.com). They are separate companies with separate facilities but I use one address for mailing. I am the SOLE owner of both company's and have no affiliation with Butterfly Labs other than they are sending their customers to us for hosting as they decided not to do it themselves. I cannot speak for BFL or Josh as to where he has hosted in the past but I will say that almost anything hosted in Kansas City is going to be in one of three or four buildings downtown all within a couple blocks of eachother. You could find hundreds of hosting companies that show one of those buildings as their address or as a place they host and they are still completely different companies. Josh has never been an employee or part owner of any of my companies and is not on the payroll. Aaron owns another datacenter in Kansas City and we have both had facilities in the same buildings but otherwise we are unaffiliated as well.

### Original post:
How noisy is the A741 compared to the S9?

### Reply 1:
What is your ambient temperature?You can use -2 voltage and with 28C intake it will run similar to a 290X reference model at 70% fan, if not less.Under that temp, it really becomes silent.You can probably force the fan setting, and also replace it with something more silent, but I have no need for low noise.I have it hosted so I'm honestly not too good at this, but just checked and 290X at 70% is best I can do.I could sleep with one in a bedroom, but not 9, though I think heat at that point would be the issue haha.

### Reply 2:
The s9 is say 75db vs the 741 is 72 dbBut the s9 has nasty pitch .And some times a fucking whistle sound that is really bad. I suspect it is due to the heatsinks used inside.Many are offset .The s9 is pretty much a pos compared to the Avalon 741.But if you get a good one that does not break they are better.Of the 11 I have had .four have not had any issues in a year. The other 7 needed repairs.

I still stick with Bitcoin, although I have put a few Radeon cards in my PC for mining when i'm not using it. I still enjoy ASIC mining but I fear it's slowly coming to an end for us home miners and the big corporations and farms will centralize the entire mining business (As we can already see with Bitmain and Avalon distributing the only 'effective' ASICs now).

### Reply 7:
That is part of what I like about Canaan, so far they have proven themselves to be easier to deal with than Asus, Gigabyte, and Sapphire (All 3 GPU cards died even before mining, only 2 RMAs were passed and it was months of work).I highly support GPU mining as well, looking into buying something well made and for GPU mining in a more elegant fashion than a rack of GPU raisers dangling and caseless motherboards.Canaan took me about 5 minutes of work and not a satoshi out of my wallet.Is this sustainable? I hope so, because I plan on sticking with them with this customer satisfaction.A741 on 6.5cent electric is pretty nice, especially on a pool paying out transaction fees.My failure rates with the S9 were about as bad as Philipma, and I know they take good care of their miners with lots of experience.That's not good for clearing 100% ROI.Out of 10 Canaan miners, 1 failure, (and before Bitmain has even responded to my delay PSU shipment which is another story), the replacement was shipped by Canaan.I'll be out a PSU for them crazy enough, wasn't expecting it to be so fast.Will power down a bad S7 for it.Someone else may be better about sound mods, I know it could be better than an S7 <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 8:
Agree with all except:Speaking as a person who designs/builds high power electronics for a living, *why* do folks constantly seem to think they can make a better decision about cooling/fans than the OEM did?Canaan did even more research into that than Bitmain (who just went for brute force) did. Read the bit on Canaan's site about it then look at the innards of your 721/741 miner to find out how they reduced the noise.That said, as with Bitmains s7 on up and applying equally to the Avalon's, IF you are going to play with fans at least make sure they are rated to work against high static-pressure. Most lower noise ones are not and will not deliver enough or at best will deliver only barely enough airflow even with a miner throttled down. In short - expect marginal performance....

### Reply 9:
I've known this for a long time if you track my posts (who would?). I'm still profitable as my electrical cost is right around six cents per kilowatt and I probably will be for a long time. POW change is an option but with centralization Jihan will make some chess pieces move and block that out. My mining rigs haven't broken down yet and I still actively buy miners and use them, GPUs also have risk involved, albeit much less.

I agree they designed these things by default perfect for my setup and anyone who can tolerate expected fan noise.As stated I have no need for silent operations so don't have any first hand experience, but I do see people constantly <truncated> units, some for a living, for home mining and basically costing performance in exchange for lower fan noise, at<rest of thread truncated>

Topic: question about s17/s19 hashboard configuration/operation
### Original post:
so, this might sound weird, but allow me to explain a bit first, I cram miners in where ever I can, at the office, in the shed, even paid hosting, so I look for different solutions to my issues.so at my home/office, I want small power (wattage) BTC units, so what I have done is acquired s9's, and unplugged 2 of the hashboards, so it runs on one, then I can turn the fans down so it runs at around 400w, and I get winter heating, so all is good, so I need an upgrade, but how many hash boards are in the s17/s19 units, and can it operate with only one hashboard in it? how much hashing power is in one PCB? and roughly what would be the power draw of said board?I was looking for under hashing units, as they come cheaply sometimes here, and wondered if they will fit the bill for next years winter.any info on this would be good, everyone is talking about getting the best from these units, I actually need the worst from them lol.thanks.

### Reply 1:
All the S17 series (normal, pro, +, and E) have 3 hashboards and they will operate with fewer if you unplug the data cable for hashboards you want to disable. S19 should be the same although I haven't actually seen one yet.For a plain S17, 1 hashboard does 16 to 19 TH at around 45W/TH, so 720W to 855W per hashboard.Not likely to find any at reasonable prices though. And be warned that the 17 series had a lot of quality control issues so high failure rate.

### Reply 2:
If you do this, you'll want to block the airflow around the board. The heatsinks rely on high flow to keep chips cool so if your air is going around the board instead of being forced through the fins it'll overcook.You should look into braiins or vnish firmwares that allow you to adjust the voltage and frequency of the S9. You could get a unit down around 400W and quiet but still operating well upwards of 5TH. Better than one board at stock speed.

### Reply 3:
thanks guys, good info there wndsnb, and yes sidehack, that's pretty much what I have running now, its not that good, around 4.2TH for just over 400w, I cant balance the voltage and frequency for a stable rig.I will still keep an eye out for a newer system tho, maybe a s15, and mod that, still twice as efficient as a s9.

If what you've done is, as you've said, unplug two boards and run on one, then no what I suggested is not what you're doing.

Hello! Ive been running a S9 miner and had no issues with it until last night.Everything was fine until yesterday. I was averaging 13.6 Th and then it went down to 500 Gh over night. I tried resetting and that didn't work. I tried updating the firmware and that didn't workI then started checking each hashboard. I have found that when I power up two boards it gives me 10.1 Th but when I do all 3 it only gives me 500 Gh.If you have the S9 antminer sitting on a table with the ethernet port facing you the board on the FAR LEFT seems to be the problem. Here are my results of testing.When powering the MIDDLE board only I get 5.1 Th and the temperature reads correctlyWhen powering the FAR RIGHT board only I get 5.1 Th and the temperature reads correctlyWhen powering the MIDDLE and FAR RIGHT board I get 10 Th. and the temperature reads correctlyWhen ONLY powering the FAR LEFT board I get 1.1Th and the temperature DOES NOT READ CORRECTLYWhen powering ANY COMBINATION WITH the FAR LEFT board INCLUDED I only get 500 gh and the temperature DOES NOT READ AT ALLWhen powering ALL THREE I get 500 Gh and the temperature DOES NOT READ AT ALLI have tried all the different combinations of power connect<rest of post truncated>

Topic: new electric setup: 1-phase vs 3-phase
### Original post:
This question has been asked a couple times with variations and I haven't quite got an answer so I'm posting this here.I found a small shop to use for mining, aiming for about 150kw total 24/7 power draw. I'm discussing with TDU and electrician about setup but neither of them are very helpful in giving advice for what I need. Their attitude is mostly just like ""just tell us what you need and we'll do it"". The shop has a small 1 phase 200 amp panel, but they are willing to make the upgrades.From my research, it seems the question of 3-phase vs 1-phase delivery just comes down to cost. All mining hardware uses 1 phase but still many people seem to recommend to go with 3 phase because of reduced delivery costs. I'm not 100% sure the reason for this, so that is part of my question. Secondly, I might be able to take the panel and any other electrical equipment from the shop with me to later expand, so if 3 phase isn't strictly neccesary, maybe it is a good investment anyways?Anyway my main question here is, should I give the TDU a load sheet requesting 3-phase power or just 1-phase? Any advice on this is appreciated because I am really unsure.Thanks.

### Reply 1:
Why would anyone recommend 3 phase over a single phase for mining? it really makes no difference, since you are going to be using nothing but PSUs that need only a single phase.Remember that by the end of the day you will be using 3*single phase which is just like running 3 separate single-phase wires, what you should focus on are only the total allowance and the cost.You tell your electric guy that you need for example 100kw at 220v in the cheapest form possible, I don't know about the cost in your country but I'd say a single-phase set-up would be cheaper.I have 3 phase but only because I really don't have any other option, the nearest supply I have is 3 phase 11KV, so I have an 11KV to 380V (3 phase) transformer (the only type of transformers available here), it does come in handy sometimes, for example, I was able to get some 3 phase exhaust fans ( certainly a lot more robust than a single-phase fans) but I then have to worry about load balancing and shit, so with everything else equal, a single-phase will be it for me.

### Reply 2:
150kw is getting into 3-phase territory but still very practical for single phase service. It comes down to cost of the panel (size and amount of copper in it) and if the power company needs to supply you with a different service transformer to feed the building. As Mikey said, go with what is cheaper.

### Reply 3:
Is drawing 150kw on a single phase an issue for the TDU since it is extremely unbalanced on the transmission lines, right?

### Reply 4:
I assume that ""TDU"" is your utility supplying power to the building?If so, yes and no. Yes it is a load on only 1-phase of their (usually 3-phase) transmission lines BUT it is their job to monitor the lines and divvy up the loads on them between you and other customers so no it should not really be an issue for them.If you are in North America, depending on what kind of power is needed for other businesses nearby, their '3-phase' may not exactly true 3-phase but rather 3-phase created by using a 'wild leg' as referenced to Neutral. Voltage across all 3 or any 2 lines is the same. Voltage from either L1 or L2 referenced to Neutral is balanced to 1/2 the L1-L2 voltage. For 208 VAC that is 110V for L1 or L2 to Neutral. Voltage on the 3rd or Wild leg referenced to Neutral is much because it is is NOT reference to Neutral. The 3rd leg is supplied only to places needing 3-phase to run motors, refrigeration, and other application requiring it that are powered by all three phases. If that is the case the utility is already supplying single phase power over very heavy lines feeding several other locations nearby.Would they prefer a load split across all 3-phases? Sure, but it should make no<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 5:
Are you just saying that the TDU should be able to balance things on their side easier than I make it seem?Also, you're not referring to ""high-leg delta"" voltage are you? I am considering requesting 240 3 phase in the delta config:This setup is as true of 3 phase as 120/208 right?

### Reply 6:
You're over-thinking things....Unless you are pulling mega-watts of power, load balance on the utilities transmission lines is not your concern. If you have 3-phase power you only have to reasonably balance power from your distribution panel. If you have single-phase power it is still the utilities concern - not yours. Of course this also assumes that you are in a fairly well developed country with stable & modern power grids.In most countries 3-phase is typically delivered to a building as a wye connection with a center Neutral connection - not delta. However, that also depends on the local power loads. Wild leg or high leg grounded delta is usually only found where most area loads are sin<rest of thread truncated>

Topic: Cost to Mine 1 BTC in every country
### Original post:
Just came across this, published last month, but don't recall seeing anything like it on the forum, so just sharing.Original article by 911 Metallurgist, it's got the rates for some other crypto too but I'm just going to share the one for Bitcoin: Cost to mine 1 Bitcoin in every country.I knew Asia was expensive, but not THAT expensive. Also, I think this is the cost of grid electricity. I know in my part of the world, for example, some miners want to experiment with natural gas generators. Far, far cheaper, no one would plug into the grid!Kuwait, though!

### Reply 1:
This is a very interesting graphic since it shows at what price a miner would be selling his coins for and therefore it does influence the market quite a lot. What I think is a big problem is that they don't show the power costs that they actually used to calculate this. In many countries the cost of power can be very different for companies and private persons, so if they don't say the calculate with for example 0,25 USD per KWH then its is not as helpful as it could have been.

### Reply 2:
But the methodology is based on cost of power -- you can open the original link shared and dig in deeper. Which is why I commented that this pricing isn't entirely accurate, it's only based on commercial consumption cost by directly connecting to power grids. As you know, not all miners would do that, and not all miners pay the same rates -- like it used to be in China, where they'd be able to negotiate independent rates with state energy providers. If the other stats are true (like from Bitcoin Policy Institute numbers) then most miners already are on renewables and alternative energy sources -- so I doubt most of them are paying these rates.The data's just indicative of how much you'd pay if you just decided to plug in and mine.

### Reply 3:
And at least for the US it's using numbers that are very distorted and many times flat out incorrect. Many states have different prices for power in different areas. Discounts for agreed contracted amounts and tons of other variables. There are other countries that power is cheap but unreliable, I mean they put in North Korea where most people don't have power and except for limited exceptions it's not reliable. Pretty map but pointless in the end. Not to mention as we all know electricity although a big part is only 1 part of the cost.-Dave

### Reply 4:
This is very good information. to mine crypto in the developing should be the number one place mining should be very costly but from the link you provided, it looks as if they are even more less. mostly Nigeria, which I know very sure that they have not slept with 24/7 hours light and the Map esteemated it as $22.303. This amount for Nigeria is confusing me because if it is power that is used to determine the cost of mining then Nigerian should be even the number one in the list. Africa is blessed with natural resources even gas but irony is the case.

### Reply 5:
This whole study is bullshit, electricity price in Kuwait is 6.5 cents per kWh for ""undefined manufacturing"" which is where bitcoin falls under, which means even while using the most advanced gear you are nowhere near the 1.4k cost mentioned in this ""study"".Using the household prices it ranges from 1.6 cents to 5 cents, but long story short, once you pass 9 KWh a MONTH (which every asic miner will do in a few hours) you jump to the 5 cents tier, the 1.6 cents is for below 3 kWh a month, that isn't enough to mine a fraction of bitcoin, but ya, I understand why they had these numbers incorrect, most people who write such content are lazy, and they still get paid for writing nonsense like that.I don't know the prices of other countries mentioned in the study, but I am sure that most will be incorrect, so it's safe to assume that this whole thing is just b.s.

### Reply 6:
Agreed and since it's just talking about electric rates it leaves off a lot of other factors, some of which Phil touched on above and others that I have discussed in the past. Climate plays a large part. It's better to pay more for electric and mine in a cooler environment to keep cooling costs down vs. cheaper rates but keeping the chillers running full blast all the time. Reliability and cost of internet. Yes most of us here can run our miners off of a cable modem or whatever. The big players have multiple fiber connections and run their own BGP.And so on.-Dave

Topic: Is there a way to disable one hashboard on Whatsminer M30s?
### Original post:
So we have multiple m30s units that have a problem with one hashboard. Something like 'error 542- Slot 2 loss balance'.Miners with this type of issue, seems to get into a never ending, restart loop and don't hash on any hashboard, even though the problem is with just one board. We realized that we can physically remove the problem hashboard from the miner, and then the unit starts hashing on the remaining 2 hashboards. However physically removing hashboards takes time, and messes up the air flow dynamics inside the unit. Anyone know if there's an easier way to 'disable' one problem hashboard on whatsminers without having to physically remove the hashboard.

### Reply 1:
I never heard if there is a tool to disable one hashboard.So I guess the only way to disable it is by physically removing it from the unit.There is no problem disassembling the unit just make sure do not rush and clean them and assemble them properly.

### Reply 2:
Hi, I have the same problem (Error Code 542). I took it out the SM2 Hashboard, and now the miner is mining (66%), but I notice the fan-in and fan-out speed are faster than before. Do you have the same problem? Can you repair the hashboard?. Thank you in advance.

### Reply 3:
On that error code, I think it's related to an ASIC Chip and maybe one of the Chip is broken. Did you get this error after you remove the hashboard? Or did you get this error with or without the SM2 hashboard as you said?If you get the error after the hashboard is removed then try to replug the other hashboard and check the cable if it was plugged properly then test it again. But if you receive the error with or without the hashboard then find the broken hashboard that cause that issue and remove it and then you can look for a repair center near you from this link below.- <link>

### Reply 4:
Unfortunately, there is no way on the software level for this, if you want to maintain the same airflow then I'd imagine the only way is to seal/isolate some of the pins on the adapter plate that connects the bad hashboard, this way the miner would think the board is not attached and won't do go into an endless loop. Meanwhile, you could ask their support here > <link> , maybe, they have made a new update in regards to this issue, but as far as I know and up to my most recent updates, there is none.

Topic: Antminer S9 breakdown issues - How frequent?
### Original post:
I just wanted to get a sense of what percentage of these units break down.I had one running for exactly 7 days and 2 boards went out.Under warranty, but Bitmain says to expect 3-4 weeks turnaround on repairs.Basically losing 5 weeks of hashing at the peak of it's diminishing value.

### Reply 1:
Saw this in the main S9 board today.

### Reply 2:
Your best bet would be to look at the main thread.What is with everyone starting a new S9 thread lately every time they have a question and simply figure everyone will give them the answer? Lazyness?

### Reply 3:
Wanted to open up discussions. I already read what was there. It seems to be yet another hurdle to ROI if you need to figure out the downtime of repairing under warranty. Also It would be nice to get perspective on repairs from bitmainwarranty in the US. I spent over $100USD to ship back to HongKong and it took 6 days. I'm wondering how much it would have cost to pay out of pocket in comparison to international shipping and lost weeks. bitmainwarranty would not quote me without the machine shipped to them.

### Reply 4:
I'd rather expect this to happen to all repairs involving batch-16 and higher (auto-tune rigs) and sounds like same for the R4.Chips/boards that perform near perfect are rare. Call it curse of 16/14nm. That said, the point of autotune is so Bitmain can pick and choose between 'meh' and better boards so the miner as a whole gives advertised hash rate. They don't want to use a better board than needed nor send out a weak sister one when it was a better board that croaked.

### Reply 5:
I did notice all three boards had a very wide variance of frequencies to yield 11/th. Guess I was better off if I chose the 14/th S9 as it must have performed optimally at the spec frequency. One board was always consistently hitting 97-107 deg (fastest clock speed), while the other two were consistently fluctuating between 79-87 deg.The slowest frequency autotune board was the one to survive though. Just got the update 5 calendar days after EMS reported delivered, that the ticket status was changed from ""uncollected"" to ""collected"". A follow up email stated that the S9 will be repaired under warranty and turned around in 3 business days.

### Reply 6:
I seem to get lucky on bitmain gear because my failure rate has been low for the few S5/S7/S9 that I have owned. I have a few S9s and the only ones I have had a problem with were the two 11Ths units I bought. They still work with all 3 boards but sometimes they only run at 7-8Ths. A quick hard reboot always does the trick. This low hashing problem only happens after they reset for some reason like loosing internet for a second. I may have just been lucky so far.

### Reply 7:

The first time i opened my miner I shook my head at the 100% lack of thought that went into the performance of cooling. Purely cost effective for them. If anyone has a dead s9 board they dont mind donating to the cause im more then happy to see if a water block is a possibility. Biggest concern is removing the dollar store heatsinks they seemed to have welded on.

### Reply 12:
Actually I have been wondering about Bitmain's devices. Would it be worth it to ship units to me for repair (not affiliated with Bitmain at all, if they wanted to send me schematics that would be nice) for a lower time to repair?If so I'll look into their next unit and see what it would take to fix failures. But maybe the failure rate is low enough/the warranty is strong enough for this to not make sense?C

### Reply 13:
So total turnaround from shipping via USPS from NYC and them sending back* was 2.5 weeks. However, I received a brand new 12/TH S9 to replace my defective 11/TH. Serial numbers, firmware corroborated.The new 12/TH has been running flawlessly 24/7 for almost 3 weeks.In retrospect it would have been worth it to pay for repairs at bitmainwarranty.com as the shipping out cost and lost mining time probably was about the same as what they would have charged for an out of warranty repair. But it appears that they replace units too according to other forum threads I've read. Must be Bitmain or have a very close association with them since their help desk software was exactly the same.

### Reply 14:
Bitmainwarranty is in some kind of business partnership with bitmain .They have two or three locations outside China to do repairs.They are better if you have out of warranty gear and live in the lower forty eight states.

So each 1BTC invested should equal 256/50 = 5.12 Gh/s is this right?

### Reply 2:
to be honest it depends on the btc course at the day of purchase.I think 1 btc should result even more than 5.12 Gh/s something even about 5.50 Gh/s maybe

Will you take USD paypal payment for shares?

yes I will, PM for details

A few questions..Has the machine already been ordered? Estimated arrival date?Also, will the miner be hosted at a datacenter, someone's private residence, somewhere else?thanks.

### Reply 6:
The machine is not ordered yet, we are still collecting funds.The miner will be hosted at datacenter with all the other mining hardware.

Topic: KNC Miner [NEPTUNE 3000GHS] GROUP BUY ALL SOLDOUT
### Original post:
The Neptune for this GROUP Buy has been paid. It's one of the earliest orders and a DAY One order so we are sure to be one of the first to get the units. If you are considering other groupbuys, please ask them if their Neptune unit has been paid for. All orders that were not paid has been canceled by KncMiner. Also ask them if their unit is part of the Batch 1 group as the second batch is expected to arrive 3-4 weeks after the First batch. 3-4 weeks of lost revenue could mean thousands of lost $$$. Due to BTC recent price fall, the price per share is now .55 BTC. All previous orders will retain their share rights. All new share purchases will need to send .55 BTC per share. Date and time stamp is: December 02, 2013, 11:21:24 AM Groupbuy 1 - SOLDOUTGroupbuy 2 - SOLDOUTGroupbuy 3 - SOLDOUT This group buy is intended to let forum members take part in the opportunity to purchase cheap hash-rate through the recently launched KNC Miner Neptune(<link> company located in Stockholm, Sweden. The unit that the shares relate to is the KNC Neptune advertised for 3,000 GH/s (<link> Why trust me? I've previously had a group buy with the last KNCminers and all members received their fair share as <rest of post truncated>

Looking forward to delivery. Thanks for all your hard work and time spent setting this all up Charles...Got any pics of past mining rigs or of the room that will be housing this incoming rig?What moves are you making right now to get all set up for this inconming equipment?Oh, and... Anyone who wants to get out, message me with an offer and I'll take your shares.Chapps

### Reply 2:
I have a question. Where (location) will the equipment will be hosted? Is the location a known datacenter?

### Reply 3:
TOP Secret information! Just know that it'll be a cold room and there will be plenty of power in the room. Only thing I am awaiting is the specs on what type of power supply I will need for each unit. Hope it doesn't require more than 2 power supply per unit. I hate having an ugly server room with wires running all over the place. So far I haven't heard any request for a refund. I do still check my charles999 account. These mods don't like to respond to messages I write them so doesn't look like that account is going to be unlocked from sending messages Just message me if you need to get a hold of me. I don't check the thread too much as there's nothing to post here until there's new KNC news.

### Reply 4:
I did not want to know the actual location. My question was informational as to if you , for instance, work in a datacenter and can/will utilize that space or you have a computer room with servers and will use that.

### Reply 5:
Do we expect more groupbuys organized here?

### Reply 6:
@stergium - Yes, it'll be in a datacenter along with my other units. @maco - Sorry, no more shares will be offered for the Neptunes. If anyone wants to get out of their shares, i will buy it back from them.

It looks like due the power reduction from their first test units means they are reworking the batches to conform to this improved power consumption. Plus they are reworking their hosting options.

### Original post:
For the first time even the mining pool I use, btcmine.com had what appears to be a ASIC mining running as one user on the top mining board got over 60,000MH/s.So anyone got a guess how many ASIC devices are out there right now in operation? If you do try and show some working out of how you got to you conclusion

### Reply 1:
Butterfly Labs are probably using several ASIC devices...

### Reply 2:
bfl are using avalons in order to prop up their overspending

### Reply 3:
In wouldn't like to take a guess but its getting harder and harder on my gpu's!

### Reply 4:
Back in February, before the first ASICMINER chips went into production which was just before the first two Avalon ASICs shipped, there were 22 Thash/s of capacity. Today there is 85 Thash/s. Even with the rising exhange rate, there is likely less GPUs mining bitcoins today than in February since there was probably more that defected to Litecoin (due to Litecoin mining being a little more profitable than Bitcoin mining even, over the past couple months) than came online since February. And almost nobody is buying FPGAs anymore. So it is probably safe to conclude that about 63 Thashs/s of ASIC mining capacity has come online. I don't know the distribution as far as how much is ASICMINER's that they are using for their own mining, versus the shipments of Avalon ASICs and BFLs.If that capacity were all Avalon ASICs, that 63 Thash/s would represent about a thousand units (and they've not shipped anywhere near that).

### Reply 5:
I think this springs rally and spike in interest has brought a lot of new GPU miners and they're quite a few people still buying FPGA's. KNCMiner is about to release a new FPGA - <link> - but yes I don't think most of the new growth was GPU/FPGA but probably a fare bit of it was.

Topic: TTL USB BASICS - MinerMEDIC HOWTO
### Original post:
One to the most basic tools every <truncated> must have for troubleshooting is a TTL to USB interface converter. This is the USB device that provides all mining machine control boards a way to communicate with the outside world when all else fails (read ethernet network). The TTL Serial interface, TX/GND/RX for Zynq based units, Pin 1(GND), Pin 4,(RX), Pin 5(TX) on BeagleBone Black based units, is the most basic, most reliable way to communicate with any CPU. Internally this function is provided to the CPU by a piece of technology called a UART, so you'll se it referred to by that name too. The data emanating from the TX pin starts flowing almost immediately upon startup and contains almost the same data contained in the kernel log but provides it way before the web interface has been initialized, Plus it is live( thus never requiring a ""refresh""). All these reasons are why a Serial/UART/TTL to USB connection will always be used in troubleshooting if you have any expectation of a positive outcome.To capture the data streaming in from the TTL wire to your USB converter and display it on your computer screen you need a terminal program .There are Sooooo many terminal software package<rest of post truncated>

Topic: Need help with cgminer-api
### Original post:
Hello everyone,I'm tinkering around a cgminer implementation on bitmain asic mining firmwares that is driving me crazy. I have two questions. I hope some of you may help me sort out what I'm getting wrong. If i query cgminer-api pools the system counts an overall of 6 pools, but in the following details in the 'cgminer-api pools' result I see only 4 pools, not 6. 1. Are the remaining 2 hidden or it is some kind of malfunction?Also I'm going nuts trying to find the correct syntax for 'cgminer-api removepool' or 'cgminer-api disablepool'. 'cgminer-api pools' Reports pools from no. 0 to no 3. If I try 'cgminer-api disablepool 1' for example I get invalid argument error for the disablepool command. From some research it seems I should be using some pool ID in the disablepool or remove pool commands, but i cant find this pool id information anywhere.2. What am i doing wrong in using these commands? Does anyone of you guys have any suggestions? Thank you so much, its been over a week now I'm stuck at this! Francesco

### Reply 1:
Based on what I heard that cgminer api pools command it is a known issue that these commands you mention above do not work but try to read this one on how to use it- <link> not try other OS like Braiins OS to try those API commands available on Braiins OS you can read this <link> can also try HiveOS they do have more options on their web interface and I think you can achieve what you want to achieve in your ASIC unit.

### Reply 2:
Thank you very much Bitmaxz for your kind reply.That line you linked on api-readme regards the API groups. In the group I'm using I'm allowed to use all pool related commands. as a matter of fact I receive invalid argument, not forbidden, as a reply.Braiinsos has a terrible mining engine running at over 10c more than cgminer at same performance levels. Also it is much less stable than cgminer. Hiveos is very poor in programming quality, i.e. it throttles fans according to pcb temps not chip temps (LOL).Any other ideas? Thanks friends

### Reply 3:
What is the exact unit model of your machine?How do you send these API commands?Note that all bitmain units are API restricted or it has limited function. So if the commands that you want to make it work but do not work you can try access SSH and send that command there.

### Reply 4:
As the API-README states, you can't change settings in the miner without privs enabled in the miner for your IP address.You may have read access due to the settings, but not 'write' access. Read the W: part.The default settings in the miner are up to whoever provided you with the firmware.P.S. linking to an old out of date git isn't the best idea See my sig. I wrote the API and the manual.

### Reply 5:
Thank you very much Kano and Bitmax for your kind replies. Have 2 new babies in the house and I don't have access to pc often these days. Here are my replies to each of your questions and feebacks.To Kano: I studied the api-readme, I have the commands enabled in my api group. As a matter of fact when I issue the command via SSH I do not get forbidden reply from the api, I receive the missing pool ID reply. I do not use W: group as I had some issues in understanding what IP where my commands being received from, so I changed the default api group adding the commands I needed and it seems to be working fine. I know you wrote the api and the readme, so I'm honored you are actually replying to me in person! To Bitmaxz: I am working on several machine types (bitmain Antminer L3+, t17, s17, if I can make the few changes I need I would really need also to extend the work to s19). I send the commands via ssh interface.Thank you so much for your help!Francesco

Open up router and look at connected devices assuming you are using 192.168.1.* and miner is to it will show in device list.That is easiest way to find it. Using nmap not knowing what your doing i highly don't suggest. If use wrong IP your scanning the internet. Reading your post i think device list is where you should look at not run a IP scanning tool.

Looking at pictures of Ebay auction at least one is a standard 4 blade dragon. It looks like there are different models of A1's on auction. (different vendors)You could try to flash a second SD card with a firmware for a dragon with known IP and see if that works. Again I say flash a second SD card since you should keep the original.

Do you know of a page with a walkthrough on that? Also is there a way to change to IP address of new miner to the IP of the old miner? That would be great!

### Reply 8:
Yes it's on hardware forum. If you search there is a Dragon guide. The is one by pcfli with instructions I know because I uploaded a image to it . If you search you will find it and instructions, make sure to use 2nd sd card 8 GB or bigger with it. Don't use original as if this dosent work we want to still have that card.

I don't know any freight forwarder in China but I think I know a person who can help you and I think he can also help you to find a company that sells miners near your location. Try to contact this man offordscott or join to his telegram here <link>

Quick question. Are you talking about alot of machines, because when you say mining machine, is that just like 1 or 2 or even 10? or like 200?If you are talking 10 or so, just let the seller arrange through a local shipping house. They usually use DHL or UPS and air freight it. I get ASIC miners via air cargo all the time.If you are talking about a full container, or even a partial container, then you need a freight coordinator. I moved a 40' container with a transformer this way. I can give you the contact but clarify at which scale you are talking.

Topic: What is the average lifespan of an ASIC miner ?
### Original post:
Hi,Suppose that Asic miner is working 24/24 and 7/7 in normal conditions with free electricityWhat is the average Hardware lifespan ? I will appreciate any documentation about this Thanks

### Reply 1:
Free electricity is irrelevant and by design miners are intended to run 24x7x365.That said, it depends on the make and model. If kept reasonably clean and ran in reasonable temperatures the Avalons from Canaan can easily last many many years. I have over a dozen A841's from 2018 that are still running perfectly with zero maintenance (but in clean environment).Miners from Bitmain are more of a crapshoot. I have a R4 from 2017 that still runs flawlessly and 2 others that died in about 2 years. Early s9's were near bullet-proof up to around batch-9, later ones up to a 15-20% failure rate within 2-3 years OR LESS.

### Reply 2:
There is no answer to this question, and am pretty sure you won't find any documented studies in that regard, the ASIC mining industry is relatively new, and gears become obsolete quite too often, so they switch hands very fast from the ones who have high power rate to those who pay less until it eventually ends up in the hands of those who have free power or the gear could be scrapped.With that in mind, most used gears have little to no information on them, you buy a used gear that has changed hands a couple of times until it got to the seller, you don't know if it has been mining for a month or a year, and thus whatever numbers you get to will be far from accurate.The second issue is the fact that the quality of every mining gear is very different, every model is different, and even within the same model every batch will be different, you are talking about Chinese manufacturers that have little to no quality control, so if you ask me about Bitmain failure rate regarding the 17 series, It has now easily passed 80% failure rate in less than 2 years, if you ask phill he got lucky the s17 pro version and has almost no failure rate, we bought the same gears, probably a few months apar<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 3:
Mikey brings up a good point talking about miners being resold possibly multiple times: You included the point of ""free electricity"" in the OP. The only reason that should matter is if you are getting used & older, less power efficient, hardware. Point being the question for you that should bring is, ""the hardware is x years old, how much longer will it last?""Are you looking at using/getting old to very old gear?

### Reply 4:
Well, of the thousands I've seen and heard about in the past, most last quite a lot longer than just 1 year, and indeed the older Canaan miners have a reasonably good record compared to many other miners.Of course there will be some % that will not survive that, but that % can also depend on other factors.One (small) factor that I would suggest, over the last few years, is that more BM miners have been treated worse than before, due to people over clocking them and destroying them much faster, then selling them off, if they still work, to some sucker who may have been ignorant of this going on with every after market firmware that exists.To understand this for anyone who's not sure about what that means: it's very much like if someone wanted a great GPU for gaming, then bought it 2nd hand from someone who had it running 24/7, hot, mining some scamcoin for 6 or more months, you'd pity anyone who would buy that card 2nd hand, since you would certainly expect a shorter life for it, compared to someone playing games with it even daily for 6 months.

### Reply 5:
Yes I'm going to Re-use old miners

### Reply 6:
Thank you all for these answers. So when you said a miner is dead, this means that probably ( with high probability ) one or more sha256 chips are KO. Is this chip the most fragile component on a miner? and overclocking them reduce drastically their lifespan ?Are there other reasons that reduce the lifespan?

### Reply 7:
There are other components that fail, but most of the time is a dead chip or a few of them, if you think that is a small problem which can be easily and cheaply fixed then you need to do more research, the average fix for a chip would be in the $100 range including labor, of course it depends on where you live, but if you are going to buy a used gear for $400 today, chances are by the time it needs fixing you can buy it for $200, fixing a single chip for $100 or even $50 does not make any sense, so more often than not and especially with the old gears, once a single chip dies, the whole board is rendered dead as far as logic is concerned.Another common issue would be the PSU, many gears are known to have fragile PSU, and the problem is, most gears today don't use a universal 12v PSU which you can buy of anywhere, they rather use their own designed built-in PSU which in most cases are hard to find, many people have perfectly working miners that ne<rest of thread truncated>

Topic: Avalon 741 - Wifi via USB with aerial
### Original post:
I tried to search on google also here in the forum but I don't see any procedure to make the USB wifi work on Avalon controller. It needs an extra driver and I think it is not compatible with Avalon OS. My suggestion if you want to extend your wifi range to reach your Avalon controller much better to buy a wifi repeater.

Yep,wifi repeaters is the way to go.You can also see if ""wireless mesh"" would be ideal for you.<link> also powerline ethernet is one option.<link>

hello everyone,i'm setting up my avalon 741 a long way from the router so i have enabled wifi mode. The rasp3 wifi is not strong enough to reach my routers signal so i have connected a USB wifi dongle with an extended wifi cable/aerial.but how i can i ensure the rasp3 uses my usb wifi and does not attempt to use the onboard wifi chip? is it possible to install the USB drivers into the controller OS?thank youzac

### Reply 3:
thank you for your replyzac

### Reply 4:
I'm using a NETGEAR N300 WiFi Range Extender (EX2700) 32.99 at Amazon, to provide internet to my S7 miners at my cabin just to keep the cabin warm. It is much easier than running CAT 5 cable and it works great. Just plug in a short ethernet cable between the Netgear and your Pi, no drivers needed.

### Reply 5:
there should be away around this, but it really isn't worth the hustle, you either use what the other guys suggested or better yet run an Ethernet cable.since your usb wifi can catch the signal from the router then the distance is not that much, depending on what there is on the way from the miner to the router i highly suggest using a CAT6 cable to run your miner, wifi is not a robust connection that you can depend on for 24/7 , imagine you solo mine and once your miner finds a block , some signal interference happens and it fails to broadcast it. it is really not worth it to run a miner on wifi even if it works for everybody that you know, all you need a little bit of bad luck to be screwed.should you insist on using wifi, use something like vistumbler to identify the best wifi channel to use according to your environment, this minimizes the interference possibilities , most wifi's run on channel 1/6 but it depends, just scan and see.also make sure you using 2.4 GHz if you have more obstacles to go through. 5 GHz routers provide faster transmission but they don't do well in long range.

### Reply 6:
thank you everyone. I have decided to run an ethernet cable. its going to be a big job to get it to where i need it but i think its worth it.

### Reply 7:
just ensure you are not running the cable close to any electricity wires or else it could be worse than using wireless, if you must run them close to any cables, then use shielded Ethernet cable instead of regular cables.edit : if cat6 is expensive where you live, cat5 will the job just fine.

Topic: ASICMiner controller Question..
### Original post:
I've read the stock controller on Prismas/Tubes are unreliable andyou can use a uart/usb adapter in its place.So...whats the most reliable road to take from that point???Hook it all to a usb brick and Pi???

### Reply 1:
The Tube controllers work alright for Tubes, but I've had very little luck running a Prisma off one reliably. And when I say ""work alright"" I mean there's no failover pool options and their stratum implementation is broken so it only works by default on a few pools (we've cooked up some proxies that scrub out some of the problems, but not all).The USB adapters give a lot more flexibility, as support is now built into cgminer.I've had Prismas running for a few months on USB adapters and Pis using CrazyGuy's Minera image. They're as stable as Prismas get, I reckon.If you're in need of the proper USB adapter and can't get one from AM themselves, check here: <link> like Novak's adapters better than AM's stock adapters. There's probably not much functional difference though.

### Reply 1:
Why would you want to help a competing currency, instead of your own? One of the properties of Bitcoin is that is pseudo anonymous, and with a little bit of advice from a tech person it is anonymous.Plus the IRS ruling it is illegal on several counts:1. The ruling is retroactive.2. It states you are not allowed to have a competing currency against the dollar which is contrary to the constitution.3. It challenges the FINCEN ruling, FINCEN says it is money, and the IRS says it is property, it obviously can not be both at the same time, it also challenges the state of NY, since FINCEN was first I would guess that unless the ruling of FINCEN is ruled void, then the IRS ruling has no standing. I am not a legal expert I am using common sense that you can not have contradicting laws.The Fincen ruling was also retroactive, and the victims were Mtgox, Mutum Milligium, and Dwolla, and everyone that used those services.If it is property why do people that exchange large amounts of bitcoins get money laundering charges if it is not money, why does FINCEN requires an MSB license if it is properly, will the IRS require a PSB "" Property Service Business"" license?Charlie Shrem got falsely accused <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 2:
Do you really think that paying taxes on income you get means you are supporting one currency over another? And what currency is mine? I do not make claim that I ""own"" the US Dollar nor Bitcoin as a whole. I do ""own"" some of each. I think the fact that some transactions could be considered anonymous is fine. I do not think that all transactions are anonymous. With a ""public"" ledger, and some hard work a lot of what you think could be anonymous is not anonymous at all, and if you try to keep it that way you could have a ton of work FOREVER to make sure that a transaction cannot be linked back to you. I think you could make BTC transactions totally anonymous but it would require a lot of effort. I am not doing anything that I think needs to be kept secret. Doing purchases online without the need to give up my credit card number, expiration date, and secret code on the back of my card makes BTC plenty anonymous for me. No one can use that data to take more money from me. I am not asking on my OP if you think the ruling is legal or not. There are plenty of people who think the IRS as a whole is illegal, and plenty of those people are sitting in jail because of their belief system. By t<rest of post truncated>

The goverment next step is most likely going to try to alter bitcoin so that is not anonymous, and make it inflationary, that is something that we must never allow.I would hope that the IRS would revise their ruling and make it so that bitcoin gets treated equally to the dollar, so the playing field is leveled.

### Reply 2:
Are you sending it to the same URL as the regular getwork requests?Look at the X-Long-Polling header in the responses to your regular getwork requests. They tell you where to send a long polling request, which may be a different URL.

### Reply 3:
You don't show the 'GET' line. But if it's anything other than ""GET /LP HTTP/1.1"", that's your problem.For the reason the post above me explains -- see the ""X-Long-Polling: /LP"" header in the error reply.By the way, you pasted your real Authorization. You better change the password for that worker before evil malicious bastards mine for you.

Not really sure what you mean by ""bottom end"". I believe VH has programmed the driver to take down to 6.25MHz - about 340MH. By that chart 15GH would be about the 5W point.

Having just been ripped off in another GB, I have to be a little more cautious this time so please excuse my impertinence in asking but I must: (1) Can you have someone who is well known and trusted here (maybe someone from the escrow list) verify your identify and post here. We do not need to know all the details, but having someone verify your identify, job and address and maintaining that information in escrow in case there is a scam .. well that at least makes me feel comfortable. Many other successful GB founders have done this and I now consider it a must have for myself at least.(2) Please provide details on your hosting environment. Will this be a home operation? Or do you have a commercial setup?(3) Do you have any experience with managing a hosted GB before? How do you know you will be able to do it (it is a LOT of work, especially if there are hackers on you with DDOS attacks, power issues, miners that constantly need resetting as these do (I have 10 now, and I spend 30-40 minutes a day babysitting them or else I lose hashing if I don't), etc.)(4) Your prices seem really low relative to the market.

### Original post:
Dear bitcointalk memberI want to run my antminer s9js with some proxy... which proxy do you recommend and how must do it? I want to use proxy to my ISP internet company cant find my location for using these miners.Thanksplease explain with details

### Reply 1:
I think you need to build a pfsense box to be able to use a custom proxy. pfsense box will be your another router where you can set custom firewall and proxy.Alternative if you have a good router that you can set up a proxy I suggest you buy residential IP or socks5 proxy.There is someone asking this question here on the forum look at this and maybe it will help you to set up a TCP proxy for mining <link>

### Reply 2:
I don't think ""a proxy"" is going to help you with that, perhaps you are thinking vpn or such. Hiding yourself is not easy as you might think, perhaps you can achieve something using Tor.In mining normally proxies are used for something completely different, such as consolidating all your hash rate to look like its coming from a single unit (or simply make less (but larger) connections to the pool).Besides in hostile countries miners are usually caught by electricity consumption.

### Reply 3:
I need some method that My ISP (Internet Service Provider) doesn't find my location of usage their internet ? there is n't any method ?!

### Reply 4:
I just told you to use Tor... Set up a router with tor and have your LAN use that, or a vpn or whatever you like. Your ISP can tell you are using Tor, but they can't tell what for... In countries like China they can visit you if they want to inspect your suspicious encrypted activity, so in there you have to disguise it even more.It should be possible with a couple of S9s, but not 200...

### Reply 5:
What router you are using? I found some method or a guide on how to set up a VPN on the router there are 2 ways to set them you need to choose either L2TP or PPTP. Look at these 2 sample guides below.- Set up VPN on D-Link Wi Fi router- Set up VPN on TP-Link Wi-Fi RouterThese guides are for D-link and TP-link routers connected to your internet/modem.This is alternative from what I mentioned above and this is easy to do than making a PFsense box.

### Reply 2:
Wow, that's amazing, it sounds almost too good to be true!Oh, wait. Not sure it's possible now that people have actually responded; you might talk to a moderator, though it's probably simplest if we just allow it to die peacefully until someone revives it with a necropost a year or two from now saying how it's so behind the times compared to newer technology... 14nm chipset ASICs might very well outperform our current ones by a handy amount, and at the current pace of technology it won't be too long before we're working with 8nm chips. Anyway, not really the point, we're getting into mining speculation. Glad you spotted the scam before sending them any money, and good luck finding a reliable vendor for mining ASICs who isn't constantly sold out.

There's no need for debunking when it's obvious such a miner would be instantly sold out and probably not even sold to the public if it hashed at such a speed and at such efficiency. Add on top of that the ""generic"" miner pictures and you have a solid mining scam site that's just the same as the thousands on the web.Deleting this (or moving it to Archival) would be either deleting the first post or moving it and locking it in the bottom right of the thread.

### Reply 7:
What's even better is that they offer a 130 TH/s miner for just $2000 more than the 90TH miner. All in a box just a bit larger! Or you can get a rack with five of 130 TH miners (i.e. 650 TH) for a mere $30000. Hurry, this offer is for a limited time only. Operators are standing by......I am sure they would be happy to take actual cash, or Bitcoin.

There are many here who's careers are in the semiconductor business not to mention all you have to do is a very quick search of what the current technology node - 16/14nm is capable of and what limits it. These charlatans are trying to say that they blow the doors off of current tech using 28nm which is from 2014... The performance they claim was physically impossible then and is now. Even the eventual move to 10nm and lower in the next few years would not approach what they claim.Try understanding the true technology our miners use and it is very very easy to see through their technobabble and say MASSIVE SCAM!

Topic: Length of Ethernet cable messing up blades?
### Original post:
I can't have cabled running across the middle of my living room so I got a 100ft Ethernet cable. My blades were working great all afternoon, now I get ""clean_jobs=false"" and they won't pickup any work. Anyone know what gives here??

### Reply 1:
And now using the cable I had before I'm still getting the same error. Man, everything was working perfectly for several hours, wtf.All I can think is by swapping the cable and shutting down the proxy won't let go of some jobs. Just like when I start mining it takes time for the server to ramp up my hash rate, maybe it takes time to dump jobs. I dunno, this forum has been seldom helpful unfortunately. If I have any luck I'll post back, plan right now is to just stop, shut down everything, and drink a beer- this blows.

### Reply 2:
Decided to run a crossover cable to my switch and bypass the router, now it works. Whatever the issue my router/switch was having problems with the additional cable, and then it was tripped into ""clean jobs = false"" with the shorter cable that worked earlier. Anyways, found a workaround using less cable, I'll go with it and be happy.

I think this is more of a seed for the DIY to start from. I am hopeful that we wouldn't need to be dependent on a ""chip"" to get things going.An actual open source ASIC chip would be a great starting point but there are obviously some easier pathways to get started on this. Something like the Klondike mindset and using a off the shelf chip to start with.In terms of ""membership fees"" I see it more as sweat equity. People can put in time, money and work to the development of projects for not just hardware but software etc that the whole community can use whether they are members or not. Having something that is more grassroots miner built and funded as opposed to commercial would be a great place to start. I think also that BitCoin conferences where the DIY Open Source Hardware / Software guild could interact with the community would also be great.There are some great ideas for curecoin's using our hash power for other things besides BTC. What will happen with those million dollars worth of miners when they become useless?

Apologies for noobish question.I have been using cgminer to run my 6 usb block eruptors for a few weeks now with all being great. Now that I have finally received my BFL little(which also performs perfectly well, running with bfgminer for now) my cgminer keeps reporting:Code:USB init, open device failed, err -12, you need to install a Windows USB driver for - BFL device 5:1But I already have all the drivers installed and the device is running just fine in another window.

You need to run Zadig and install WinUSB for that device.

### Reply 2:
Add""--usb BAS:0""It is covered in the readme under Advanced USB Options

### Reply 3:
Ffab thanks! I did read the readme (badly) and saw those options but it didnt stop the reporting error. I'm guessing I have to install the driver you mentioned first and then add that line. (My miner is working fine so I dont really want to start messing with drivers as I'm sure windows will mess things up for me if I did!) So will have to just ignore the error repeating. Thanks again! Myrdd.

### Reply 4:
Wise move. I'm pretty sure that if you installed the driver, you wouldn't be able to use the setup you are using since it would replace the driver you are using. Ouf of curiosity, though, why don 't you want to install the driver and use the device in cgminer (even if a separate instance) instead of running two different miners?

### Reply 5:
As my block erupters were working in cgminer I did try that first, but with no luck, probably windows fault, and bfgminer worked straight off. Now I know how to fix it, I may try cgminer again when I get a little time. Guessing it may hash a little better?Myrdd.

Topic: Consolidated BFL Board Development Thread
### Original post:
I'm starting this thread as a place where people can check in and collaborate on the development of a board (or boards) that can use the BFL ASIC chips. This is not a group buy or a lets-bash-BFL thread. Once a board design is established, cooling issues and case design can be discussed later.Note: I'm only starting this thread to organize all efforts into one place. I myself can't really design anything. I'm not an EE, and I don't know what I'm doing. I will help out where I can, tho.Ok here's the information we have available:BFL's Order Page. That page also has some basic specs:Those reference documents mentioned have already been released. The Jalapeno's board schematics and PCB can be found HERE. The SC Firmware Source Code was release HERE. If you have any issues downloading those files, I can send them to ya by some other means.I see we've got a few people already working on designs, but if you guys want to coordinate here, that would be great!

### Reply 1:
I want to just post my initial ideas and tired ramblings. This really doesn't have any bearing on the rest of this discussion.The BFL chips are a lot more dense than Avalon or ASICMiner chips, for both power and heat, cramming 4GH/s into a 7.5x7.5mm die. A board like the original Avalon or K64 where the chips are all spread out and share one giant heatsink prolly wont work very well. I mean we could put a little VGA heatsink with a tiny fan on each individual chip, but that gets expensive fast. A giant heatsink like the original Avalon won't work, because unlike the Avalon, if one chip isn't making good contact with the heatsink, it will overheat. For power, those K16s use an estimated 32W for 16 chips, while a Jalapeno uses that much for 2 chips. If we wanted a full 16 chip board, we're looking at ~250Watts. Now BFL dealt with the heat limitations by grouping all the chips up in the center, and using one heatsink (with a large enough base) to cover each group of 6/8 chips, and cool them all at once. They're using a thermal pad instead of thermal paste to account for the potential for a height difference, although it is such a small area it can't be that much of a difference betwee<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 2:
If each chip does 4ghs. Why does my jalapeno use 2 for 5ghs?

### Reply 3:
Using GPU setups is a good idea a very useful to GPU miners.On the other hand there will be some limitations.After finishing the Avalon miner design and production (K16,K1, Tbxx) We are going to get into the design of BFL chip based miner.For the moment I ordered 100 chips my self, other 100 ordered in a group buy with me , next group buy is 1/2 full already.I'll be watching this thread

### Reply 4:
simple POWER and HEAT issues ....May be using lower gradesAlso You are not able to make 5 GH/s with 4 GH/s chip

### Reply 5:
If you had paid more 100 US$, for the proposed BFL upgrade, it would be giving you 7 GH/s instead 5 GH/s, with the same 2 ASIC ships...

### Reply 6:
Basically its firmware and a frequency setting. Yours has setting 1 (189mhz) while the chips have a minimum possible mhz of 250 (which is around setting 5). Higher grade chips can clock even higher.These topics are about the firmware and these freq settings:<link>

### Reply 7:
Because some of the chips may not have all their engines working, and are obviously still good enough to make up 5GH/s but might not make 7GH/s.

### Reply 8:
The first minirig 500Ghs has a consumption of 2400w.If its 65nm chips have a 3.2w/ghs consumption. The minirig would have a theoretical consumption of 1600w. This is 50% more

### Reply 9:
The chip itself consumes 3.2W/GHs. The board will be higher than that, and that doesn't include the power costs of running a shit ton of large fans, and then the PSU inefficiencies.Each chip is 4GH/s @ 3.2W/GHs for ~12.8W per chip. Each board has 16 chips, which is 205W just for the chips. Then you add in the voltage regulators (assume 90% inefficient) that's 205W X 1.1 = 225W. Add 2 fans per board (another 10W), power for the board controller and all other various components, and you're looking at 250W per board.Each MR has 8 boards, so that brings the total to 2000W. Then you add in the 18 case fans (9 on each side). Lets assume a typical case 12V case fan, so you're talking 10W per fan, or another 180W total. That's 2180Watts.Then your PSUs are inefficient as well. Even if they're 80PlusGold, they're 90% efficient at max load, which adds another 10% of your total power. 2180W X 1.1 = 2398Watts, almost exactly the 2400W prediction. If you're using 220V for your PSUs, they'll be ~92% efficient at max load, which brings your draw down to 2180W X 1.08 = 2355W, which is again almost exactly what was predicted if you run them off 220V. Hope this answers your question.

Everything looked sweet and ready to go, but then when I fired it up the only card that was recognized while on a riser was the one in the PCIE4 slot. I tried the following to no avail:1) Tried switching the risers out to see if the cards would pick up in the other slots with the confirmed working riser2) Tried removing the risers, getting the cards to be recognized in Windows 7, then rising them3) Tried swapping the cards around to ensure that all cards could be recognized in PCIE4 with a riser - they could but no other spot recognizes any card with the risersAfter that, I decided to just try and get all 4 of the cards mining to see how it goes, so I put a card in PCIE1, PCIE5, and PCIE6 and used the riser in PCIE4.

This is actually a good deal. I would consider buying 1 of those chips but my only concern is getting the chips out of that board. Can I trust someone to do the reflow work while keeping the chip at 100% perfect condition, and then get it into my design without damaging it at all. The other issue is if I do have a problem with the chip I receive I won't know if its my design, if its my board, or if its the chip ect. This x factor makes me want to wait to receive test chips from Avalon instead.1.4BTC almost makes me want to try anyways but Im not sure if we can get the othe 9 chips sold. I don't think we could arrange all this disassembly and shipping before the Avalon test chips ship anyways.If your not willing to pay 15x the going rate for pre orders don't expect to buy any chips untill we have them all in hand. Test chips are not really for sale either, nor should they be. They are very limited and reserved for developers and assemblers. They would sell for at least 1.4BTC each if you could find somebody willing to sell one. Once we get them.

Download the client. Run the client. Let it download the block chain. Issue it a ""getwork"" RPC request. You now need to do a double SHA-256 using every possible 32-bit nonce, all 2^32 of them. Should you find a nonce that produces a hash less than the target, report that back to the client using a ""getwork"" RPC as soon as possible.See this thread: <link>

+1 I think they won't be able to ship anything in Oct. Given the fact that there is no evidence of a running prototype exist now. One month to bring a limping prototype to fully functional product is pretty impressive, if they can do it. So I won't be surprised if they start shipping in Nov. You fan boys have been claiming ""as soon as the chips arrive, slam the chip on the PCB and done, no prototype, no testing needed"". I don't think such thing happens in the real world.

hi!I have a brand new Antminer S7 batch 11 and and Antminer S5.I really dont like that S7 working too hot and really really loud, in addition 1200 W is too much power consuption from one location becuase of several reasons for me. Idea 1:The fact is that i would like to split S7 performance into 2 custom devices. Of course i can remove hashing boards from S7. By this way i can reduce power consuption to 800W ( 2 boards) or 400 W(1 board). This is okay.My idea is to plug removed hasing board into S5 controller. Becuase as i see S7 uses S5(+) controller.The result would be an S7 with 2 hasing board, with less heat, less cables, less consuption, and of course less speed, BUT it would def has a longer lifetime or/and better OC.And a modded S5 with nice temps, 1,6 Th on about 380W. + I can use them in different locationsIdea2:It is really crappy that hashing boards in S7 has small heatsinks and dont use the housing which is a full aluminium, very good for a heatsink. Plus boards are very close to each other wich make less effective heating at all.Would be great to utilize housing as a heatinks or to completly remove all hasingboards and put there huge heatsinks on each blade and forget <rest of post truncated>

Idea 2 is no good heat sinks are really hard to remove.Idea 1 may work not sure

### Original post:
Hey Guys,I'm getting to the point where I am about ready to flip the big switch outside and start bringing miners online and just wanted to get another set of eyes just to make sure I'm not doing anything terribly egregious in regards to how things are set up.I have two sperate service runs in the space I am in. They are both 3/0 runs to separate 225 Amp panels. One panel has lights and fixtures on it for the space so I will be leaving it alone. The other is bare (no breakers or circuits) so I will be using that one to stand up the first pod.Panel Notes:Stinger Hi-Leg configuration A - Single Phase 120vB - Three phase 208vC - Single Phase 120vI'm using 30 Amp tree-pole breakers and only running off of the 120v lugsSince this is a service panel the Ground and Neutral are bonded.25ft EMT run to L6-30 receptacles using 10 AWG wireEach receptacle will connect to a 30A 208/240v PDUMiners connect to PDU which has 8 Amp fuses on outletsTwo shorter runs to power two 120v receptacles for other devices, each on a separate 1 pole breakerAirflow looks like so:Air > Filter > Enclosure > Blower Fan > S9 Bank > Exhaust into empty space > Extracted <truncated> look terribly out of place?

I figured I would provide an update for those that are curious if I died in a fire or not in this past week.Miners are running well and within derated ampacity limits of the wire gauge that was used. I've been bringing them up in groups and taking readings everywhere to make sure its all going to plan. These things are super loud, next project is some sort of enclosure to provide some soundproofing and path to extract the hot air.

true but reality fiat is usually scarce for most of us, especially if we invested a lot <truncated> along time 3ths will be the 1th ,and preorders are so last year, but you could let spondooly off because they do deliver.

### Reply 8:
Not worth the risk for razor thin margins.

### Reply 9:
Well people showed interest about this kind of product:

### Reply 10:
The product itself looks very good. It's the three month pre-order at only half the cost of currently available hardware that is not so good, but to each their own. If the price of BTC is much higher in September than it is now, this could still work out OK for buyers in fiat terms. I can't really blame spondoolies-tech for trying to presell as much hardware as they possibly can because it offloads their risk onto buyers.

### Reply 11:
Agreed. Very high level calculations show that this unit costs about half as much per GH as currently available mining hardware, uses half as much electricity, but won't be delivered for 3+ months.If difficulty goes up more than 2x over the next 3 months, which is VERY likely, this is not a very good buy. Money would be much better spent deploying hardware now at twice the cost per GH and mining with it for the next 3 months.

### Reply 12:
when would i need to pay the $2800?

### Reply 13:
After there are 400 units reserved. If reservation isn't met I will return you the reservation fee.They are not offloading the risk onto buyers because there is not risk. They are trying to secure a supply chain and the advantages are numerous for doing that.

### Reply 14:
Lol that is a bit disingenuous Road , saying there is no risk. And this is coming from someone who ordered sp30s for Aug deilvery. There is a ton of risk the main one being that the price of BTC falls off a cliff along with high diff which makes these machines nothing but expensive paperweights.I could name more but you get my drift. Yes its a lesser Risk than Pr-ordering from BA or KNC but there is ALWAYS a risk to the per-orderer.

### Reply 15:
He's talking about market risk. The company itself is probably the most solid in the industry.Mining companies would have you believe that the only reasons they build and sell equipment rather than build and mine equipment are altruistic: For the good of the network, bitcoin in general, etc. Reality is that, just like in every industry, they are doing it for a managed risk/profit margin to people who have slightly different needs or desires. By doing presales, they guarantee their revenue even if the market becomes saturated with equipment, which it just might.Any rate, we're way off topic now and in the OP you wanted this thread to stay on topic and ignore profitability debates. I'm really interested in getting one of these myself, but I need to make sure I have the coin first. Unfortunately the interest in this isn't what I expected it would be when I first saw this. I'm hoping we can make the 400 to even make this a possibility.

### Reply 16:
Whilst I appreciate your efforts and I've been in both the previous group buys....I'd much rather have a deal on the SP10's that are in stock, the price hasn't moved for a while and difficulty has gone up, as much as I love mine I can't pull the trigger on any more at current price.

### Reply 17:
thanks for the lightning quick responsejust some clarification if you dont mindso if by june 5 you collect 400 reservations i would get <truncated> for the full paymentis that immediately, what is the deadline for the actual payment?what if you collect 400 reservations but some people dont pay, is the group buy still valid?what if you collect 400 reservations but they decide to not make the sp15, i guess thats a possibility too?

### Reply 18:
Of course I was talking about the non-delivery/being late risk. The difficulty and the exchange rate isn't in SP-Tech's hands.Don't you think that this is good for further and better development?If by 5 June there are at least 400 reservations you would be required to pay immediately. I think that a decent 2-3 days are allowed extra for any type of payment that you wish to use.If there are 400 reservations but some people won't pay there will be a decision right then depending on various factors. Can't say anything for sure, but I can say that I will try to make it decent.(like I won't cancel the GB for missing 3-4 units or stuff like that)If there are 400 units paid there will be a SP15 for sure. Maybe it will be available for some future batches, but if the requirement won't be met <rest of thread truncated>

A few hundred dollar video card will give you that kind of hash rate, obviously it will chew a lot more power but still. FPGA chips seem overpriced, probably not enough competition.

you can order a dev kit, but they cost some money

### Reply 22:
Well, depends on how skilled your engineer is. Please compare the range of the bitstreams for teh spartan6 which spans 200 MHash/s to ?300? MHash/s.

### Reply 23:
For those who are developing anything at all, they have better chances learning how to develop FPGA dev boards if they don't have a few years of Engineering or tinkering under their belt. While those Avalon chips are a steal, and I might buy a few soon, I'd like to get documentation about them, and what their requirements are before I go and build an ASIC rig for myself.Not too many people have a deep understanding of the Avalon chips, so for most people it's not a good idea to buy them up before they know what to do with them.I would assume between 150-300MH/s per chip. The hashrate depends on a number of things. Firstly it depends on the clock rate you set the FPGA at, and secondly it depends on the bitstream you program into the FPGA.Do you have experience with FPGA's at all?

### Reply 24:
at the end of the day is always how many hash rate per chip and at what price is the chip that counts...

### Reply 25:
I'm still alone, I only have an idea, no team, no engineer....

### Reply 26:
150-300MH/s only?? I'm not talking about Spartan-6....

### Reply 27:
Yeah for some reason I was thinking Spartan 6, was half asleep.As far as the Virtex-7 goes, and the bandwith that chip is capable of it can produce roughly ~1GH/s to maybe 3GH/s. It's a very beefy chip, and also very expensive. I'm talking $4000 a chip.The Stratix 5 I'm not quite sure. I don't see any numbers as far as chip bandwidth goes, but it's outrageously expensive per chip as well. So I don't know how low of a price you're trying to negotiate, or where from. I'm curious as to why you would consider the investment if you aren't an Engineer or don't have one?

### Reply 28:
I'm not an engineer and I don't have any. No problem, we are human and we have to make mistakes. Yeah Virtex-7 is a good one. And Kintex-7? It could be possible the 7K410T series could make about 750mhash/s?Thanks again.

Why do you want to install it on Windows 10? I think you don't need to install it you just need to download and configure the bat file and then run it.If you are planning to mine with CPU it won't work.Kano has a guide on how to run this if you have USB miner or erupter then follow this guide below- <link>

### Reply 2:
One possible 'gotcha' is that Windows requires using the Zadig USB driver.It also needs to be mentioned that -ck's version of cgminer is rather old as -ck stopped supporting it long ago. Unless you have a specific reason for using that old version (eg cpu/gpu mining) it is highly suggested that you use Kano's much updated version which is currently at r4.12.1which can be found here

Order your self black arrow 2th late February delivery miner.There is no other mining hardware worth of buying right now.And there is no need to create any large or smal ""network"" () for mining.

### Reply 4:
Thanks for the quick replies guys. I just hope when I get all components and get eveything set up I can still make a profit, instead of paying too much to the electricity company. Of course I could use it to mine other cryptocoins

### Reply 5:
Just do good research on what hashing speed you will get and how much power it will cost you. An easy tool to see which coins are most profitable and at what cost, take a look at <link>

computer with 2 or more amd radeon 7950s for scrypt mining:) if u buy asics then y have a larger risk of not getting ur investment back and not being able to sell ur miner for a good price. where as u could sell ur gpus for nearly the same price as u bought them

### Reply 7:
None don't do it. Just buy and hold.

### Reply 8:
I agree with the others, scrypt mining with amd gpu's is a good bet, but getting some pre-order equipment from black arrow seems like a good bet as you can always sell the hardware on ebay for more than what you paid for most likely.

### Reply 9:
for alt coins this is probably going to be your entry key. Easy to expand and has a resale value should you want to sell up quickly.If you are looking at bitcoin or other SHA256 stuff, ASICs are the way forward, with all their ongoing problems with useful life and supply dates.

### Reply 10:
Stick just to scrypt coins, dont even look at btc and asics unless u want to spend some real big money. Under 600 can make an ok rig which on the right pools can return in less than a couple of months at the current markets.I'm liking some of the new MBs with 6 PCI slots, best to run Linux to avoid the whole 4-5 GPU only bugs stuff. U can always start with 1 card and work up.

As the profit rolls in, invest those profits in new hardware - motherboards, GPUs, RAM, processors and drives, to get greater return or just to combat the rising <truncated> to new (and lower difficulty) coins can mitigate the difficulty rise.

Oh the voice of reason, that's the most profitable advice, but where is the fun and learning while playing with hardware?

### Reply 13:
If everybody held their coins then BTC would no longer be used as a currency and would become worthless except for nostalgia hoarders.Build a dogecoin rig or something of that nonsense. BTC ASICs will usually not repay their BTC investment although they might break even on fiat basis.

### Reply 14:
Agreed, people need to trade and use any of the BTC\Altcoins for them to have value. Just hoarding coins will never increase the price because what reason do people have to buy them otherwise.

madjules007 do you know if coinwarz is telling you the profitability based on mining on your own or joining a pool?

### Reply 16:
It's based on Solo mining I believe.

### Reply 17:
are you crazy?when you solo mine only thing you can mine is whole block! so calculation would be ""time to mine block...""!!so it's obviously pool mining calculation showed on <link>

### Reply 18:
Unless you have alot of hashpower behind you dont solo mine, join a pool it will give u a better chance of completing a block.

### Reply 19:
that's a complete different thing!mining calculators, thegenesisblock, coinwarz etc. are giving you pool mining profitability calculation!

Thanks for the information Guys, In this price Mining is really Profitable.I want to start a new mining rig with investment of 3K so anyone could recomend me specially PleaseThankyou

### Reply 21:
With $3000, you can create a rig with 3 R9 280x GPUs. Check out this guide: <link> rig should get you around 2.1 MHashes/s

Thanks for fast and best replyI will try to assemble accordinglyas your best information howmany time could it take for ROI Ie. Todays price of Bitcoin is 700$

### Reply 23:
You should not use this rig to mine BTC directly. That would take a long time (decades, I think), with the rising difficulty.You should be mining scrypt based coins like LTC or others.Take a look at any of the following links. Enter 2100 kHashes/sec in the scrypt textboxes, and they will give you an upper estimate of your earnings.<link> value of these alt coins can be very volatile, so you may want to get familiar with these tables, and switching between coins when it increases your profitability. If you don't want to handle that manually, you can look into an auto-switching pool <rest of thread truncated>

Topic: Board Designs for BlackArrow's Minion Chips
### Original post:
Due to BlackArrow delays, some of their customers are being offered 50 Minions in place of a miner.Just wondering if anyone had done anything with these chips. There could be a lot available soon.WASP Collective was going to design something but I don't know if it <truncated> customers are wondering if it's worth it to get the chips or continue to wait. Thoughts?

HI,we are working on our board.The test board is already populated with 1 chip and we are testing.I'll update as soon we have results

### Reply 2:
Any guesses on performance yet Marto?

### Reply 3:
We are not working on the Minion chips at this time. We are working with the Hammer SpondooliesTech trying to develop a board that goes into a DataTank test system at Allied Control hopefully in June when I am in HK for the Inside Bitcoin conference. Our Minion design board will only be starting later in 2014.Best suggestion don't take the chips unless you have something already tested and working and fabricator you can trust. Such a small number of chips will be a fairly expensive build. You might be waiting a lot longer than just being patient for them to figure out their issues with the backplane. Or take the miner compensation and mine or sell them.

### Reply 4:
Weren't you guys working on a universal system for all chips? Didn't the WPC receive a variety of chips from a variety of manufacturers? What happened to all of those and the cards WPC was working on to support them? Are you going to follow through on the Hammer ASIC, or are you guys going to scrap that entirely as soon as another one comes along like you have for everything else?

### Reply 5:
I have 20 of the chips in hand sealed in the US, any one who is interested in DIY board design is more than welcome to contact me to receive them.

### Reply 6:
A 3rd party board for these chips would be very cool.

### Reply 7:
We are not working on the re-design yet for the Minion. We had nearly finished an A1 board and had it blinking away and that has now been relegated to a test board, (as the blinking board was designed as a test board anyhow as a first prototype), and we did this because more chips became available and we were offered the Hammer chips and took that tact over the A1, BE200 and the Minion we look at the costs of the chips and the design requirements and made our decision based on the recommendations of the EE team. The WPC in meetings then set out a plan for moving on to other chips as the A1 is an odd ball chip to say the least with its unique cooling issues.So, first we have to get our 1300 Hammer chips into a preliminary design either some as a Whiteface that will be Novec cooled or a Hornet which is an air cooled board. We could work with others if they want to take on parallel design for the Minion versions but we would have to look at some sort of agreement for that and the members who have invested in the boards (project) would have to agree. That is something that lead EE can talk more about. If anyone is keen on that please contact me and I will arrange for you to come to the<rest of post truncated>

My guess is that won't be necessary as BA is paying for or looking for a solution given what I read. Wish we had the resources to do 3 chips at the same time but we are not Spondoolies.

You are wrong, very wrong on all aspects about the WPC, and that board which is an A1 Wasp prototype and has nothing to do with Zefir or Bitmine.

Topic: Does SMOS works with the Gridseeds ???
### Original post:
Hi,I just would like to know if SMOS works for Gridseeds ??Thanks in advance

### Reply 1:
I'm interested as well. SMOS is based on BAMT, and defaults to mining with CGMiner.I've searched for Gridseed with BAMT and found nothing. But Gridseed does work with CGMiner. More reading says a modified version of CGMiner is preferred (required?), which allows possible software overclocking (unverified) to some degree, and improved hash statistics. Ideally, I would prefer a version of SMOS which would optionally handle both Gpu and Scrypt capable ASIC's together, to take advantage of all hardware available. AND, would also be CPU mining enabled as a user option (the m/b's already running, why not pull another 100k if it's there? ).

### Reply 2:
Hi,hope it's not too late...Short answer: Yes (I'm dual mining single GS on a 7950 SMOS rig)Long answer - later, if my answer is still useful.The real problem is here: When I'll solve this problem too, I promise to write something about it... until then, google like me and test everything!

### Reply 3:
Oh please do. Windows has been a complete failure with Gridseeds. no problem mining the GPu, but want use a USB linux distro to control Gridseeds on a separate box to my windows box, but am a total linux and ASIC Noob. I just dont know where to start or what to do. I just dont even know if SMOS or BAMT will be useful to me. On this linux box I will be mining the Seeds only, that box has a nVidia card and I wont even bother getting any Hash's from that. I think at best it was only ever good for 80kh/s So any and all help I could receive to get up and running with a linux Distro on USB to control Gridseed 5 chip Dual miners (scrypt only) would be greatly and muchly appreciated because like the other guys above I have googled and googled and found next to nothing that is specific to my needs.Thanks a Tonne in Advance

### Reply 4:
@Supercell:Hi, I don't have good news: it works as I wrote before, BUT:- SMOS never replied >> so I deactivated their donation scheme- Once at 2~4 days it stops (and if I sleep or I'm gone, I've lost more than 15min/24h)- I triple-mine on that rig (GPU, and dual GS), and I've tested BAMT with GPU+ASIC+CPUFrom what I've seen, SMOS is newer than BAMT (miner-wise and drivers), and other donation mechanism (a little harder)So, they took BAMT, updated it (me too...), a little obfuscation in donation scripts, and nicer reporting (??)Methodology: (I can't tell You which keys to push!...)- any Linux GS guide (I also used RPi's)- Compile and Install ALL they ask - including GS-enabled cgminer and cpuminer(that's why You HAVE to know what are You doing...) - start them in two screens - sha first, scrypt later...- Break Your coffee cup when Donation kicks in!...Hope You'll manage it, I'll check this thread later...

I guess making multiple orders the first day and paying extra on shipping has paid off.Received BFL single today and took some screen shots to share.I'll admit that I did receive an email when it shipped from BFL asking me to share PICs and I agreed.This has made my day. Good luck to all those still waiting. I'm still waiting for many other BFL Miners I haveordered for friends, family, and myself.Forgot to mention: I had lent my kill-o-watt meter to a friend so I will have to get back on that one.Powered with two PCI-e power connectors (same as the GPUs)Stop at Fry's on the way home to get a good power supply.Here's the miner setup and working away. approximately 50+ GHs (average looks around 54, butneed to let it run longer to know for sure)

What's with the 1 week delay? Are you going to be mining with it during that time?

simple test.....Open it up and check for dust/signs of heat marking.If there are none, then I would suspect the bubble wrap, we have a similar problem in the China factories, we find the Bubble wrap is sometimes CRAP and will actually damage a products painted surface due to impurities in the BB wrap.....Also certain types of poly bag has the same effect...., it depends on the paints chemistry.The other thing is that if you ordered early it should be a 60GH/s unit.........

I see your point; just don't buy. screwing over a buyer vs. leaving ebay for being inflexible on their TOS that I don't even know what it says is not the same in my view. But to each his own. I've been on the edge of never selling on ebay again and I have a perfect rating. If they [ebay] give me problems, it won't be a problem for the buyer. I'll just move over to bitmit where i also have a good rating.Like I said in the listing, if you don't like how it is then just don't bid. Pretty simple really.

If BFL is shipping that is an insane price. i hope nobody is dumb enough to buy unless they are ok with a 1 year ROI and thats only IF they are lucky enough for the network hash rate to stay low or the price of bitcoins to shoot up again. Lucky for you, there is a idiot born every minute.Dont get me wrong. Its a bit of a knee jerk reaction and people can buy what they want, i just question their thought process.

### Reply 1:
With the current price of bitcoin there isn't going to be ANY miner that will show a good ROI prediction ~ you're probably better off just buying bitcoin. A few hundred dollars higher and it's a different ball game. It's not the first time the mining forecast was all doom and gloom, but somehow most of the miners have managed to stay in the game. Last time around it was the move from ~$100 average price up to ~1000 that saved the day for miners; how it will play out from here is anyones guess. I can tell you that even 10% sustained growth at this point without an increase in BTC/USD rate will be toxic for most miners.There can be some interesting tax advantages to mining at a small loss, particularly if you have other gains to offset. You can write off the mining losses, but still acquire bitcoin for future appreciation. The mining hardware really can't even be considered a capital investment as it becomes so quickly obsolete. It's cost is more akin to a drill bit for an oil rig, a straight expense. There are similar tax strategies using oil/gas ventures.Also you never know what exclusive offers we will find for our owners only group buys.

FYI to anyone looking to invest, he puts the stats on his website and weekly updates. I commend him for posting them. Especially with how honest and bad they are. <link> me crazy but are your customers losing money? What was the buy in and monthy cost for #2? Whats the ROI on your first 2-3 rigs so far? For group buy #2 is the math 3.6 bitcoins this week divided by 290 shares meaning each share produced .0124 bitcoin this week? Whats the monthly share cost? $24 a month profit is pretty painful.Looks like ""amount per share"" stat thats on #4 is .006 average for the last 4 weeks on rig #4. Is that their total profit at the end of the week?

### Reply 4:
Group one has paid out 68% of the initial investment, and the other early groups are in the 50-60% range. Mind you this is without the Neptunes, which should arrive sometime in the next month or so. The amount per share is after all hosting fees have been subtracted; our operation is fully transparent and open. Those that pay for hosting in USD get the full amount of bitcoin that their share mined, with no deductions. Oh and we actually mine, unlike some of the scam-mining operations that are merely a ponzi. We can prove our mining activity on the blockchain, and are one of the top teams on BTC guild. Our monthly fees are competitive with other companies that offer data-center hosting for miners; and we have been pushing those costs down over time. This group buy is down to $199/mo to host 1000W miner in a top-tier datacenter. Start calling around and shop datacenter space and you'll quickly realize that its a *deal*.

I've been trying to get a block erupter blade to run for over 48 hours now.After I finally figured out all the configuration details and downloaded all the needed software and set it up to run on a pool, it just runs for 2 min. and 20 sec. and then resets itself.I've tried all of the fixes i could find here on the forum and nothing has worked.can anybody help me?

### Reply 1:
Are you able to try it on a different computer? It could be some conflict with that machine, and if you can run them on another computer without issue, its probably the computer. If the same thing happens on another computer, its probably the erupters.

### Reply 2:
I'm not sure why but my other computer wont run the stratum proxy. maybe i'll try my laptop.After fumbling with the blade for several hours without finding a solution, I opened a brand new one out of the box and configured it from scratch... same problem, resets itself after 2 min. 20 sec. exactly.I'm going to try another PC... Anyone else having the same problem?

Still no luck... I ran bfgminer on the other computer and pointed it to slush's pool... same problem... 2 min. resetEven if the data cable is not plugged in... 2 min. resetim running out of ideas...Am i the only one who is having this problem?

### Reply 4:
You set the server addresses and ports to the IP your stratum proxy is running on?You made sure the stratum proxy computer and the blade are in the same subnet?You made sure the blade's Gateway is the gateway for that subnet also?It resets every 2:20 when it isn't able to connect to something getwork.

### Reply 5:
Thanks for the reply!Yes, the server addresses all match the IP address of the PC that is running the stratum proxy.All are on the same subnet which is ""0"" and the gateway matches as well.I was actually mining on slush's pool for a while before the first reset, only at 9% inefficiency tho. Is there a way i can run the blade without using the proxy just to see if it works?Are there any pools i can test this with?i really hope i didnt buy defective blades!

### Reply 6:
If you have a pool that still has active getwork nodes, just punch that in as the server address. Low efficiency or low hashrate is expected here, because of the delays from getwork. When you say mining on slush's pool before the first reset, was that via stratum proxy or directly connected to the pool's getwork server?Did you hit ""switch server"" during the reset? I did a test on one of mine earlier, and changed the server address to an unused IP on my network. The blade reset every 2:20 as expected, but even after changing the server IP back to proper it still was resetting until I hit ""Switch Server"" which I guess woke it up and got it spooling properly.

I was on slush's pool via stratum proxy, only running at like 9% efficiency and then reset at 2 min 20 sec it resets. I will try hitting switch server.Thanks.

### Reply 8:
The only times I've had low efficiency were from getwork via internet (no stratum proxy) and from extreme overheating of the chips. Never saw 9% though. Was it low because of few accepted shares, or because of insanely high received? I know when the ASICs get overheated they tend to spam the getwork; accepted shares per minute might be acceptable but received work goes through the roof so efficiency drops.

### Reply 9:
As folks have said, the 2 minute 20 seconds is the automatic watchguard. If the Blade isn't getting work, then it resets.Try Eligius or BitMinter, both still have a getwork server running. I have Eligius' getwork interface set as the backup pool on my Blades, with the primary server the getwork proxy on BFGMiner that's running on MinePeon on the RPi.

Hi.im having the same problem, arround 2 minutes the blade restart... and its not posible change config, because wen change some... the config was not saved...any idea?

### Reply 11:
Did you ""Update/Restart"" after altering the config settings? If it still doesn't take after doing that, it could be bad memory in the firmware controller on the blade - which isn't really fixable.

### Reply 12:
in my case the config is:mac pro (192.168.1.5)cable modem with 4 ports hub (i think is hub, not swich)the steps that i did:1.- factory reset (pin 2 and 3 )3.- plug in one port at hub cable-modem4.- try go to <truncated> Fail...after i decided to plug directly to my mac (mac <----- ethernet cable ----> Blade) and i could go to config web at blade... but... 2 minutes and some seconds... the blade make a reset...i have no idea, maybe the blade dont find any pool at default ips and just restart... or maybe im doing some bad.Thanks in advance, and sorry for my bad english.

Can anyone estimate how many btc 500 gh/s comes out to be? is it dependent on the pool we join? is solo possible? how many people are in a pool like this? are the 25 btc found split evenly per share? umm ok thats is enough random questions for this page

Flexgroo,It'll depend more on when the miner is received. A good way to calculate how much you can get per Ghs is this site.<link> it depends on difficulty. And difficulty goes up about 20% every 2 weeks on average.Hope that helps.

Interesting...I'd be curious to see the 5870 on there as well, since it's one of the more highly sought-after cards out there.

### Reply 1:
Why is the 5850 on there twice? I'm curious to see where the 5970 would place.

### Reply 2:
Nice. Add in 5870 and 5970 I would imagine they will be outliers (I wish they weren't ).

### Reply 3:
The 5770 is there twice too. It's comparing the value of ~200 days after release and ~800 days after release. At least that's what I think.

### Reply 4:
Yep - there are actually 2-3 points for each card. There's the launch price, which appears at [0,100%] for all cards, then I generally found a mid-point price from a forum or archived news story, then a 3rd data point generally came from eBay, as beyond a certain date, it's harder to get hold of new stock. (and even when you can they're at unrealistically high prices)

### Reply 5:
[EDIT: Should mention this work was done in not $$$ (or BTC )]I've started doing a bit of small-time mining recently (~1.5GH/s) and I wanted to do some estimation of real profits, taking into account the capital cost of the mining hardware. After a bit of trawling, was amazed that I couldn't find a simple graph of GPU depreciation, so I made one. I'm not claiming this is comprehensive - I only looked at prices for mid-range ATI GPUs, because I thought the very high-end cards might follow a different price curve, and the very low-end cards are just hard to find prices for.I basically looked for a few different cost points in the life cycle for the ATI 3000-6000 series - e.g. (i) the launch price, (ii) a subsequent price drop announcement, and then (iii) a used-price on eBay. The 'cost half-life' is about 550 days, or 18 months.

### Reply 6:
Well, you don't get much MHash out of a 5770, but I've found it's a pretty awesome combination of MH/J and MH/ - I picked up 2 for 50 each, and I'm running them at 1V@860,300 for a power draw of 78W and rate of 197MH/s. That's 2.53 MH/J and 4 MH/.

### Reply 7:
14 posts and you come post something THIS useful? You get my ""Newcomer of the month"" award. It's an interesting topic to research. I suppose there could also be a correlation between the drop in value and the release of a new generation of cards. Do you have any dates?*EDIT*Ok, I didn't saw your excel chart. The data is limited but hey, it's still a good start.

### Reply 8:
Thanks! - I've been lurking for a few weeks, but glad to post something people might find useful. I'm really only mining to support the network, and because I believe bitcoin is a fundamentally good thing; UK electricity prices really only allow a very slim profit margin for miners (we're talking 10% here). I know I didn't collect a whole lot of data, but I don't have the time to do something more all-encompassing (I'm supposed to be working right now actually ). I think most people already know that products in the sort of bracket that GPUs inhabit (novel technology) follow an exponential curve with their depreciation - I just wanted to get a rough idea of the time constant.

### Reply 9:
HD3850 does not support GPU mining..

### Reply 10:
Maybe not, but it is a good reference point on the graph. It supports double precision and up until recently would have been usable at Milkyway@home. I haven't owned any HD38xx cards, but had a 2600 for a while (until it died). The 5970 points would be very interesting, and even the 4890x2'sOP: thanks for the graph

### Reply 11:
True, but it does have a GPU, and it does depreciate, so it's valid to put it on the graph Name me a card released 1500 days ago that does support GPU mining...

Topic: X6500 with Raspberry Pi?
### Original post:
Hello, I've just decided to purchase a Dual FPGA X6500 and i'm considering a few options for the rig that I'll be runing with it. A full fledged pc, even with an os on a stick seems like overkill especially since I've heard about the raspberry Pi, but I've no idea if the on board OS of the raspberry(ARM Debian) will support a miner. I'm pretty new at the whole linux thing, like the idea but don't quite know my way around. If anyone can shed a bit of light it would be awesome.thanks

### Reply 1:
Here is some info.<link>

### Reply 2:
It works but the raspberry pi is a little ""miss princess"" when it comes to USB Connections.... (usb Hubs and so forth). I couldn't get it working with my Ztex boards. Not for a long therm mining operation.

### Reply 3:
thanks guys, i'll get reading and investigating

### Reply 4:
It should work <truncated> all work fine on my RaspberryPi with my Cairnsmore1 boards, so your x6500 boards should work fine after you get everything set up ( there's some guides on the forums depending on what mining software you want to use )

### Reply 5:
Take care that you have a good power supply for the PI and a good (maybe powered) USB HUB. What helps is to tape the power contacts of the USB Port that connects the hub to the pi (It hates feedback power .... from a not so good usb cables or HUBs).

### Reply 6:
I was considering one of these: <link> expensive, but there are more USB root hubs. Better for the multi device miner.Also, bear in mind that the Raspberry Pi doesn't have an Ubuntu build right now, I believe there is a Fedora offering though. Nothing against Fedora, I quite like it, but do remember that you'll need to install more libraries and suchlike to get up and running using Bitcoin-d with Fedora (with the inevitable teeth gnashing and howling at the moon when you struggle to get it to work, I've been there!)

### Reply 7:
Why not just use debian? :S

### Reply 8:
I've talk to a few people who have used Debain and had USB problems using FPGAs, has since swapped to Ubuntu and saw the issues disappear.

### Reply 9:
Indeed. I've no doubt it's possible to use Fedora or Debian for mining, but the USB drivers for Fedora looked like a whole heap of ball-ache when I investigated using it for my x6500 (and I actually wanted to use it in preference to Ubuntu, it seems a bit more grown-up somehow). Not to mention the package installation system is different (.rpm), so I couldn't easily install various other apps either.I would have thought that Debian should be easier to set up mining with than Fedora, purely because Ubuntu is based on it (it also uses .deb and .apt packaging systems, and I shouldn't wonder that the USB drivers are either the same or can be easily installed)I can hear eyes rolling in Linux afficionados heads; it's true, I've only really being using it regularly for less than 18 months. And damn, I'm surprised that you <truncated> don't inisist on recompiling the entire OS (and apps) every time before you start working each day... everything needs doing yourself it seems! I am getting to like it though, considering ditching Mammonsoft altogether

Topic: Wind Turbine and power supply?
### Original post:
Quick question, could a single 400 watt wind turbine and 2 batterys and a 6000w inverter power 3 s9 ant miners at 1350 watts per miner. Im not too in-depth with electricity but trying my best to learn.

### Reply 1:
If the turbine is only 400W how does that suddenly become 1400W X3?I think you would need 4 of these turbines per miner, but the inverter seems adequate. Forget the batteries.If your inverter is a grid tie inverter, then you could supplement the missing power from the grid.

### Reply 2:
Thanks, How about a 5000 watt wind turbine to an inverter for the miners? I was wondering if the wind turbine could be straight lines to an outlet for power or do I need the inverter and batteries as I have seen other peoples setups? Thank you to every and anyone.

### Reply 3:
The purpose of the inverter is to convert DC into AC, which the usual PSU units expect (ironically the PSU converts it back into DC, but that's another story).The batteries are meant to give you a buffer for then the turbine isn't giving much juice, but given the amount of power required, it becomes cost prohibitive. I think it would be better to just let them shutdown when there is no wind rather than messing with expensive batteries that need to be replaced every 3 years or so anyway.By the way the same consideration applies to solar, and you can combine both.So yeah, if you have that larger 5kW turbine, it probably works for 3 miners (remember the 20/80 rule) You need a grid tie inverter if you plan to use the grid as ""battery"", if your setup is separate from the grid, a regular inverter is enough.In principle you need about 200~250v 50/60hz AC for the PSUs, how you achieve that is left to you... You might need extra things for protection and stabilization, depending. And don't forget the ground.

Topic: Is this feasable? (HYPOTHETICAL)
### Original post:
Would it be possible to halt all mining power except say 1 PH/s worth, and let the difficulty readjust normally (keep in mind that bitcoin difficulty would be 30x less), and have like a first come first serve sort of thing where for all OTHER bitcoin miners to begin mining again, they would have to sign up to a ""queue"", and be entered in as the rest of everyone ahead of them are allowed to mine again. Would this be possible? Would it actually make bitcoin difficulty MUCH easier until everyone was back in from the ""queue"", or am I just thinking too much?

### Reply 1:
Current network hash rate is about 30 PH/s, so you're talking about a decrease in hashing power of 30 fold.Difficultly adjusts so that blocks are completed on average about once every 10 minutes, therefore abruptly reducing the hash rate will result in blocks taking 30 times long... so blocks will take about 5 hours. Since difficulty only adjusts every 2016 blocks, it could take up to 420 days for difficulty to adjust to a sane level.Yeah, we should probably keep hashing away.

### Reply 2:
The purpose of mining is to secure the network. ""Free coins"" are the compensation, not the reason. It isn't feasible but if it was, it would undermine the security of the network and allow an attacker to accomplish an attack with a 97% reduction in cost.

### Reply 3:
^^^ First thing that came to my mind.

### Reply 4:
LoL I was actually thinking the same thing. Crazy idea but what if all the major pools got together and shut down befor a difficulty adjustment was about to happen.

Topic: Dead Antminer s5
### Original post:
Hi guys my antminer s5 is dead, the beagle bone died (already did the micro sd reimaging thing, it didn't work), I don't want to wait 3 weeks and spent 62$ buying a BB from amazon when i have no bullet proof tutorial about how to make it work (and add 2 months to ROI).I ask for your help because i had seen that the daughter board has two empty data connector for hashing blades and an empty fan connector.So my question is, what does it takes to build a 4 blades s5? A) Do I just connect the two blades and fan from my broken antminer? B) Connect the 2 hashing blades, and intercept the fan cables of good miner and splice them with the fan of my broken miner?I was wondering if there is no damaging side effect from doing this?I have the Jan 07 Firmware, the one that came with the 5 machines.Any help or advice that you could provide will be really appreciated .

### Reply 1:
Mine run fine with just plugging the blade cables into the S5 next to it. The only problem is the cables are short so you need to put them on their sides head to head. I use 1 fan per S5 so i use up the 2 Fan connectors.Then i put a box fan blowing air through the fins and it solve the clutter heat problem and it let me lower the fans to 25%.

### Reply 2:
The biggest thing is firmware I cannot remember which one does it but only certain ones have 4 ports active. Others you can plug it in on hashing modules and it would do nothing.I would look through S5 thread and find out which one it right firmware. Then find someone who sales the cables and get longer cables so you can leave them in old case.With those 2 things you should be able to mod one into 4 blades.

### Reply 3:
is there some reason that i am unaware of to not use the latest firmware with fan controls? Seeing how loud those things are without it, the first thing i do is flash any S5 i buy to the fan control firmware.

### Reply 4:
I don't have latest firmware and have always done fine. I don't mind loud noise from fans with it being in my mining area.But I'm kinda the type I don't upgrade unless it gives me a feature I want. I'm of the mindset if it works good... why upgrade? So I don't upgrade much.

None. Yes. Not important at all if you use a miner that supports stratum. No. Not at all. No. Yes.You don't need it unless you're using something that only can communicate via Getwork, and you want to use the more efficient stratum communications across the internet. It doesn't do anything other than that.You'd want to use the proxy if you had, for example a ASICMiner Blade which only communicates via Getwork, and you were using a pool that no longer supports Getwork. There' no other reason to use it.

### Original post:
This Group Buy is for the Neptune 3 TH KNC Miner. Order Number 12xxxDAY ONE DELIVERY This unit will be hosted in my house.I am auctioning off my shares at a cheaper rate than other group buys for the simple fact that I think .55 btc is just to <truncated> 32/64 shares @ .275 BTC each are available. The other 32 are mine.- Each share is worth approximately 50 ghs of hashing power- Each share entitles the owner to 1/64 of the BTC proceeds from a KNC Miner Neptune mining 24/7 for 6 months*, - This miner will run till it is no longer profitable. - In the event an opportunity presents itself to where I can sell it at a profit I will bring it up to the shareholders and it will require a vote. My vote will not count (since I own 1/2 the machine, but it will be decided by the shareholders)- All hosting and support services will be handled by me- All fee's are built into the share price.IN CASE OF NON DELIVERY: I take no responsibility for the possibility that KNC Miner does not deliver the miner. I have done what I consider a thorough due diligence but as we all know, you can never 100% guarantee anything when it comes to pre-orders.To purchase shares:- Send BTC.275 per share to address: <<rest of post truncated>

Topic: Keeping ASIC Miner(s) from Heating the Room?
### Original post:
I recently started mining with a newer, much larger ASIC miner and my family says it's exhaust is heating the room up. I don't know if it's truly the miner or it's the summer heat that's starting to kick in but for arguments sake let's say it is the miner. My question would be how can I keep the heat from the exhaust from raising the room temperature? Is there a to effectively direct it elsewhere or have something absorb it to keep it from dispersing across the room? The current things I have done at the moment are opening a window and bringing in fans for the room. The ASICs I have running are a BFL Jalapeno, Antminer S1, and a Hashra Lunar Launcher.

### Reply 1:
You can build a box around all the units. Usually out of some sort of foam insulation make a hole on the bottom front for fresh air. On the top of back make another hole for exhaust. Run some sort of flexible pipe out window. Problem solved. Yes this is the super simple explanation but its enough to get you started in searching for the exact design you want. Most do include fans in the exhaust to pull the heat off the asics.Steve

### Reply 2:
While you can try to route the heat out a window as described above your will most likely have to move the miners to a different room if possible. Routing heat is difficult unless close to a window.

### Reply 3:
After enjoying a winter where I never needed to run the heat in my office, I moved my miners out into the garage for the summer to keep them from driving me out of the house.

### Reply 4:
large asic units may not be safe to be close to you /your family over long periods of time , something to think about

### Reply 5:
can you provide any scientific research to support this? ASIC miners, no matter how large are simply heat producers. They aren't throwing out microwaves or any other sort of radiation beyond their thermal outputthey will warm a room but if they will shut down long before they do so to the point where it would harm a human

### Reply 6:
Some of the 1st generation bigger miners can put out insane amounts of heat. I have an Avalon 2 200 GHs miner that I had to put in the attic as it generated soo much heat in my climate controlled computer room that my air handler couldn't keep up with the heat and the room temp went from 74F to 79F with the AC running constantly. I looked at water cooling for my system as well, but I have great ventilation in the attic so was just easier to put it up there.

### Reply 7:
- Just a note on the ""foam insulation"" remember you are working with heat. You may want to go with an inexpensive heat insulation and make like a shell be sure to put the tinfoil side facing in. Leave a few inches all the way around the actual unit or units, bottom can be left open, or build a stand and then you can use regular ridged styro-foam to build the enclosure, a little duck tape and some flexible dryer exhaust hose. Decorate your enclosure as you see fit. As Steve said ""Problem solved.""

### Reply 8:
The radiation is a minimal issue unless you sleep next to the miner. Remember the intensity decreases with the square of the distance.The real issue are the chemicals released from the heated components - they give off toxic gases when heated - known as VOCs:<link>

### Reply 9:
This came up another thread. Is there any credible evidence that any current hardware gives off a meaningful amount of VOCs?

They've been taking orders for just over 2 months now.What does this mean? are we all about to get ripped off pirateat40 style or do these guys just not care about money?If it was me I would at least NEED some of the US$7,500,000 to pay for business expenses what are your thoughts?

### Reply 1:
Chips are cheap, batch 3 was expensive.I think that this is pretty much all.

### Reply 2:
It's not you, it's a business that apparently has money from previous sales or a business loan.

### Reply 3:
My view- If I had both USD and BTC and needed to spend money right now, I'd certainly use the USD if I thought that BTC would go up in value. They clearly believe that BTC will go up, and will only spend it if they have to.

### Reply 4:
Massive chip profit margin and plenty of $$ from batch 3 available. Obviously Avalon owners prefer to hang onto BTC over $$

### Reply 5:
How did they pay for chips? Simple. mine with your avalons.<link>

### Reply 6:
That defeats the point of the OP... Being that they still seem to have most of our BTC. He is wondering how they afforded to make the chips/machines without cashi g put their BTC

### Reply 7:
It doesn't really.. if they really did excessive mining with pre-ordered Avalons they could finance chip production with coins from that part of their business easily.

### Reply 8:
Holy shit! That is just disgusting.That explains how they're able to afford to pay for 1,000,000 ordered customer chips.EDIT: mind you, the blockchain address in the quote above hasn't had any money taken out of it either. so my original question still stands o.0

This forum has like the most conspiracy theories of all the forums I'm a member of. Entertaining to an extent.

yes, because communication from manufacturers is mostly one of the worst, that I ever seen on web. Guys here invest lots of hard earned dollars to them, this of course leading for conspiracy about everything..

### Reply 11:
If this was a case it would mean they are making massive profit margin on each chip. Personally I believe large profit margins are unethical, but in this case another competitor could have made a better price, and nobody did. So it's all fair game.

### Reply 12:
Thats just one address... For the other pool that was configured we don't see the transactions.

### Reply 13:
At San Jose, YiFu made the off-the-cuff remark that not all BTC transactions happened on exchanges. I took that to mean that they might engage in ""forward"" transactions for large numbers of BTC. If they could find a hedge fund (off-US-shore, i.e., Chinese or Japanese) that was willing to speculate on BTC appreciation in fiat terms, they could get their funds, and hold the BTC where they were visible as collateral.

### Reply 14:
Uh, except that over there they're talking about 700 BTC. They've sold around a million chips, which, if they're selling for around 8 bucks, are likey costing them no more than $2. That's a completely separate shenanigans accusation going on over there. Seems like it's Bash Avalon week. Just as well, since BFL is in the Good Guy camp right now and Asic miner just sits there and cranks it out, occasionally offering hardware to anyone who wants stuff to sell on eBay to collectors in a few years.

### Reply 15:
lol. BFL will never be in the good guy camp on this board. Not sure what you are talking about 700 chips.. You dont know how much they pay for them or how many other pools were ""tested on"". So yes its all specualtion, except for the proof they are mining. So far theres proof there was 2 pools configured in the guys avalon he was shipped. Thats all, and to me thats a smoking gun plain and simple they made money off customers avalons.

I'm sorry. See my edit. I'm hungry, it's past my lunchtime. But gotta say, this is an interesting forum. Guys here, overall, are really smart. That said, I reiterate: lunch time.

Yeah, somebody mined that guy's hardware. And some pretty dirty hardware was shipped. Shit was going down in China, no question.But remember a couple things here: First YiFu is really smart. At San Jose, he was able to do a lot of damage to BFL with a smile on his face, and even got a couple shots in at the mysterious and God-like Asic miner principals. So he keeps up with stuff, and the benefit/cost ratio of getting busted in something this small just seems low to me. I think what has been seen so far is equally explainable by the boxes being hi-jacked temporarily by someone in the fulfillment chain.

It depends on the final Contract that I am able to reach with the seller. Most likely yes, but I cannot promise anything until the group buy opens and I can provide purchase details etc. Most likely this will depend on what assurances and refund options that the original manufacturer leaves and it will be up to share purchasers to assess the legitimacy of those promises. the only thing I can guarantee would be delivery/refund based on manufacturer terms. I will be investing personally in the group buy and will have a vested interest in its success.

### Original post:
Can someone please explain how energy consumption in bitcoin mining is calculated? I keep hearing it is an energy intensive industry, but I know for a fact that there are industries that are a lot more polluting than Bitcoin Mining. I also keep coming across news articles that say the bitcoin mining sector is getting more green, which already makes it better than most industries. I dont understand all the unwanted hate. Anyway, if you guys could exaplain the basic calculations, it would be of great help.

### Reply 1:
Energy consumption? Are you sure? It depends on what unit model you have sample you have an s9 miner with 14th/s the watts are 1500w as a sample this is a calculation below for 1 day of mining.You mine s9 miner in 24 hours so 1500w24=36,000 and then <truncated> your consumption in 1 day you can times it into Electricity rate and times it to 30 days that should be your monthly Electricity bill.If you talking about the hash rate and profitability then use a calculator like this one below.- <link>

### Reply 2:
You can also see in real time how much is approximately the total electricity consumption of the bitcoin network over the past 24 hours, as well as min and max consumption, but of course all this is an assumed value, but giving a general idea.<link>

### Reply 3:
Depends on the infrastructure, actually. Some machines are more efficient than others, and therefore consume less energy for the same work. Nobody knows the exact number, but you can make an estimation based on the hash rate and the energy required for the most efficient machine to hash. You can assume every hash is being produced by the most efficient, and figure out what's the least energy consumed for mining.The financial sector, first and foremost.

### Reply 4:
The energy consumption of bitcoin mining is calculated by determining the total amount of energy used by the miners to solve the complex mathematical equations required to validate bitcoin transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. This energy consumption is typically measured in terms of kilowatt-hours (kWh), which is a unit of energy consumption that reflects the amount of energy used by an electrical device over the course of one hour.

wavelengths can i send you a message? I am struggling a took some screen shots but can not figure out how the hell to post them on here- Noob problems and is solo mining really wasteful? I thought it was the fastest best way to recoup your ROI- and with the current rate blocks are being found and data on fork.lol it seems the probability is increasing- I have more power that If i found a block which I want to know if i did that I would dedicate all my power to solving that block...

### Reply 4:
Solo mining is the absolute slowest and worst way to try and recoup costs. It is literally a lottery ticket, like a 1 in 14 million or worse chance of finding a block.Not sure what you are talking about with the fork.lol data. If you see blocks are being found faster than 10 minutes that means the difficulty will go up a bunch on the next adjustment to keep those numbers in line. Its not getting easier to find a block, its getting much harder.

### Reply 5:
The problem with solomining at lower hashrates is insane variance. By pool mining you reduce variance and therefore you get more stable and consistent payouts. Like Fanatic previously said, unless you're looking for a lottery ticket, don't solomine.If you're looking for a pool, Kano.is is a great option. Lower fees than most pools I know, active and overall nice owner.

### Reply 6:
I'm running a local p2pool (in the terminal) and the status of the s9 shows it's working, i think!If I understand correctly the local hashrate should be the same as the one I see in the miner's status? the other thing would be the pool hash which as pointed out is quite high? any clues what am I missing?<link>

### Reply 8:
I dont know what you are doing and what kind of crazy numbers you keep coming up with.Your miner is reporting wildly inaccurate speeds. The s9 is a 13.5TH miner (or 14th depending on recent batches)You need to stop using p2pool and just point your miner at a normal PPS payout style pool if you ever want this to work for you. Your miner will make over $750/month before power costs, not sure why you are saying the pools are not profitable.

### Reply 9:
If you want to try solo mining, then use the solo pool from ck, so you will need no local bitcoind:<link> if you think a pool is better, then use his normal pool with no fees for you, that will be the better choice!<link> good luck anyway

I think you are severely underestimating how difficult it is to find a block.

Is it possible to access the controllers on these units via serial connection? If so, you could grab a cheap UART to USB adapter from somewhere like SparkFun and see if you're able to open a terminal connection.

### Reply 5:
I haven't heard of it being done on an S9 yet but you can try the boot from microsd option. I had actually ordered a new microsd card and adapter to try this but before the stuff arrived I had figured out a solution for my issue so I never tried it.<link>

Topic: CUDA Kernel for Phoenix - interest? Possible?
### Original post:
So, I got to thinking... phatk or poclbm should be able to be ported to native CUDA (since OpenCL-over-CUDA gives us that 100% CPU problem), or at the very least, take what existed in rpcminer-cuda (or other binary-only miners) and make it work with Phoenix.Seems that a lot of miner-users don't bother with downloading the whole Python+PyOpenCL (and its massive jumble of dependencies) thing, and Phoenix was started with the idea of modular kernels but not many people have taken it up on that offer. Seems like it should be possible... I just spent so much time trying to get a (native, non-MinGW) build of Phoenix working on Windows, and I kept running into irritating issues where the prebuilt versions of components (like Boost) were hardwired for older versions of Python and all needed to be recompiled! With all this recompiling, I may as well just start tweaking some things, right?Anyone know of any particular limitations?

### Reply 1:
I don't see any reason why native CUDA mining couldn't be done, but it wouldn't gain you much of any performance improvement.

### Reply 2:
Aye, it likely wouldn't. But I think Falcon, and many of us are more concerned with the 100% cpu bug that has existed in OpenCL for some time now. Would it fix that or is that more of an embedded bug in the ATI hardware that just isn't fixable at the software level?

### Reply 3:
CUDA mining seems to be about as fast as OpenCL mining on CUDA (nVidia) hardware, but the difference is the <truncated> CPU usage - which is what keeps me from running it on my laptop, which brings the CPU to full roar (Turbo Boost) when I run a miner that gobbles 100% CPU. The laptop has Optimus, so mining CUDA at full speed doesn't affect my desktop responsiveness even one iota. I think using real CUDA would also enable the miner to be more efficient on the hardware, as many of the old miners were built on the premise of ""OMG! It works! 3 million hashes a second, OMG!"", and never got any love/attention when AMD GPUs started cranking out more like ""OMG! 300 million hashes a second! I need new underwear!"". I'm sure if we go back and dust the cobwebs off the old CUDA miner code, there could be a decent performance boost to be gained from tweaking a few lines and spending a few hours on it As for a name, that's easy. ""falcudami"" - as in FALcon's CUDA MIner? Catchy, silly, or shut up and get with the code?

### Reply 4:
I'd slap a Falcudami sticker on my box if you can make some code that will improve CUDA performance. I've got a shiney, new Gigabyte GTX 460 dual fan sitten' in the box I'd be happy to test it on too.

### Reply 5:
set <truncated> to Core 0 (via Task manager) and enjoy low CPU load...

### Reply 6:
we know, homie, we know. It is still unacceptable that is uses 100% of one core. I've got 4 cards each in 2 different systems, one; 1 core out of 2(second core), and 1 core out of four respectivly(4th core). On the dual core there is more heat loss from the cpu than from the vid cards. its annoying....

### Reply 7:
+5 Bitcoins for a Cuda Kernel in Phoenix...That cpu bug in opencl is driving me nuts. The rpcminer-cuda does not have the same problem.

Topic: App which shutting down PC automatically if gpu temp reach a certain value
### Original post:
And also drop frequency of gpu to minimal before shutting it down. Such soft exists? I don't want to burn with my OCed gpu if something will go wrong while I'm sleeping.

### Reply 1:
Yes, I made on myself. First it will(depending on the miner, in my case it's cgminer) request via RPC to stop the offending thread. Should it fail, it will kill the miner altogether. It will then bench if the temp is still going above the threshold, in which case it will shutdown the PC.It also detects FAN failure, and immediately shutdowns PC should it stop, or decrease below 700RPM.I've posted this a few times actually, and before I realized it, I was bragging Of course, it is for Windows only.

### Reply 2:
cgminer has built-in temperature and fan control. I dont think it can shutdown the rig, but it will control fan speeds to maintain a desired temperature, decrease clocks automagically if temps exceed a given treshold and stop the GPU altogether if it exceeds another treshold.

### Reply 3:
fwiw, most GPUs auto-shutdown once they reach a particularly unsafe operating temperature - usually exactly @ 100*C.

### Reply 4:
Most people wouldn't want to go there. And CGminer's auto fan and clock control, didn't work for me.

### Reply 5:
No, they throttle, they dont shutdown.And 100C is way above what I consider safe.

### Reply 6:
Then you didnt configure it right. It works perfectly. I use it on one rig to maintain maximum clock for a given noise level (fixed fan speed) and temperature. cgminer varies the clock to meet those, and will shut down the GPU when it cant. On my other rigs its set to vary fan speed to maintain temperatures at a fixed clock speed. And you can combine that. Its pretty awesome really

### Reply 7:
At least ASUS 5850s I have shutdown automatically. I had a particular box with poor airflow during summer, and whenever the primary card hit 100*C, it'd immediately shut off. There was no garbage, the miners acted normally -- the primary card (which was hottest) immediately spun down and stopped updating the monitor. I guess it could've just been the settings becoming screwy when it throttled down.

### Reply 8:
Ive had a reference 5850 that due to a bug got fed 1.65V for an hour or so. It kept mining during that time even though the GPU was throtteling at 100C and the VRMs were cooking at 130+C. I do know it was throttled because I got like 50 MH/s instead of 350+. No shutdown. So I wouldnt count on it.

### Reply 9:
Sounds great, where I can get it? Btw CGminer can be used as just temp control tool in addition to Phoenix?

### Reply 10:
Dont think so. But there are other reasons to consider it as your miner app, like failover pools.

### Reply 11:
cgminer supports phatk2? I'm getting best results with it. Sorry for noob question, but what's failover pools?

### Reply 12:
phatk2 is integrated in cgminer.Failover pool is that you can define multiple pools. If one pool fails, for whatever reason, like when it comes under DDOS attack or whatever, cgminer switches to the next pool. Or you can even revert to solo mining if all your pools are down, just configure localhost as one of your pools.

Topic: Antminer s1 problem
### Original post:
Hi all,I received my 2nd Antminer S1 from Bitmain today, plugged it in and the fan went straight to what seemed 100%- way way much louder than my first. I turned it off to investigate and noticed the cable from the control board to one of the blades was loose (the blade with the fan plug on it)Anyway, i plugged this in correctly and turned it on. no fan- but the other blade started hashing. I unplugged the blade that had the initial loose connection, and the fan started again.So basically, it will hash on the blade without the fan connection with the fan running like mad, but as soon as i plug second blade in the fan stops.Any ideas folks?

### Reply 1:
Replace the fan

### Reply 2:
You think a faulty fan would stop one of the blades from hashing!!??

### Reply 3:
Remove fan and attach it to other end of AntMiner.

### Reply 4:
I will try that when I get home from work, using the other fan plug though- won't that make the fan run on full all the time though? I didn't think the far end fan plug was speed controllable?

### Reply 5:
Check the temps, does one blade show 127C?. I received an S1 that did that and it turned out to be a bad temp sensor. The sensor is located right in the middle of the blade. It is an 8-pin device that has ""LM75"" on top. After I replaced the sensor, the fan(s) behaved normally.Hope this helps!

### Reply 6:
Hi there,Thank you for all your help, all sorted now, I removed all the ribbon cables and refitted them, and all is good now!Both Hashing away at 375 now quite happily!Just need to put a pull fan on the back of my new S1 now, I can see around -3 degrees on my first unit with a cougar fan.Cheers guys!

Can you get to the screen which shows a login into the antminer using root?Do you have an IP address for each antminer like 192.168.1.XXX and is it on the same address range as your regular router, the 192.168.1.XXX ? If you have the router set up as 192.168.2.XX, then something on the 192.168.2.XXX range will NOT connect to it automatically.

### Reply 7:
Thanks I added that and and change the default DNS in one of the other ant miners to 8.8.8.8 and both of them show nothing in the status page.My pool is set to <link> i added the worker name and a pass. Still nothing.Can they run on the same subnet, e.g. 192.168.1.XXX, the router is on this subnet too.

### Reply 8:
Probably having trouble connecting to the pool if it's online but not mining. Have you tried connecting it to one of the big ones just to see if it will work?

### Reply 9:
Yes, the Antminers run on the same subnet.For your mining configuration, try just entering this:Pool1 <truncated> worker Bitcoin addressPassword anything Save and apply, give it a minute, then check status again.

### Reply 10:
Tried that and still no status. I opened the ports on the router too, nothing.

### Reply 11:
Try changing pool to BTCGuild or Eligius. Sometimes those smaller pools are iffy.

### Reply 12:
Finally got it working, the gateway was wrong.I made, what I hope isn't a hopeless case. I accidentally changed the IPv4 address of one of my miners into the broadcast range when I changed the wrong field. One miner is now on 192.168.1.255.Can this be fixed? Is there a way to access the miner directly from an ethernet connection to a computer and ssh into the mac address of the machine and launch the config page?

### Reply 13:
You can try Code:ssh <truncated> it might be easier to just hit the factory reset button on the controller and start fresh...

aaahhh. Thanks a lot! Found it hiding there. Thanks for the help everyone.

Try windpath's suggestion, worst case start from scratch with a factory reset:

software got nothing to do with mining. you mine with hardwer, software is just tool to operate hw.you can't earn anything with 11mh/s. I made a math for you.if difficulty stays on 609 mil forever you will need little over 300 years to earn 1btc!and I'm not kidding!with 11mh/s and 609 mil diff you will earn 0.00027593 BTC/month, so 1BTC : 0.00027593 BTC = 3624 months.3624 months : 12 = 302 years!!!so if you are not willing to spend 5000-10000 dollars on some decent equipment you can forget about mining.

11MH/s??? If you're solo mining that will never get you anything. If you want to even make some dust of a bitcoin join a pool like btcguild. You might get a 0.001 btc in a year at that hash rate. If you want to make some type of btc from mining you need something called an ASIC. They sell USB ASIC's on ebay which are going for around $30 right now. You will never ROI though.

I have 4 S2's that arrived yesterday. 1 looked like it was thrown down 20 flights of stairs (backplane bent to hell) and non-functional. So as mentioned above, you need to undo the ~15 screws and look inside. The box mentioned above had both the ribbon cable to the controller and the network cable undone internally as so many cards were dislodged in shipment.I did have 2 units arrive in good condition but sadly only one of the four is operating to spec (~ 1Th/s). Hoping to get this sorted in the coming days...

### Reply 1:
I use BTCGuild exclusively, and have been having the problem that when a fresh phoenix is started, the GPU usage is a straight 99% line, but over several days it turns into a sine wave from 90% - 99% , which means the GPU's are not being fully used.Could this be related?

### Reply 2:
Been having this issue also.

### Reply 3:
It could be either that or the GPU overheating and running some form of load reduction. I've seen both effects. You can most easily test it by switching to a different pool, or by monitoring the GPU temperature and clocks. Basically, when the GPU overheats, it clocks down. On the other hand, mining on a machine with some swap memory (paging file) could cause the same effect due to leaks - on my miners it just gets the system to kill the leaking worker, with no leak related slowdown - but that's because my miners have very little RAM, and no swap memory.

### Reply 4:
This doesn't seem to be the case.I'm having the same thing happen. I'm running phoenix 1.50+ phatk, with BTCguild. I start out with a perfect steady 99% for many hours. Then over 1-2 days, the usage gets very unstable, bouncing between 96-98%. A restart (no real rest time) immediately fixes the problem.If it was overheating, then a stop/restart with no other changes, and a fraction of a second pause wouldn't completely erase the problem for hours to come.

### Reply 5:
The most obvious difference between the two is that btcguild supports long polling while slush doesn't...

### Reply 6:
That sounds very much like the miner process is leaking memory. Your throughput percentage begins to drop as the OS begins swapping more and more virtual memory to/from disk while the process tries to push work to the GPU. My recommendation is to just restart every miner daily, if that's feasible.I suspect that the mem leak is being caused by twisted. I've used it before and I had horrible leakage. It takes a lot of care and attention to avoid. I'd like to file & track a bug for it. Is there a page for the phoenix-miner project to do that?

### Reply 7:
I found a fix to my sine-wave load usage problem, or at least cut it in half - set both phoenix.exe's to ""Below Normal"" process priority. I know it's counter-intuative, but trust me.If you want to use it in your batch file, do this:start /belownormal phoenix.exe <arguments>To the OP: Sorry I kinda derailed your thread amigo

### Reply 8:
I don't think the memory leak is caused by twisted. I wrote a proxy hopper using it and it doesn't leak although it is doing roughly the same operation.Over a couple days my hoppers memory is constant while phoenix's will increase.

you can't expect anything.330Mh is so low that there is no point mining with it even if you get it for free.to show you how pointless it is, I have 3x60GH/s BFL and with 180GH I can earn 0.05BTC/day.1180GH compared to 0.333GH!!! absurd to even try to mine with it.second thing you can't mine LTC with asic. asic can mine only sha-256 coins.also there is no point of mining ppc or any other sha-256 coin since btc is most profitable.there is no minimum system requirements for pc used for running asic miner.any computer will do the job since you are not mining with it, you are mining with asic miner and computer is there only to run mining software.also newer asic miners are standalone miners. they have mining software installed inside so the only need to be connected to router.

### Reply 4:
I have a few rigs (scrypt coins based on 3 x GPUs : 2000Mhs each)and a new bitcoin miner (30GHs)When I started I thought I would make money, and was considering starting a business around it.Now I've got a bit of experience, I am much more interested in this as a hobby and to support the network.I may not make my investment money back (I've covered about 30% of my costs so far over the last 2-3 months so fully expect to end up out of pocket)If you want to make money, and believe in <truncated> then you're better off just investing in the currency (ie buy bitcoins)If you want to start a new (expensive) hobby, then get into mining. Scrypt or SHA256 doesn't matter - its not a money making investment.Now I've done both, once you know what you are doing, bitcoining mining with standalone cubes is much more reliable and easy to set up than scrypt mining with milkcrate rigs. My rigs give me periodic grief

### Reply 5:
If your on a budget, Your best bet is going with scrypt coins such as litecoins and DOGEcoins etc.You can mine those coins on your CPU and Graphics Card, or both at the same time. Do not buy anything used as its way overpiced, even for those popular fast BTC miners, people tend to be greedy and its their gain, Your loss, Because you will have a ROI in 3 months.So, Its all to a matter of preference.

Thanks, I've been mulling this or something similar for like a year now. After searching every page on the internet I realized no one was going to hand me a plug and play model.I love what you are talking about and I think a lot of people have the same issue as us. You can see on my meter I'm always over 240 and all that gear may have a hard stop at that voltage. I remember you talking about it a few weeks ago and if I didn't have the M20 options to exceed that I'd probably be asking you for the steps to build one now. By all means if you do a build and create a thread or video let me know I'll link to it all day long. Here and in the First time miners thread. Seeing as some newbies out there in the near future may not have a choice if more gear moves towards a 240 hardcap.

This is a DIY project because you have to, that is unless you want to spend some serious cash on a PDU with these features. I made this prototype for myself just to have a working model and then see where I can improve upon the design. In all honesty though I'm not going to need this very often but it's nice to be able to check new gear as it arrives. This will allow you to confirm for yourself the power draw of your miners among other things depending on the model you choose.So here's the only link that really matters. It's the critical component the Multi-function power meter. There are so many designs out there but they all have some minor differences in their ratings for: Voltage, Current, and Frequency.The model I settled on is rated well beyond anything I will throw at it.6-in-1 Digital tester My model came with the current transformer and the setup is super simple by following the visual installation. I settled on this model so I could get readings over 3000 W as I'm expecting an M20S.

Nice idea.I recently was building a diy transformer to pdu.

It wastes around 20 watts to run 2 units.Would be very nice to link it in with your meter project.

Nice. I rigged up a similar setup on all the 3-phase lines coming into my hosting before being split to the various shelves so I can monitor realtime loads and keep the phases close to balanced. Didn't have the watts readout, just volts and amps. For the watt-hour meters for hosting customers I went low-tech and bought a bunch of retired house electric meters for like $25 apiece.

Common and to code up here in CanadUS . I'm not a fan of them as I don't have the trade tricks for tight spaces, funny you mention the Wago connectors I bought a few packs the other day from the hardware store when I was looking around.

Topic: Should cgminer need different settings for different coins of same algorythm?
### Original post:
Hey peeps,I've got a weird problem. I've a rig which is quite happy mining LTC using scrypt but when I switch to FTC it dies after a few hours. I am using exactly the same settings, just different pools. My assumption has always been that what works with cgminer for one scrypt coin should work for all scrypt coins, and likewise with SHA256. In other words I should only have to tune each rig for SHA256 and scrypt, then I can point them at whatever flavour of coin I like. Is this not the case?Kate.

### Reply 1:
That's right, generally. Some different settings might be needed for brand new coins in Orphan City mode (like Expiry 1, Queue 0, Scantime 1), but past that point all settings should be the same. If you have -I 12 <truncated> 8192 for one scrypt coin, you'll have -I 12 for <truncated> for any other scrypt coin.Only thing that changes and MIGHT cause isssues would be difficulty with the coin/pool. Nothing that should crash the card, though, just maybe have extra rejects.

### Reply 2:
I do run my machines quite close to their limits so perhaps it is just the additional load of small blocks / more rejects from FTC that was causing it. Also, FTC was/is being attacked so that could cause subtle differences in the workload I guess.Anyway, thanks for confirming what I thought re. scrypt is scrypt. Kate.

This is perfectly normal. All mining machines do it. It's just a variation on how quickly the chips are processing the work. When you have a look on the GUI it will read the correct Ghs and also on the pool it will read the correct Ghs on each shift.

### Reply 3:
Your sample size to evaluate your hashing was simply not big enough.You probably just started them and recorded a spike.You're right to say that over a long period of time it should be around 600 or a bit less.

Hi all,I am new with bitcoin mining and I wanted to try it.So basically I buyed a antminer s3 and a cx500m power suplier I've connected the cable with the pci-e to the antminer but when I turn on the power supplier it does nothing. I don't know what the problem is and I hope somebody can help me.Thanks in advance!

I see several people have pledged to buy shares. Does that mean that they haven't paid anything towards their shares? If so when do you plan on collecting the payments? Do you plan to order the miner once funds have been collected or have you already ordered it? Did I read the first post correctly you have 10 shares paid for and another 25 pledged? I apologize for bombarding you with questions... Thx, GrapeApe Edit: I was reading this earlier on my phone and yes I know I had this all confused (I'm a jackass). I have answered most of my own questions by reading the thread and going to your website. This seems like a pretty good deal, I'll be honest I am stretched a little thin because of some other group buys but I am going to see what I can put together and try and get at least 2 shares. By the way I am in Austin Tx where Cointerra is based and what this means I don't know but I felt the need to share. I'll be in touch...

Topic: How to access miner in case of hosted mining?
### Original post:
How the miners are accessed in case of hosted mining, as advertised by many hosted bitcoin miner providers?

### Reply 1:
Usually they are not accessible.They point to a pool they pick for you, possibly because they make money in other ways (merged-mining).Or, you purchased a share of a large machine which has to be subdivided and must point to a pool of the hosting companies choosing. They do the math there and pay you on your share.If you own the entire machine at the hosting company then maybe, they will let you point it to anything you want, this is hard to find I think...

### Reply 2:
Depends on the hoster. Many will offer you a web interface to control some aspects of your miner, while others will give you discrete IP address/port to use to access your miner via its own web interface, and some will additionally give you an IP address/port for ssh access. Often they will give you all of them. Check with your hosting company as to what they offer before you sign up.

Topic: SP20E Proper Fan Connector?
### Original post:
Hey guys... I just got my hands on another SP20E for a decent price... Problem is, the guy modded it with a custom fan, which doesn't seem to be hooked up properly, or something... Maybe that'll be a different thread, because that's pissing me off in and of itself, and if I can get that working, at least I'll have a fan to use <truncated> I guess it's the typical connector used for these units. The fan is a standard 4-pin, and it goes to this mini 4-pin on the SP20's board... Problem is, the guy inclided the stock fan, and not the adapter, so now I can't run the thing anyway. Ideally, I would like to get both fans running, but the simplest thing right now would be to get this adapter. I'll try to fix the other fan as well, but here's the adapter from the stock fan, to the board. What adapter would I need? <link>

### Reply 1:
Also, I'm going to put it in another post I guess, but the other fan is a delta SP09 or something like that. It's this heavy 230cfm fan, and the guy custom wired it to a PCIE peripheral connector. The red on the fan is going to the yellow on the wires, and the black is going to the black... But for some reason, it's not working... When I hit the PSU switch, the wire actually ""jumps"", (literally moves) then the PSU goes off. Fan does nothing... The red on the fan is wired to all 3 of the yellows and taped off, and the black on the fan is wired to all 3 of the black on the wires, and the other two wires (blue and brown) are just off separately, not attached to anything...

Regarding the S3.I don't have the build environment to create a full binary image, and the code will need a LOT of work to actually become part of mainline cgminer it seems, but for the time being here is a link to a bugfixed binary of cgminer 4.6.0 for the S3 based on the bitmain code. Copy the file into /usr/bin/ on the S3 overwriting the existing one:<link>

I'm not sure where you're seeing these messages. There hasn't been any GPU code in mainline cgminer for over a year and I'm not supporting anything but the current version.

### Reply 9:
Thanks @ckolivas.This is the output of cgminer.I use it to mine on testnet. There are 4 radeon 79xx gpu cards, and according to cgminer stats it does ~2.5gh/s - I was hoping to mine something, especially that current testnet difficulty == 1.0, but it doesn't work, hence I posted this warning(?) messages.

### Reply 10:
Which version?

### Reply 11:
ckolivas, any idea why the new firmware & cgminer version on the s3 would stop access via the API? I don't have an s3 yet, mine will be here soon though, they have been shipped from china... but in the meantime users of my app are saying when they upgrade firmware and install newest version of cgminer app doesn't have access to api. they've said they still have api access enabled.when I wrote the app I used the API specs that were in github. it worked before the update.i'll be able to test when my s3 come but thought maybe someone knew off that top of their head

### Reply 12:
I suspect there will be people mining at home for fun pretty much forever. And home mining for profit has been pretty much impossible for years - at least not without a huge amount of luck - although many people let wishful thinking cloud their judgment.Thanks for the new release - I will test it out on a couple of Monarchs shortly :-)roy

ok. I might be end user error. I didn't think the API would change all of a sudden

Not immediately detecting my Monarchs.Am I right in thinking that all I should need is --enable-bflsc at build time (and nothing special at run time)?

### Reply 16:
Ah, it appears that production Monarchs (or at least these two) have iProduct set to ""BitFORCE SHA256"". A quick edit of usbutils.c and we're hashing (albeit with a warning at startup about an unknown firmware version).Note that this iProduct string seems to be the same as the old BFL FPGAs. I've no idea whether this matters - although I'm not compiling the old bitforce driver so it clearly doesn't matter to me.

### Reply 17:
S3 disables write access to the API and ignores the _aa setting.I'm not sure which versions do this setting or if it is all of them.I've had 3 different versions (my first S3 controller board went strange and Bitmain replaced it quickly for me) so I'm not sure.In /etc/init.d/cgminer mine <truncated> $POOL1 $POOL2 $POOL3 $_pb $_ow $_bec --api-listen --api-network <truncated> --bitmain-hwerror --queue 4096""Instead I change it <truncate<rest of thread truncated>

Can we just stop with these BS announcements? You have nothing to sell right now. When you do, start an auction or sale and people will buy from you. No promotion is necessary in this market.

### Reply 16:
You are too late to the ASIC game. There are at least three companies that have ASICs developed already, and you are a fool if you think those three companies aren't working on improved versions (well, maybe not BFL, lol). That's A LOT of competition and developing an ASIC takes a lot of money and a long time.These companies are selling their machines WAY over their cost because that is what the market will bear right now. ASICs in large quantities are cheap. Expect them to get cheap and competition to get tougher. And most importantly, difficulty will skyrocket.In the not too distant future (within a year), we will be able to buy ASIC machines with about 100 GH/sec power that run at about 100 watts and cost a few hundred dollars. The difficulty will be such that the ROI for such a machine will be 1-2 years, so mining will be mostly for fun and small profits, not the cash cow it is now.

You could get a 30 amp breaker, assuming you have the electricty compacity for it. Make sure to use proper electric cabling for it and nice plug. I would not go though the welding plug unless you are for sure the wire can handle the 220. So it kinda varies on anwser depending on setup. But then you would go from receptical to PDU which allows both SP30's to run on it.

You will need to have decent power, most use a powered hub to get this. Also use a Y-USB connetor ( <link> ) Allows twice the power as 1 usb cord would.Use the compac-cgminer and it's pretty simple from there. I would suggest a little fan if you are doing this to push air.

A u2 can do freq 225 but will need a fanSidehacks sticks can do freq 400 but will need a fanThe u2 is hotter the sidehacks stick so if you oc use a fan.

About 10 stock up to about 50 if you're really pushing it. 20-25GH should be doable with a 1A port.

### Reply 20:
If by ""sizeable amount"" you mean ""more than zero"" nope, I have not gotten a sizeable amount of anything from anyone since the BM1384 purchase end of June.40GH would probably take more than 2A of 5V. Probably take 2.5V at that point, since the chip would be drawing 10.5W by itself plus conversion losses and controls. I'd estimate 12W into the stick at 40GH, which my base Compac design will handle.I could buy an S7 and part it out, but the chips would then cost a little over three times what I paid for my BM1384 stock. End cost for the stick would be more like $30-35 than $25 and it'd take about seven S7 to prototype and run out a full 1000-stick batch. Technically possible but probably stupid.

Keep up the work side!! Got a few people at work that are going to buy a few of the USB miners with me . Have my first one running 2 days now .It seems I could clock these up to like 20GH/s if I cooled it well.

### Reply 22:
Sounds like a expensive R/D if you have to use the unit itself. I keep hoping someone will release a chip and make competition and they will sell you a batch.I think it might be a while but I think Innosilicon is a likely one to sell chips, unless BW and LKETC take all they can produce. Would be nice of BM to sell them to you. You should push you can help them sell R1's if they sell chips to you and make your product supported on it. Can't imagine anyone not wanting one if for 25 or a tad more you could push 25 to 40 GH of extra hash from R1.

### Reply 23:
The Compac has been tested to work (enumerating as a U3) on an R1, if I'm remembering right. A Compac2 with 1385 would require specific software so not <truncated> I didn't think about trying that angle with Bitmain though.I am more optimistic about Innosilicon selling chips, but since they thus far have no interest in small quantities or samples it seems getting anything even for testing is months away which puts production more months away.Also, all this should probably be discussed in a dev th<rest of thread truncated>

Topic: 2GH NinjaStick USB Miner powered by Bitfury
### Original post:
MineNinja is pleased to announce our newest product, the NinjaStick USB Bitcoin mining stick powered by the Bitfury 5GH ASIC. It's done right with adjustable voltage and a temp sensor - actual performance is still TBD ~ but we anticipate at least 2GH. These will be available only on a wholesale basis, MOQ 100 sticks - orders will open once the prototype is hashing and evidence posted to youtube. Estimated Pricing:September production - estimated price 2BTC per stickOctober production (using October deliver Bitfury chips) - estimated 1BTC per stickFinal pricing is still TBD, and depends on factors like volume. The more interest, the cheaper we can get them made. I'm also looking for the ""right"" partner/investor to help with the project. It's not just about money, rather what you can bring to the table to help facilitate growth.

US. It'll have to be after more details are announced. It'll probably be for the October date and depends on the price and difficulty. Right now Avalon K16s are 4.5 GH/s stock @ around $260 (hopefully delivered by September). 2BTC = around $230 for 2 GH/s so I'm not sure it'd be worth it for the September sticks.

0.5BTC/Gh/s in October? Might be a fun toy ~1btc, but anyone paying 100BTC would be taking a huge risk in their ability to resell them for a profit, and they certainly wouldn't be very worthwhile to use in a big mining op.

At 2BTC that's $113 per GH/s which is a total joke.Even 1BTC you would be lucky to get any ROI by the time it ships. It needs to sell for less than 1BTC if it can't then don't start the project.

And this is the first signs of what will happen to NON-USB ASIC's in October or November 2013.Companies will figure out that their initial designs can't easily overcome pricing restrictions. So they will have to redesign Gen2.1 to be more massively parallel to keep outrunning the difficulty by any meaningful timeframe.(You heard it here first! Expect many companies to pre-plan, adapt to changing market conditions, or utterly fail and take your money/BTC with them. Spend wisely.)

### Reply 27:
The block erupters will be at .12 BTC is the next few weeks. This new device should be around .45 @ least 2gh/s to be worthwhile.

### Reply 28:
We're doing everything we can to get the price down as low as possible, but please have reasonable expectations as we can't sell them for less than the chips cost, plus theres a bunch of other parts, board, heatsink, and NRE costs that we have to recover. These small units aren't going to have the world's best ROI, you can only get that promise when you buy $5k worth of vaporware. Real things in hand cost more than powerpoint slides and renderings. Anyhow we are trying to keep a sub $100 price point to give entry level miners some meaningful hashrate.

As I understand it, in China much shipping is done by proxy as it were. How many times have you heard ""we've handed the shipment off and are waiting for tracking numbers from the shipper""?I think it's entirely possible that the handoff had already occurred when the refund was requested.I'm not saying that BitSyncom hasn't failed in multiple major areas, but I'm not sure if you can justifiably lay blame on them in this particular case.

### Reply 11:
Why? They are a US company.

### Reply 12:
1) We ordered the chips from Avalon, not from the proxy.2) The status for refund is OK, so we requested for refund according to WTF Avalon promised that any chip ordered any time can get refund. Avalon didn't say that they have shipped the chips and told us we can't get refund after Avalon hand over the chips to the proxy. It's possible that the handoff had already occurred, but their order system didn't say it, so it's not our fault.3) So many group buyers are blaming them.

### Reply 13:
First off, I am sorry to hear this. I wonder if the shipper had the chips before the 17th and they were the delayed in getting them out but in Avalon's mind it was shipped after the refund request? I would try to ascertain when the chips were given to the shipper.

### Reply 2:
This is a good sign that all 3 boards are still good, here are the three possible reasons.1- Voltage:if you are not feeding the miner with 200-240v it could act weird and not be able to power on 3 hashboards.2-PSU is dying:Due to unregulated voltage or simply bad luck, the PSU can't feed enough power for all boards3-The data-cableMake sure you test all three of them by swapping them.also can you tell us what is the exact voltage you plugging the miner to? please notice these new gears take voltage very seriously, anything above 240v or below 200 vots is simply a free ride to RMA.

### Reply 3:
I'm starting to think the same.. i guess the last attempt is to disassemble the PSU and look for any obvious damage.Thank you both!

### Reply 4:
If you confirmed that all 3 hash boards work just fine, i think it would be best to buy a new PSU, for two main reasons. First one is this PSU is not good and it could damage the hash boards eventually, so there is a good amount of risk in keeping it. The second reason is economically based, T17 40th makes about 6.3$ a day (before electricity bill) so every board makes a good 60$ a month, T17 PSU costs 134$, say 30$ for shipping. you are looking at about 160$. If your power cost is 5 cents then PSU ROI will be about 5 months.if you decide to keep on mining with only 2 boards, at least sell the other one that's sitting there doing nothing. Just 2 two sats.

### Reply 5:
Have you tried the other solution above? If you confirmed that the PSU is good then I would like to suggest moving the miner on the other outlets or plug the miner directly to the wall outlet then test it again. Because sometimes extensions can't handle high wattage and can't give enough power to the miner.

### Reply 6:
Did you manage to find any fix to this issue? One of my T17+ machines is acting the same. I get the same info in log, 1-2 hours of mining one of boards stops hashing. After a reboot it works fine for few hours then issue repeats.

### Reply 1:
With Bitmain beeping most often means no network connection but might be overtemp warning. The fans working? If not it will very rapidly overheat and stop the boot process causing the same thing.Unlike the S5 and earlier models the chips cannot be salvaged -- the heatsinks are held on with thermal epoxy and are extremely difficult to remove without damaging the chip.

### Reply 2:
The problem is depend on your home internet that have only dynamic ip address but you have setting up Antminer S7 by (x) static ip. When S7 is using static ip address it has to use your Internet provider DNS + Gateway that not allow you to use static ip address. If you turn off (untick) static ip address in S7 setting is will be ok again.Better if you can apply to get a static ip from your home ISP. I am paying $7/m extra to get static ip address for my Bitmain Antminer s7.

### Reply 3:
This is 100% false. Removing the heatsinks carefully is not all that hard. I can pull an entire board of S7 heatsinks off in 20 minutes without damaging the chips. The secret is to heat the smaller bottom heatsink and pull it off first. If you heat the larger heatsink it will pull the heat through to the bottom heatsink and melt the solder holding the chip in place, causing you to pull the chip off along with the heatsink in most cases. Also make sure you are not pulling straight up on the heatsink, twist a little when pulling so you are almost rocking the heatsink back and forth and peel it off slowly.

### Reply 4:
Whatever you do, do NOT follow these instructions. This guy is giving his machine an EXTERNAL IP with his setup leaving it completely vulnerable and open to the public internet to be hacked. The beeping is due to it not sensing internet. It can be a number of things. IP conflict, DNS issues, bad network cable, etc. I would verify all settings as well as swapping with a known good cable. Also you might want to factory reset the controller in cause something got borked in the configs. You can do this by using a toothpick to push in the reset button to the right of the ethernet port. Hold it down until you see both red and green lights blink at the same time and it beeps. This will put it back to DHCP so you can then find its IP, browse to it, and put all of your settings back in.

### Reply 5:
Gotta keep in mind the general audience here... Given the posts we've seen folks make most have minimal to zero skill sets for this.Even then, good luck reusing the s7-s9 chips. Even Sidehack refuses to deal with them because of their insanely fine lead pitch.

### Reply 6:
Fair enough. I did learn how to repair the boards and have managed to reuse s7 chips on other boards successfully. The biggest issue is not knowing if the chip you are pulling off of a board is fully functional or not but it is possible with basic hand tools.

Hi Folks,I am running 2X AMD Radeon R270x with cgminer.One runs at 72 degrees, the other at 83 degrees, always 10 moreWhy is the second card 10 degrees higher? I have to run the fan full throttle to cool it which makes it noisy.Thanks for looking.

### Reply 1:
its pretty normal. the display is on the 2nd card so its doing more work i assume you have them in crossfire so the 2nd card does the display work. run the pc with no side on it should help with cooling

### Reply 2:
It's not because the display card does more work. The display card would actually run cooler then since mining (scrypt anyways) pretty much maxes out the card while basic renders for display are minimal work and actually cut the 100% throttle of mining.The #1 card (the one in the top slot) is sucking in hot air from the back of the 2nd card. If you swap the card positions you'll notice the cards will swap temp gradients.Only way to fix that is put some good distance with risers.

There would be no problems as long as you don't try to run a full high res display on it. (Even then maybe you wouldn't have problems)Bitcoin miners transfer only like a few mb/s and you can easily run any gfx card on a 1x port.

I was worried the card wouldn't clear the power connector on this board what do you guys think? I guess you could get an extender or cable or something.

Most recently I used a dremel instead of a knife. Much easier.(Cut it with the cutting disk perpendicular to the length of the PCIe slot, it takes 10sec.)

I have a Zotac NM10 board with a full-length PCIe slot that is only x1 speed. It works fine for mining and there are no power problems, since higher-power cards (currently a HD5770) use separate power cables anyway. A HD5570 that draws about 40 W (no separate power) has also worked fine.I have tried to use another GPU with an extender, since the mobo has another x1 slot, but it is normally under the heatsink of the first GPU. This did not work as expected, I could never get the total hash rate above that of a single card. I think this is due to other limitations in the mobo/CPU, since individually the GPUs work fine in their x1 slots, even with the extender.An extender/riser may be a problem when the GPU is powered via the PCIe slot, but it should be OK for separately powered cards.The Zotac is also my main HTPC, and when watching videos I simply use a higher -f setting for smoother playback. This slows down hashing quite severely, and I think a x16 slot does a lot better in these situations. But for mining only, the slowdown of a x1 slot is really only marginal.

so can i run 4x 5970 , if my mobo only has 1 x16, & 3 x1(small one), if i have 1000W + 1000W or 1500W power supply with enough power cables connected to graphics card & using x1 risers?

If the motherboard can handle the load of all of the cards, which depends on factors I am not aware of.

### Original post:
This is a part of a Group buy, that will ship and end at 07/01/2013 no matter what.(right now i am wating to be verified by miningbuddy, since i dont have any +rep here yet)I have closed my frist group buy since i had some trubbel manegeing who was in the deal and who was out, since there was some people who wanted the units to ship here and now. so this system is much to easier to manage This group buy will not have a minimum or maxumum of order, but it will close at the first of July, and all the orders will be shiped within a day after the money is in place.if you want to take place in this Group Buy, you can do it in two ways.1. Make a order on bitmit as normal. (I am using escrow, but when the day comes to make the order, you have to release the money from there before i can ship the units, since i need the bitcoins to make the order)<link> Send me a PM here on bitcointalk with the address you want the units send to and how many units you want. like so""Units 3Full nameAddress : xxxxxxxxxCity : xxxxxxxZipcode : xxxxxxxxxContry : xxxxxxxxx""Then i will make a new address in my wallet with you name on it,and When the day comes to make the order i will ask you to send the money to <rest of post truncated>

I have closed my old Group buy since there was some missunderstandings, so i have rewritten my original post, so it will be easier to understand and manege . i will give you guys a update as soon as i get verified by miningbuddy, sinde there is some members who dont have that mmuch trust to a newcomer like me. if you had a orders in the ""old"" Group buy i made please make them again since this Group buy all new, and better. I am really sorry for the trouble for my first orders

Topic: Question
### Original post:
Is anyone manufacturing the newer controller boards and modules for the current Avalon Gen1 machines (batches 1, 2 and 3) with support and the 55nm chips? I would love be able to update my B1 and B2 to a 55nm module and controller card instead of having to buy a whole new system.
