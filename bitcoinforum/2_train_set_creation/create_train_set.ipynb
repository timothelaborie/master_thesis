      "Ive been looking at the code of radeonvolt, its not complicated, but to get the info you need to know the graphic card protocol, which I dont, it takes time and its boring as hell. And for someone who already knows it, it would be quite easy to provide it, or even hack radeonvolt to accept more types of cards...I would actually pay some bitcoins to someone willing to actualize radeonvolt or AMDOverdriveCtrl (or a new one) to provide that info. Maybe we can start a bounty.EDIT: I have checked the AMD ADL Library (the one used by AMDOverdriveCtrl) and it does not allow to access current or other temprearture sensors. It actually allows to access what AMDOverdriveCtrl is already showing. To get the rest of the info you need to access the card (via i2c I believe) and its probably different for every model.If anyone is willing to upgrade radeonvolt (or AMDOverdriveCtrl or a new one) to read 5870 cards I am willing to give 5btc bounty.\n",

      "I also dump heat - (even in the winter in Wisconsin). If you only try to only provide cool air to the miner from outside - the room heat will eventually overwhelm the miners. filters are a bad idea imo they get clogged and you have a problem - you're better off having a air compressor and (carefully) blowing out the dust once a week. It's also a good idea to put some leaf/rodent proofing on the intakes - one errant leaf and mess up miner by blocking the intake - Also a 1\" gap at the inlet side of the miner - instead of a direct connection allows for blockage inspection and adequate intake temp/cfm. In the case of a rainy humid day the gap helps to equalize humidity and reduce condensation - a hash board killer.\n",

Just like you, we want the best price we can get.I suggest a tiered approach by raising funds up to the amount of each discounted quantity. Tier 1 would be for 500 A1s and no discount. Once funding is secured for Tier 1, then we move on to Tier 2 for 1000 A1s with a 2.857% discount. Having Tier 2 funded, we move on to the next tier and higher discounted price and so on... For each tier level that is reached the cost per GH/s - A1 Chip is reduced, which would give you credit towards the next tier (e.i.. You get more for the same money.)Again, this is only a test to see if there is support for a multi-group GB. SoChime in and let u<rest of post truncated>\n",

      "### Original post:\n",
      "So, I had my 5870 running cgminer 2.21 yesterday mining Bitcoins. I had catalyst 11.12 and stream sdk 2.4 and opencl 1.0Then, I downloaded reaper, configured it, downloaded catalyst 12.6 and stream sdk 2.7 with opencl 1.2.1.My computer is running windows 7 64-bit.My 5870 was not mining litecoins fine, but then I tried downloading MSI afterburner, and that's when shit went crazy.Now, not matter what I do, whether or not I try to completely uninstall my drivers and SDK and reinstall them, cgminer is telling me...It won't mine Litecoins through reaper either. It's as if my computer isn't even recognizing my graphics card. I completely uninstalled MSI afterburner and have tried completely removing my drivers and the SDK and reinstalling 3 different versions of them, and still no luck.As a side note, when I install my drivers and it goes through the process of installing Catalyst Control Center, I can see a command window pop up twice and close immediately during the installation process. It also seems as though the installation process goes faster than normal and the progress bars don't complete all the way during the \"detecting graphics hardware\" and \"installing new display drivers\" p<rest of post truncated>\n",

      "For second service we can use group buy! The minimum price is 0,7819btc/5 GH.Add Terms: 1. Total hashrate, wich you have purchased, may be changed, if Metabank will change the price to order.For example. You purchased a 1 share at price 0,7819btc/5 GH, but Metabank will change the price to 20 btc. That is why your total speed will decrease to (18,7826/20)*5 = 4,7 GH. And in total We will have to find another buyers for 7,5 GH. Similarly, if the price decrease, your hashrate will increase.2. If you want, we can use John K as escrow. When we collect the full amount of the money, John K sent BTC to the Metabanks address.3. Payments, in proportion to your shares, every three days, when we get the device.4. Of course, If we can not find the right number of buyers for ASIC, i (or John K) will return the BTC in full5. You can reserve some shares for up to 5 days6.

      "Everyone using Braiins OS+ is limiting the power. There is no speed control, only power limit control. You tell the miner how many watts to use, and the autotuner does the rest.It works perfectly fine with supported miners. The S9SE is not supported as you have already been told, it is a different machine that has nothing to do with the S9, its closer to the S11 which is also unpopular.Also, Braiins OS+ is not modded firmware, its built from scratch, so there is no way to compare it.

      "The hash rate does not really allow for solo mining at both the current difficulty and the difficulty that'll probably be the case once they are delivered.I think a pool and two fallback pools would suffice. I believe it would be best to have pools where you can publicly view hashrate and hashrate over time. The only one that has that that I know of is Eligius, but I suppose waldohoover might prefer to have them as part of Mining Team Reddit on BTCGuild. Alternatively, you could use any pool and then use a webinterface for viewing hashrate, supposing such a thing exists for the mining client KnCMiner's machines will support (I know it does for cgminer, it ships with miner.php)\n",

      "Quick question about one of my rigs (3rd one). Seem to have stopped working as of this morning. It seemed to have froze a few times when CGminer started. Which isn't out of the ordinary, It has happened before and a quick change in config values seemed to always fix it. I generally view it through TeamViewer, so after a reboot, I logged into teamviewer before CGminer had a chance to start. I changed some config values (values that are well below anything considered a harmful speed) and tried booting CGminer back up. Again, it froze almost immediately. Another reboot and I noticed it wasn't logging into teamviewer, so I decided to go to the rig and throw it up on the montior without the remote login. Well unfortunately, the monitor wasn't picking up on anything. Testing the monitor on my other rigs shows the monitor is in perfect working condition, so I have no idea what's wrong with it.I've had issues before with miners. Blue Screens, Freezing, Crashes, nothing of which seemed to have any permanent damage, and no matter what issue I had in the past, a reboot and monitor connected always picked up a feed.

Not this either, but have encountered this in the past.The problem does seem to \"scale\" with the number of units I have connected. One or two units is no problem. Now with 16 units cpu usage hovers around 60%.BFGminer also shows this behavior on my beaglebone black running Minera.Even tried CGminer. All of the units show up and hash but at about 25% of their normal rate. This seems to be a bug in firmware 1.4.5. My other unitswith older firmware don't do this. They have 1.4.2 and 1.4.3 and work great with CGminer.

      "So this question is for the hardware/psu gurus. I'm powering a Neptune heater in my house with server PSUs that don't have native 5v output. I'm using this to step 12v down to 5v to power the KNC controller. I ordered it a little quickly, and didn't notice that in its specifications ripple is listed as 200mv which is insanely high compared to ATX specifications of 50mv max on the 5v rail. My question is, how dangerous for the controller is this? Am I looking at imminent death? How would I go about smoothing out the ripple to acceptable levels? I do have server PSUs with native 5v output, but they're less convenient for in house use. I guess I should possibly just use one of them with a single cube to take advantage of it's clean 5v output.\n",

      "You could use an electrolytic capacitor across the 5V +/- output. These capacitors are polarized, so the capacitor + Plus goes with the + power supply output and negative - goes with the negative of the capacitor.<link> sells for about $5. It's rated at 35V so you are safely over the 5V working voltage.If the ripple is still to high, just add another capacitor in parallel. If they are out of stock of this value, just buy the highest value 35V electrolytic capacitor.For super duper anal retentiveness, add a 5 or 10 microfarad tantalum electrolytic in parallel to damp down higher frequency <truncated> do all this stuff with the power off! Tape or cover up all exposed wires.Future enhancements if you have power glitches: This would take some more electronics knowledge, but you could think about using a super capacitor that can safely handle 5V DC.

      "### Original post:\n",
      "Not sure if this has been asked before (I'm new on here, sorry). But my miners are gathering a lot of dust inside. Does it matter? Do you guys vacuum them, is it safe to do that? If you do, how often do you clean them?Thanks!\n",
      "\n",
      "### Reply 1:\n",
      "You could vaccum it, but it would be better to get some compressed air and blast it, and then vaccum it.You should do so since dust prevents the miner from releasing the heat, and it may cause it to overheat and lower the hashrate.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Reply 2:\n",
      "If you get alot of dust on fan and airway no it's not good. As suggested best is a can of air spray it out. If you are able to open case and spray out is best. With this you can spray out side and not have a lot of dust going through machine.\n",

How can I start earning bitcoins? I am a beginner in this chapter, I only know what a bitcoin is and what it is worth. Can you explain me please how should I start?(Maybe give a link to a good, practical tutorial).Thank you very much!\n",

      "### Reply 1:\n",
      "If your friend said he was going to build a PC to mine coins, he's not very knowledgeable about mining.Mining nowadays require task specific hardware (in other words an ASIC). Profitable hardware can cost you around 1000$ to start (low-end).Expecting a 2500$ (1BTC) return after 2-3 months after a 25$ investment is unrealistic. To be honest, you'll likely not even get a single dollar back with this little starting capital.Altcoins (you mentionned Terracoin) are even less stable than Bitcoin, meaning they won't hold their value for very long, increasing the risk of your operation. Although, this has the upside of having a better potential reward.\n",

All asic miners have one to run the mining software (aka \"control\" board), they are ARM based, but i assume sooner or later they will switch to RISC-V like you did.

      "Don't start a mining farm in 'Noo Yawk'. If you make a profit, they have a ridiculous income tax. They charge a ridiculous sales tax too. The power rate is much higher than 3-4 cents unless you sign a deal directly with a power plant. The publicly available rate at 1 MW is probably 5-6 cents in the west/central load zone. The state as a whole is unfriendly to the crypto industry. The only advantage will be the low temperature.I recommend finding a state which isn't a stereotypical mining state like WA/TX/NY, browsing through the utility tariff documents, and hopefully finding a place that offers ~5 cents without having too much competition from other miners. Don't choose a location which is too hot, like southern/west TX, AZ or NM. I've heard of a large farm located in NJ moving to OH this month, so you might want to consider that state as the weather is cooler.I can also give you a list of states where you can't find power for < 6 cents anywhere in the state: CA, NJ, FL, CT, MA, RI, PA, DE, MD, VA.

      "Hi I recently acquired another S3 and having power issues. I'm having a difficult time maintaining the appropriate power consumption levels to allow all miners to run without turning one or more off during certain times of the day - when appliances in my household are utilized at peak hours. To avoid tripping the breaker - I usually shut one or two off and fire them back up and I don't like doing that because it is probably not good for the machines. I don't know any settings in the Antminer to configure a time schedule. But the main point is - when the power goes out - I lose payment for that day from my mining pool site (not sure if all mining pools are like this) will not pay out if my machines go offline (before the block finished) their reply was :\"You will not get a payment in case your machine was down before the block finished. \"So how do I get paid off this mining pool site if I need to turn them off from 6-9. For example. Leave one running ?Do all miners work together, or on individual blocks ? I guess that's the question I'm trying to get at.thanks,vp00009\n",

Was not pleased. Yes, I had 2 outages a day in those 4 days lasting less than a minute - but I mean that's just silly - and they were not garbage shifts either.

Also go to the Tests tab and click Create Debug Report, and include that in the email as well.If there was a problem with profiles loading, check the ProfilesDataPath setting in CGWatcher.exe.ini and make sure it is pointing to the correct location. There were issues with this that were fixed in 1.3.1, but if the setting was set incorrectly by a previous version you'll have to either manually correct it or delete CGWatcher.exe.ini to have a new one generated when you start CGWatcher. This is also true of the VariablesDataPath setting in the ini file, which works the same way and had the same issue from previous versions.Also don't use folders on the desktop to store CGWatcher or the miner folder, as Windows treats the desktop a little differently than normal folders and permission issues seem to creep up.

      "We live just outside of town. We are literally one of the last houses to get an internet signal from a land line. Any further and it would have to come by satellite. Our service is slow and it will cut out at times. What will happen when we lose internet signal while mining? Will it start again when the signal returns?\n",

      "Maybe I die? Hahaha just bother ,Of course I can find a way to surf again or go out to find a strong signal or just go ahead and do not just lose the internet. There are many ways to get it back. One of my Life is the Internet and of course I will definitely make a way for it. It has to be acknowledged that it greatly helps everyone who lives in technology. Just like Bitcoin,I know that it can be a great help someday\n",

      "That depends on your miner. We would need a bit more info than you provided to give a solid answer. Miners *should* for the most part sit there and keep trying until it gets a connection but I know some miners after too many timeouts just go into an idle mode.\n",

If the reboot process took a lot longer, that sounds like a pain in the ass. Unless this process actually guaranteed a good boot from that board. I am skeptical though.

      "### Original post:\n",
      "As many of you know I managed to make a working adapter-board to convert S1 controller work with S3 blades.I have now drawn PCB for it and actually ordered a little batch of these boards made by factory.Many of you can make your own adapter with information given in this thread: <link> I wonder if there is anyone interested in ready made boards?And if so, do you want just plain PCB or whole board fully populated and with connectors? I'm asking this because I'll order connectors and regulators more if needed.Pictures here are of my home-made PCB but factory-made will be double sided.So there are no jumper wires.But lay-out of the board is pretty much the same as in pics here.Adapter board: I'll have PCB's after 2-3 weeks and so there is still time to think this.Connectors come from Germany in a couple of days if needed.Here is schematic for those who haven't seen it (I think that I removed link to the original picture because I thought that there was an error -there wasn't).I have made several prototypes and they work pretty well.I've kept that blade hashing for three days with no problems.I'd be glad to hear opinions about this project.\n",

      "About pricing: All depends on quantities and shipping.Connectors are biggest cost (5.12 +shipping/board) if I buy them,let's say,10-30 boards.I can buy quantity of 200 connector (100 boards) and price would be about 1/board. But I doubt that I would never sell more than 10 to 20 boards.And shipping from Finland is expensive.I think it will be just under 5 economy shipped.Then add another 5 for the rest of the parts including heat sink.Then it's close 15 for one board and that doesn't even include my expences (shipping costs,PCBs).So I think I'll ask 20 per board fully populated and tested.It won't give me profit but I should't lose either (except my time).About controlling more than two boards: Yes that is my goal.As a matter of fact,I have one that controls four blades.But it's more complex since level-shifting is done with IC.It is also possible to do with additional components (and cheaper) but then drawing PCB would be much more difficult for me.I spent 3 nights drawing this! And there are only few components and connectors.If some-one with better capabilities could help with drawing PCB,I'd be happy to give schematics. Everything could be done better (adding step-down for 12V <rest of post truncated>\n",

      "I suppose it'd have to be one step at a time then .... when you get these off the PCB press then that would be a good time to go bigger (and count me in those interested ..). With regard to drawing / preparing the schematics, I am not expert either (electronics et al!) but using Eagle I've done a few in my time for personal use, as I am sure most people have.Saying that, your price point, if you can pull it off for the dual blade controller, is a good one.\n",

      "### Reply 8:\n",
      "Well that price is for adapter-board driving one controller and two blades,if that's what you mean.Adapter that can handle two S1 ctrl-boards and four blades total,would need special cables.It's no problem if you can source cheap wires with right crimps (they cost 0.61 each where I buy connectors from so wires for one miner would total 24.40 without connector housings).Crimping 80 crimps for one miner is a job that I don't wanna do.I can if I have to,but it's one whole day job.I use wires pulled out of LG tv-sets.Different connectors but same crimps.I also bought some 20 pin connector housings.So these special adapters are maybe better to be just homemade stuff.\n",

      "nice price I'll pay 30 to 35 US a board i expected it to be more . but then again bitmain wants all most 80 or more + shipping for a S3 controller so this will be well worth it .but your price 22.36 US about is really good , I'm willing to go up to 35 US shipping would be another 10 to 15 US ? .\n",

      "Does it look like the s11 bmminer is keep restarting? Check the dashboard overview the version of bmminer is not showing. There are 2 possible reasons why it's not showing the first one may be the miner is not connecting on the internet there is something connection error or blocking your miner to connect online sometimes changing DNS solves my issue. I also like to suggest you replace the Ethernet cable you might have a defective ethernet cable.2nd one is you have corrupted bmminer program or something wrong about the firmware that gives you no BMminer version in the dashboard you can also see this in kernel logs that BMminer is restarting. I suggest you don't touch anything about your miner for now because it is still under warranty so sending it back to the manufacturer is the best solution.\n",

      "No, you can't downgrade them 2019 firmware has signature restriction you can't downgrade them just like in s9.

      "Given the fact that a huge portion of these mining gears are sold to newbies who abuse the use of SSH by over clocking their gears and doing things they don't understand, it has probably created a lot of work load on their support team, let alone the numbers of gears which are under warranty and they have to fix/replace because people want to hash at 50% or 100% more than the default hashrate.I was upset when I first updated my miners to the latest firmware , but then one member here (forgot who was , but credit goes to him) pointed out a similar point to what I have mentioned above, and after giving it a second thought, I can't seem to blame them for it.anyway way if you have a lot of gears and you really need SSH access, i saw a trusted guy on Telegram selling a a plug and play PI with a script that should unlock all your gears over night, you basically just have to plug it into your network and go to bed, later on you have full SSH access to all your gears, can't remember how much he sells it for, but i think Taserz or Scott would know because they are more active on telegram than I am , and if anyone is interested I can ask for them or invite them to the Telegram group.\n",

I hope to get the 2x T-110s miners working again by using parts from the 5x T-110 miners. If I can also get one or two T-110 miners also working that would be a bonus. I know I have at least 6 working power supplies, and also 6 cubieboards working, and from the hashing I see when I can get some of them to power up, I think I have at least 10 Hashfast modules that should work.Also if anyone has had any success recovering or underclocking the Hashfast boards, using the Hashfast Characterization Monitor (HCM) on the cubian OS installed with these miners, I'd be happy to learn from their experience.Any pointers or suggestions would be appreciated.\n",

      "Hello, last month I bought to electric-tech on eBay for $190 a BitCrane T110 which had both watercooling dead. I replace them with \"Cooler Master Nepton 120XL\" which are compatible with \"Coolit\". I replaced the thermal compound with \"Thermal grizzly Conductonaut\" after having insulated the components around the chip with Neutral Silicon compound. With the frequency set to 725 on <truncated> the T110 run above 1,1 TH/s with the temperature arount 73C. Then I replaced the noisy fan with the Cooler Master low noise ones and reduced the frequency to 500 Mhz. Now it run by not making more noise than a PC and gives between 900 GH/s to 1010 GH/s at 77C which is not bad.OK now there are Avalon 841 which gives 13 TH/s and some other which gives up to 18 TH/s but there are also as noisy as Fireman Siren.I think you can get some money by putting them on eBay. There are certainly still a few people who would be delighted to buy them.Best Regards and good mining !machproo\n",

For homes with split-phase it is the lines across the Neutral tap/split or phase-to-phase for 3-phase. The N designation on a PSU input is does not apply - it goes to a phase.

      "### Original post:\n",
      "Guys,Have a couple of S9s on the way - plan on putting them in a mineral oil bath and then trying to harness the waste heat to heat our hot water for the house through a heat exchanger.I plan on using BraiinsOS (paid version).My plan on the oil bath is to us a gear pump to move the oil around - inject it into the \"in\" side of the miners and suck out the hot oil from the top of the tank - my question isIs there an advantage to leaving the fans on and have them running slowly to move the oil through the units - or am i better off just removing them entirely.My goal is to run the Oil bath at around 50c or soCraig\n",
      "\n",
      "### Reply 1:\n",
      "Since you have pump to move the mineral oil it's fine with or without fans.I believe that leaving it there would help a little bit to cool down your miner but it consumes power. So it depends on you if you want efficiency.I don't know if you could run it at 50c but as Bitmain normal ranges it should around 65c to 115c since you are using Braiins and not their stock firmware it would be fine.\n",

      "### Reply 3:\n",
      "You will need a pump to handle the oil flow, these fans won't do any good when put under oil, and will eventually if not instantly die, you either get some fan simulators or use custom firmware that allows you to disable the fan check phase altogether.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Reply 4:\n",
      "Thanks guys for all the replies.As i will be using Braiins OS it does allow me to disable the fan check so i will just leave the fans in place at this stage.The Pump is plan on using a Mallory 5250 Gerotor pump - it will move 250 US Gallons per hour - as it is a 12v DC pump i will be able to control the speed of the pump to keep the oil at the optimum temperature for the rigs.Craig\n",

      "### Original post:\n",
      "Hello there. Im running a 741 I bought used off ebay, and ran it for a few months, since mid December 2021. Fan got busted, was replaced with another one one month later, not exactly the original and started to reboot when weather was too hot. I wasnt aware of the log (newbie), but while I was working in the research, the right (second) PMU board lighted red LED and stopped working. I disassembled the whole thing, and took both the hashing board and the PMU to a technician. He identified a 6 pins integrated circuit in the PMU as the possible failure. Anyone could please led me to a place to buy this part? Im in Venezuela, but have a US post address and can receive shipping no problem. This machines are one of my income means, hence my nick \"survivor\". I would greatly appreciate any help. There are some local companies that will fix parts like boards but I do prefer (our weather in the range of 23C-32/34Cis a little bit hot to do some overclocking unless you use liquid cooling) to get a new part to keep the device running as long as possible.Look forward to hear from you!\n",

      "Yeah, all those miners who have poured millions into data centers and gear are just so stupid and they haven't figured out how cheap solar energy is, they need some random dude on a forum to tell them so.An S19 burns 72kwh a day, in a scenario in which you get 6 hours of peak sun, remember just because it's sunny outside doesn't mean the panels are producing at full capacity, so you need 15 kWh of solar panels to be safe and 40kwh in batteries equivalent and this is to keep you safe only for one day.Now google a 10kw solar panel system and tell me how \"cheap\" that is!Anyhow, mining revenue per raw th is still 20% higher than at the start of the year, including that is the picture of dropping energy rates all over the world and it stops beings such an apocalyptic future. Remember that at the start of the year, the revenue was almost half of what is now so if miners have survived that they will survive a having even with just a 25% increase in price.\n",

      "Indeed, solar energy is not a good 24/7 solution for anyone except those on grid that can over-produce and thus provide the rest of the grid extra power during the day, to cover their grid usage for the 66-75% of the time they can't use solar power.Energy storage is, to be blunt, in it's infancy, and anyone trying to store 100's of kilowatts or megawatts will have already learned the hard way how problematic, with current technology, that is.A real sustainable solar coin network would be one where miners only mine during the day when they have solar energy.Having world wide involvement would of course mean the network itself would work 24/7 without major issue, though the difficulty management would need to be timezone-hours controlled to ensure continuous transaction throughput rates.The main problem with this is that the big time miners are cheap, poorly designed junk.They can't handle regular power cycling and don't have power-up and power-down management at all.Considering how much power they use, this is ridiculous.(though wattsminers seem to do something akin to power-up handling by accident, with their default slow tuning when you turn them on)\n",

      "Solar electricity is very good for large cities, because with the help of solar panels you can not consume the energy of the power supply plant during the day, and run the turbines only in the evening, night and morning. And this justifies itself in countries such as India or China. Home miners use electricity at night when it is 30-40% cheap.\n",

      "### Original post:\n",
      "Whenever I use aticonfig to set clocks (aticonfig allows me to set clocks beyond BIOS limits), one of my cards is always stuck in a lower power state profile for some reason.For example, if I have a bunch of 5970s, I can set all the GPU clocks to 800,300. I fire up an instance of phoenix on each GPU and it will report 350~360 mhash per GPU except for 1 GPU which will be hovering between 240 and 360 because its clocks keep dropping down to 500mhz. I know this isn't a temperature issue because all the cards are at the same temps.The most obvious sign that this is a profile problem is probably the fact that this can be rectified by setting all the profiles to the same clock values in AMDOverdriveCtrl. But for reasons discussed in the first paragraph I prefer to use aticonfig. Does anyone have any idea what I can do?Many thanks in advance.\n",

      "### Original post:\n",
      "Any experience moving ASICs from one row to another?The new location will lower the temperature of any miner that's moved there. Not massively, but there will be a difference. I don't wanna just turn them off and leave them in situ because there are other machines still on in that lane. The miners in question would no longer benefit from being cooled by their own fans if they're off. They'd likely heat up. So that's not an option. With that being the case, any suggestions on the best way to move them?I could stop them hashing for X amount of time so the internal temperature drops? Then power them off, move to the new location, and restart.Or power down, move, cool for X amount of time, and restart?Or simply power down, move, and instantly restart?The move isn't far. But I'm aware of machines that have seemingly failed when relocated. So, just wondering if there's anything tried and tested? Anything you'd recommend?Thanks.\n",

      "I am using version \"LEDE Reboot 17.01.4 r3560-79f57e422d / LuCI bos+/stable-21.04 branch <truncated> on an SD card for a couple of S9's.The fans constantly hunt up and down at least +/- 80 rpm, changing speed about every 6 or so seconds. Chip temperature is 80C and varies +/- 0.15C. Although the S9's are in a location with noise abatement, it's the sounds of the varying fan speed that's annoying. If the speed was more constant (which happens with other S9 software) the sound would be much more tolerable.Seems to me that there should be more dead band in the control loop. We know power draw and therefore heat varies constantly as hash rates change every second. So trying to chase the temperature with varying fan speed is pretty fruitless.Are the temperature loop tuning parameters exposed in any way so that I can adjust them?\n",

      "### Original post:\n",
      "HeyI saw many posts around here were people would to know more about a solo mining SHA 256 lottery.I did mine with 2 Gekkoscience Newpac2, a old thinkpad which is running a StorJ node with a 10TO HDD. The CPU solo mine Monero XMR. You will need a powered usb hub to overclock your gekkoscience newpac. I put two cheap fans which I had to increase the overclock possibility.You can use that with a Raspberry Pi 2-3-4. It failed with my Zero W. I use the thinkpad because the STORJ node host on it cover easily all the costs. I personally think that this lottery could really be a waste of time and electricity, probabilities are quite near to 0 to solve a block. But in my situation I have already this laptop h24 running because of the node, so I prefer have this \"Lottery Ticket\" here. If I'll solve a block I would be pretty happy lolI run this lottery on solo ck pool. You will find a list of solo pools at the bottom of this post. You can use these USB sticks with any coin based on SHA256 algo : btc bch dgb etc...etc....How to setup that 1.

You remind me of this guy on Youtube who's always posting videos about using a RPi for crypto-related stuff. What you're doing is probably a waste of time, but man....I really love those USB stick miners, even in 2021. I just wish I'd gotten into bitcoin in the early days when you could still mine profitably with a few of those. And it's weird that the prices of Gekkoscience miners and Moonlanders have shot up in the past year or so. I'm not sure if they're becoming collectibles or if people are actually using them to do what you're doing (lottery mining).Anyway, the chances are against it but I wish you good luck finding a block.\n",

      "Topic: Is it possible to solo mine a whole block solely on insane luck?\n",
      "### Original post:\n",
      "Hey everyone,This question might sound dumb, but as I am not so savvy with the technicals of how mining works, I just have one question:As far as I know, blocks are mined based on \"bruteforcing\" the hash or something along those lines for the block headers... and the more mining power, the harder the hash gets (difficulty increases). When the first person gets the correct hash, or gets the luckiest so to speak, they get the reward and the block is confirmed. Today, as the hashrate increases, large mining pools get larger and the difficulty gets too competitive for solo miners, it becomes impossible for a solo miner to get any rewards (unless you join a pool of course)If someone were to join the mempool completely solo, and attempt to mine a block (let's say they have insane, basically impossible luck in bruteforcing the hashes) is it technically possible for them from a theoretical standpoint to fully mine a block and get the 6 bitcoin reward all for himself? If I completely have the wrong idea on how this works, let me know and ill delete the post. Thanks, Alec\n",

      "There is no 'fully mine a block', each hash is random and each hash has a specific probability of finding a block.It's purely random luck statistics for every single block mined.Same as rolling a dice - how often you roll the dice determines how often you 'expect' to get a 6.But anyone can roll a 6 on the first try (1 in 6 chance)Just with bitcoin the numbers are ridiculously much larger.Firstly, the dice has 2^256 sides (~10^77 or getting close to the number of atoms in the universe)There's also a number of the sides that count as a block (currently a little more than 8^19 or 9.0x10^22)So it boils down to probability, not 'yes or no'.So e.g. a 90TH/s miner currently has an approximately 1 in 11625 chance of finding a block in a full day of mining.So that leads to: 9TH/s is 1 in 116250 ... etc.However, don't extrapolate these numbers into the future, coz the probability changes every 2016 blocks mined.\n",

      "That's true, but I get what he means, and maybe OP is new to the game.People are trying to do what OP suggests with USB stick miners, aka \"lottery mining\". There's no harm in doing it, but you'd be better off playing Lotto every week, and I'm pretty sure the chances of mining a block with an ASIC in your home are still very remote. IMO it's far better to join a pool and at least earn something rather than be disappointed constantly by earning absolutely nothing--all while using up electricity at your own expense.But good luck, OP. Solo or pool mining bitcoin can be fun, but it's just not profitable for individuals these days.\n",

      "I thought I'd mentioned in this thread about how much USB miners were going for on eBay, but I guess it was another one.Nevertheless, I visited Bitcoinmerch today just for the hell of it, and they're selling the Gekkoscience NEWPAC miners at $79.99 a pop, and they're currently out of stock. I'm not even sure Gekkoscience even still makes these--I thought not, but there's no indication on the Bitcoinmerch website that these miners are used or anything.I found this blurb in the description kind of amusing:I don't know about the \"tweaking and testing\" but in 2021 these are lousy devices to \"get into mining\" and as far as spending a lot of money/burning power, that may be true but overall they're just a waste of money unless you're buying them as collectibles (or lottery mining, as OP is doing). I still love the history behind these and wish I'd been aware of bitcoin back when you could use a USB miner to mine enough bitcoin to break even and then hopefully make a profit. Anyway, just thought I'd share that and this thread is as good as any other to do it in I guess.\n",

      "Well this area of the website is restricted to only btc mining.however the sha 256 algorithm has other coins with far less difficulty.quick easy mathBtc is 36000 a coinmystery coin 1 is 600 a coin it is about 60x easier to hit a block. still hard to do with a usb stick.mystery coin 2 is 120 a coin it is about 300x easier to hit a block. still hard to do with a usb stickmystery coin 3 is 20 a coin it is about 1800x easier to hit a block. still hard to do with a usb stickSo you would learn all of the above suck to hit a block.You would also learn that none of the above are easy to roi.buying a used modded s9 with 2 boards and brains+ software is more pratcial .It likely will not turn a profit. but it can do 5th at 400 wattsvs the stick which does 0.050 th at 25 watts since you need to run a rasp pi or some kin<rest of thread truncated>\n",

Maybe the chain 1 can't run at the higher power that is why it's not showing and getting zero chips from awesomeminer.How about revert it back to the original firmware and test it with low power mode instead? A quick test will tell us if the middle hashboard is totally dead or if it can still run at low power mode.In case you don't know where you can find the low power mode you can find it under Miner's Configuration tab on the WebGUI.\n",

      "Interesting, what model did you get? Did you even talk to your distributor or Canaan about it?I and many others have the exact opposite results. I *used* to run BM gear and up to the s4 they were great, come s5 on up lots of issues culminating with all 4 T9's and 15 S9's I had each losing multiple boards. Initially repair service from Bitmain and then through Denver-based BitmainWarrenty was decent but quickly went to hell in a hand basket.Switched to Avalons starting with the A721 and have not looked back. Currently running just over 500TH of Avalons ranging from A841's to the A1047's and aside from losing 2 fans on my oldest and now retired 721's ZERO problems.You will find that the few folks here who did report problems were taken care of quickly and in a professional manner either by the distributor or Canaan directly. The miners are modular and easy to troubleshoot, find the problem and Canaan will get replacement parts right out to you.\n",

Some things you say are completely untrue.Calling me a troll and a hire, seriously. Getting posts deleted and stuff. Ehh?! It seem to be yourself that is biased if anyone. The long lead.time is absolutely true as I inquired about buying their new model and they recommended me to order already 3 months in advance. I do keep an open mind about the A1066 and look forward to hear how people experience this machine.\n",

They had outages only when my whole farm was turned down for cleaning and maintenance .Show me real evidence you had constant down time on your 1 now 2 units. Or leave the thread alone.

      "Hey guys, I have a bunch of S9's with security firmware that we are trying to load with another firmware, but unfortunately we've found most of these machines to not have the SD chip that allows flashing (see picture below). My question is how do I flash this thing if I can't SSH, load through the web UI, or flash via SD?<link>\n",

      "Well first you need to find a way to restore SSH access, one of the methods i know involves downgrading to the earlier firmware from 2019 (may?) from Bitmain, and then executing one of the exploits involving the html server. Once you restore SSH, you can proceed to liberate your miner.I know you can install the Free and Open Source Software Braiins OS using this method (using a simple python script). For other firmware it depends.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Reply 3:\n",
      "It won't work, that missing IC is responsible for the flash, regardless of the control board.Op depending on the Firmware version you have, unlocking SSH access might be very easy to do, Asic.to has a nice tool for that > <link> and you can unlock all miners at once.Once you unlock SSH and remove the signature, you should be able to install any firmware you want.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Reply 4:\n",
      "To flash it through the SD card you will need to download the t9+ program recovery from Bitmain. You will get the SD card program recovery from here \"T9+ Program recovery\". You don't need SSH access to make it work what you need is to move the JP4 jumper to the right position to make it work.The whole procedure how to flash it through SD card can be found here \"S9 series (S9, S9i, S9j, S9 Hydro) Control Board Program Recovery\".With or without SD card IC/Chip it should be work except for the c5 control board. So Sd card flashing should be work but if it's not working you will need the USB to serial converter to connect directly to the control board. You can follow the guide from here \"Rescuing a bricked T9 (and S9?) Control Board - HOWTO.\n",

      "### Reply 5:\n",
      "If it will not work why the sd card slot is there? What is the purpose of having an sd card slot on the S9 control board if it won't work?There is an s9 miner made without an SD card like the CRT0301 model so that the one does not have IC behind the SD card slot should be work.I'm just comparing them on Mobile clones that don't have IC behind the SD card slot but still, it's working fine.Why not, let's wait for him to test to verify since the line of the SD card slot is on both sides and maybe the missing IC is not for SD card.\n",

      "This one of so many things that bitmain does for no logical reason, i am on the same page with you here, you put an Sdcard slot for what?? But with that missing IC it won't work, the same thing happened to someone else before, with a bit of digging you will find it i guess.With that being said, he should try a few times with different sdcards, chances are slim but worth it, if it doesn't work, he has to work around it by following the other possible ideas presented here\n",
