      "Hi AllI have a few modular/semi modular PC psu's and was thinking of using the to pwer some S9 miners with 2 cards. Most of what i have are 1000w or higher.They will be worthless selling so might be better put to use on some S9s powered with2 cards, so i would need x7 ouputs all together.I think i could use an existing hard wired PCIE (6 pin or not) to power the control board.Then on the dedicated high amp PCIE modular ouputs could i not solder on connections and 'share' the load so x2 on each output?I have only seen x8 to x2 PCIE cables so could i not just splice in and solder another?If this works i could do a few more miers in thsi set up as it would be low power and quite when set to 700/800w.Anyone done this or got an opinion on it?The PSU's will either go to waste tbh.Pics attached.<link>\n",

      "To be honest, modular plug PSU's all have 1 major problem: They are pushing the maximum current rating through the contacts and generally have only 18ga wires between the PSU and PCIe plugs.Ok, that's 2 major problems...That said, since you are talking about running at reduced power it may not be an issue, just periodically check to see how warm the PSU connectors get. Yes, I've had a few rather spectacularly fry over the years from when I used them to power s3's & s5's...Other thing to keep in mind is that particular PSU has 2 independent output rails. DO NOT connect power from the 2 different rails to 1 hash board! They will be shorted together and fight each other.\n",

      "Ahh, thanks guys I actually was exporting the DISPLAY variable in my mining startup script but I'd stupidly disabled this while installing/testing the card. That seems to have solved that problem! Unfortunately this led me on to a new issue: The Xubuntu computer loses power very quickly when I start mining on the 5970 with anything above intensity 1, but it mines fine (intensity 11) when installed in a different windows machine...When the linux comp powers off, it's without warning I have to wait a little and toggle the PSU switch before turning it on again. Both PC's have adequate PSU's (760W) and the 5790 is the only card being used. So it has me puzzled. Why would mining cause the linux machine to quickly shut off? Temps on the fan never get a chance to hit 80 before the power cuts off.I will start a new thread on this if it comes to me getting completely stuck (I can try a 7870 in the linux computer and see if it has the same problem), but I hoped someone may have a good idea why this is happening? ATI drivers are 11.11Thank you very much for ideas on this one and happy hashing!\n",

      "I've been mining with two USB Block Erupter Sapphires without issue for at least a week now, properly cooled. Today, I've been messing around with things trying to get my Antminer U2 up and running and must've done something that now causes one of my erupters to show up under Device Manager as a usb device instead of under \"Ports\". When I try to mine with it, it just sits in standby doing nothing. However, if I plug it into my Win 7 machine it comes up normally under \"Ports\" instead of \"Universal Serial Bus Devices\" but I don't have an ethernet to that box to test if it will mine. I'm not sure what exactly is going on with this stick. Is it fried?\n",

      "The private-key is inside your Ledger. Putting in a simple way, MEW uses your public key (address) to see your balance and build the transaction, which its sent to the Ledger device, signed with the private-key and sent back to the computer, where its broadcasted. The private-key never leaves the device (reason why you can't see them, and why hardware wallets are so secure compared to normal desktop wallets).\n",

If the image was installed properly, and your controller isn't broken, it should be working. Make sure you don't have anything preventing javascript from running on that page.The \"ant_data=;\" you see in the miner configuration page is there because the header has an inline script that begins with Code:echo \"ant_data = ${ant_result};\" The script is fetching cgi data from the config saved in <truncated> For some reason it is failing at that point.\n",

      "### Original post:\n",
      "Innosilicon is offering \"manufacturer refurbished\" T3+ and other miners. I ordered a T3+ 57T Bitcoin miner. I had to wait for 4 weeks after I paid in full in Bitcoin until they shipped it out. When it arrived it was in horrible condition: <link> of dust, with scratches, stains, missing screws, rattling parts, rust...The firmware was locked and I was not able to enter my own pool settings. There was plenty of evidence that this miner was not manufacturer refurbished, not even cleaned. Otherwise at least the firmware would have been reset. Innosilicon has 3 departments: while the support is trying to help to unlock the miner, the sales and order team tells me: \"This is what you get when you order from us. Deal with it!\"\n",

      "Yeah, they use the term refurbished for a miner that was damaged and repaired by them or something returned and they've set it back running. They did warn a bit but you didn't take the warning seriously, usually in those cases light scratches mean run over by an excavator:Sucks and if I were in your place, even if support manages to help you unblock the settings I would play possum and try to get a refund and send it back. I won't be surprised if that thing wouldn't break in a few months, external scratched and missing screws ain't a big deal but you should take a look inside if possible and have a beer nearby when you do\n",

      "### Reply 5:\n",
      "Refurbished miners could be a great bargain if you get a diamond in the rough with no issues but that is playing a dangerous game if there is no warranty attached to them. Depending on the price and time to get to you it may pay itself off quickly but if it breaks it could quickly become a paperweight or something that ends u costing what a new unit would plus the downtime to ship it back for repairs. Would love to hear feedback as well from anyone who bought one.\n",

      "You are right with the firmware lock, but this is a straight-out scam if you ask me, these were supposed to be \"manufacturer refurbished\", the ones in the video don't look anything like it, in fact, REAL refurbished miners are a lot more expensive than clean used miners, a while back used S9js were going for $250 while the refurbished once were going for at least $400, but those looked as good as new, no scratches, no lost screws, everything seemed like brand new, the miner in the video is a Used Miner with C- condition, selling it as a refurbished piece is nothing but scam IMO.\n",

      "Figured they would carry some sort of limited warranty. That said, considering Inno was made aware of the Fixed Address issue on at least some miners and quickly responded by putting out a fix for it one can't fault them for their response on that part. They also said they were going to issue a mass email to all customers who bought one of the refurbed miners to notify of them of the possible problem and fix for it if they received a miner that was locked. Hopefully the OP just got a miner that had already been shipped just before Inno became aware of the problem and the miner had yet yet been updated to OEM firmwareMy take on things is that the miners are of course from some of the farms in China that got shut down. It makes sense that a farm would use locked firmware to make sure there is (near) zero chance of miners being hijacked either through hacking or actual theft. If stolen, as soon as the miner goes on line Inno will know which miner and what the ip address is.Biggest problem is Inno dropping the ball on making sure the miners are at least cleaned up and along with that definitely reset back<rest of thread truncated>\n",
