      "Has nobody overclocked or overvolted an S2 yet?640 chips (an S1 has 64 chips), 16 chips per TPS53355 regulator (S1 has 8 per)S1 was forcing around 30A through the regulator at stock speeds, and up to 40A with overclocking and some overvolting (based on some of the 210GH+ reports in this thread)S2 is putting about 22-24A on the regulator at stock. Presumably with a bit of voltage modding and overclocking the regulators could handle up to about 1.4TH/2kWonly issues:1) power. To seriously overclock, adding a 600W+ PSU will be necessary2) cooling. More fans and/or individual chip heatsinks are necessary to properly exhaust any extra heat since the units read 50C+ temperatures stock2b) PCI entenders. Looks like the boards are all mounted using PCI (PCIe 16x?) slots. if you used some risers (with a nice pair of 14AWG power cables to protect the risers) you could get the boards up out of the case and arrange them with airflow directly aimed at the heatsinks for better cooling.I can't wait for my batch 2 unit to arrive - if noone overclocks by then I might have to be the first.

Nice I am running about hour now and no HW errors at all.

Also setup some backup pools so that when Bitcoin-QT doesn't supply work fast enough you miner can leak some shares to standard pools. That way it's not a complete loss.Also the only share you will see submitted to the solo will be block solves. So not seeing any accepted shares is normal operation for solo mining.Sam\n",

      "### Original post:\n",
      "I had 2 chains showing before, but one of them had only xxxx for the ASIC status. I went ahead and rebooted the machine to see if it would resolve any issues. Initially, I had overclocked to 250M. I think that may have had an adverse affect. My PSU is 850W, so it should be plenty. Anything I can do to get that other chain back? Right now, I'm mining at HALF the rate I should be.Any thoughts or help?Thanks\n",

This will break the front warranty sticker, so you must get their permission. But at least you could keep mining at 9-ish GH while you wait for the board to be returned and replaced. The ant won't care if it comes up with only two boards, it will still mine them. But of course, power down before disconnecting anything or opening 'er up.Slushpool - nice!\n",

      "### Original post:\n",
      "Is that a bad thing? You can work that out by asking the following questions:1) When was the last time you heard of an S5 damaged in transit?2) When was the last time you heard of a Tube / Prisma damaged in transit? [A miner that used copious packaging].3) Do you like paying to ship unneeded packaging materials around the world?4) Do you want all the baby penguins to die?\n",

      "Yeah I think the s5 is normally shipped only with 2 white foam pieces.. well also with the bubble wrap bag but with these second hand units i can see why they dont include the bubble wrap.. probably just packaging them up on the fly really quick\n",
      "\n",
      "### Reply 2:\n",
      "That's up to the next buyer to decide. For me, personally the different units i have came in smaller/tigher boxes with the unit in an anti-static bag. Overall there's less packaging material. The sides are have a small layer of foam which serve arguable purpose beside balancing the pressure if the unit get thrown or dropped. Doesn't sound particularly overkill to me and it is better packaging and less material weight, while the extremities get the same absorption rate.Is that a bad thing? Probably not. Was the packaging i received very barebone? Yes. Would i have preferred a tighter and better packaging? Yes.Mhm. That is how it went. I do hope we get those coupons toward some other product down the road. It would make me fully satisfied, since ultimately i did pay full price for a slightly used unit, but used nontheless.\n",

      "Of the 5 I've gotten, that's how 4 of them showed up. One had peanuts and some antistatic foam and was in a plastic bag, but that one I bought via Amazon used not from Bitmain.The \"30 days starts when the units are shipped\" part is actually illegal under US law - US code specifies that warrenttees start when the buyer recieves the item (I've BEEN to court once over that and WON, it's in the US Code somewhere) but for practical purposes it's not a significant issue given that Bitmain seems to get stuff out promptly once they claim it's shipped - 2 to 3 day difference that most folks would never notice.Just be sure if you DO have a warenttee claim that you get it filed promptly - once the claim is FILED there in no specific time limit on resolution.I suspect the coupons aren't going to be particularly large amount. I'd bet on $50 or less - which is still better than nothing when they FINALLY start selling S7s.\n",

      "I won't spit on 50~$ and worse case scenario i can probably sell them to an user if i can't afford the next gen unit. Regardless. I look forward to it.I'm thinking of opening a ticket with Bitmain about the instability of board one. Overall its not a big hash loss but if its precursor to more severe issue, then that would really bother me ^_^\".If its a stable issue that wont degrade, i don't mind too much. Its a big hash rate loss when it happen, but in the last 3 days it only happened once. It would definitively be a loss to ship it back or something no matter what.Other than that, since my later tests that i didn't report, 393.75 is the best Freq. You can get 5 more GH~ at 400 but you start getting over <0.0001% errors and ultimately you get like 5 gh for 9watt~ of power.\n",

      "So two days ago, the Used Antminer S5 Batch 7 from Bitmain finally arrived. Me and several user were previously discussing the condition and value of buying used hardware for the full price. So this is for the few who asked question such as \"Second Hand S5, Is it worth?\" This will be a pseudo review on specifically the Used batch 7 Antminer S5 bought directly from Bitmain;So the packaged arrived in the usual box it always does. I quickly opened it and found some very minimal packaging. No need to include a picture, it was simply 2 white foam square holding the extremities, with no other kind of padding or packaging whatsoever.The unit was fairly dusty and there was clumps of dust in the heatsink. Hmm well, a bit of pressured air and as new. Or not quite, but i guess its not that bad.2 Minutes later i finished placing it, plugging it and logging into the interface and replacing the Bitmain's worker info with Kanopool. Then flashed to Bitmain's latest firmware.My first impression was Great, the open wrt Luci is very responsive (My S1 are hella slow).I then first tested a few things, the 2 most important point i must bring;-Fan control works, you set a %, no value seem to default to 8<<rest of thread truncated>\n",

      "The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes.The importance of the above quote struck me last night. So I want to throw in my .02 btc of being an honest node and add some hashing power. I'm not worried about spending a few more dollars on electricity than I make in bitcoins because Bitcoin has already treated me so well.I mined on my laptop back in the day but stopped when it went to GPUs. Now, looking at mining has the same effect on me as the first time I encountered Bitcoin itself. It's confusing for us non-miners. So perhaps an expert or two could help clear up the confusion.My question: What's the lowest impact, cheapest method of adding 1-2 gigahashes/s to the network? As said, this is just to be an honest node as I'm not worried about profit from mining.Thanks!\n",

      "The \"being an honest node\" argument with just 1-2GH/s is moot, because with such a low hashrate you're probably going to mine on a pool anyways. In that case it's not you, but the pool-operator who has to be honest (and you don't really have any control about that).But to answer your question: the cheapest way in terms of initial investment is probably to grab some used ATI GPUs on ebay, although the energy-cost is quite high for the long term. Another way would be to grab some used FPGA boards, higher initial investment, lower energy-costs. Or just wait a few more months and hope for ASICs to be <truncated> that's about all methods around for everybody.\n",

      "Surprised you didn't talk about the increase in available output running off 220v. That was a huge concern of mine when ordering my D3 was the incredibly high power draw requirements Bitmain stated (1200W). according to them, the APW3++ will deliver 1200W on 110v or 1600W on 220v. Knowing that it's NEVER a good idea to run a switching powersupply at or near full load, I opted to run all my PSUs off 220v for the additional overhead afforded to the PSU so it wouldn't run at or near full load thus increaseing longevity and reducing wear and tear on the units. This also allowed me to increase miner density per circuit as current draw is reduced by half due to the voltage increase. I've seen one video (I think it was Cryptocrane?) where they noted the ACTUAL miner draw was in the 900W range. I would LOVE to see verification of that by another channel. Considering you're the only other one making videos regularly of decent quality who has a D3, you're primed for that kind of testing.\n",

      "Just so you know, USB works on 5v, not 12v. If your USB hub's power brick is rated for 12 volts, it is because your USB hub has internal power circuitry that brings the 12v down to 5v. If you connect a 12v power source to a hub that does not have this circuitry, you will fry everything, including the USB port on your motherboard since the power 12v power will backlash into the 5v and ruin everything.

      "Same. Actually, I just got it to boot. Weirdly in my bios the CPU was undervolted by 0.3v. But the PC has been working fine for 2+ years (6450 is a recent addition). I had pulled out the 6450 and the eSATA pci-e card because of the hang on storport.sys but still could not get past the Windows boot up logo. The integrated graphics was also ATI/AMD so it would loud the same driver - I thought I was screwed. As a last resort I decided to reset the bios (this MB has always been finicky) and noticed the 0.3v undervolt! I wonder if this was usable before (can't remember) and just now at this point in time stopped working or somehow the bios got corrupted (seems so unlikely?).I'm reinstalling 11.7 now to see if the CPU voltage setting was the culprit.Anddd...the PC froze during setup.Reinstalled 11.7 again without display driver and got BSOD..and here's the kicker, my CPU is once again undervolted 0.3v in bios. So now I have some software that can change my bios settings O.O\n",

      "I don't have UEFI. I know it's possible to make real time changes to certain chipset flags but none that persist in the BIOS EEPROM. The undervolting may just be a quirk of the MB from all the hanging and BSODing...it's a weird MB. The system has otherwise been stable since I've put it together.I have tried installing 1. complete 11.7 package, 2. 11.7 without display driver, 3. 11.7 with just display driver, app sdk, and VISION engine. All 3 has same problem - I'm suspecting the VISION engine setup now so going to try it without that.Update: Confirmed the instability is from the VISION Engine. Maybe it doesn't have the correct clock profile for my 6450 and thus runs it at unstable settings. Don't have an explanation for the BIOS undervolting except that the MB is quirky.\n",

      "No kidding?!?! Is that another Yunhui PSU problem? Can you post the label of the PSU that is causing problems, and clarify whether it's one unit or several of those power supplies that are bad?The one I have is called YUNHUIBTC miner power supplyModel: G1057-1800WInput: 176-264VAC 50/60Hz 15A MaxOutput: 12V, 150A MaxI have only tested it for a short while. It seemed OK but yours sounds like the voltage is drooping or collapsing under load. I'm interested because I'm moving into a data center 2h away and I don't want these supplies to crap out as soon as I get halfway home, lol.If you have a voltmeter, I would check the voltage at the power supply's screw terminals as the miner ramps up. Use this miner that limps along, not the other miners that just hammer the supply and stop mining.There is a blue adjustment pot in mine, but messing with it could be dangerous if you don't have a voltmeter to make sure you are not exceeding the s9 spec.\n",

      "It turns out my cubes did not like being pointed at the same proxy. This morning I did some more testing and put them both back on single proxies (like I had been running) and that appears to have solved the hashing problems I was having. Doesn't make much sense to me given how fast a machine the single proxy was running on (dual quad core desktop). Putting a second proxy on an old slow dual core laptop seems to do the trick. I'm guessing my internal network or traffic could have something to do with it.One of the boards still is not hashing at full capacity so I'm going to start up a proxy on a 3rd machine and try point that cube at the new proxy.I did try the -nm option when I was running only 1 proxy and that didn't help (the work difficulty dropped to a 1 from around 22).=====Just started up a new proxy on a 3rd computer and pointed my slower cube at it and that seems to have resolved the problem. I'm not sure what is going on since prior to last night I was running both cubes through the same switch to two different proxies on two different machines.

      "Thanks for your interest! You can see more details about kit purchases at <link> tindie? It is like the etsy of hobby electronics, and is integrated with paypal to provide security for all parties. If you pledge to the campaign no funds will be withdrawn until the end of the campaign, and if I fail to ship you can easily claim refunds. As much as I want to accept BTC for payment right now it is not feasible. Using tindie will allow me to place component and board orders instantly upon funding, vastly reducing delivery wait time.\n",

      "Am I missing something, or is this really just a power button for an ATX Power supply and a Raspberry Pi? How much does it cost, and can you really justify it over something like this?<link> just did a random check, and it seems a bare Arduino board with no accessories runs $30. Add another $10 or so for the other components, and you effectively have a $40 power switch for your $50 Pi. I can see some value if you're making a sealed, plug-and-play miner that you will hand off to someone else (or sell on eBay at an insane markup), but I think for most folks, the breakout board above (or heck, a bent paperclip!) would be more cost effective.\n",

      "### Reply 21:\n",
      "Like I said, it has merit in specific use cases, but in general, it may not be cost-effective. If you can add some functionality to it beyond just a power button, it would be more viable. A couple of ideas come to mind. First, software integration with the Pi so that you could control multiple individual miners and power-cycle a stuck one, or turn on additional miners at set times, when power may be cheaper. Also, Crazyates mentioned auto-power-on; that got me thinking that it would be nice to automatically power on the system as soon as the power supply is plugged in, so that if power goes out in your area, you wouldn't have to do anything to start up your miners after power is restored.Side note, I went looking for a cheaper alternative to that breakout board ($9 each, plus about $10 to ship), and I found this item on eBay. Functional, but certainly not elegant. The guy sells them for $5.50 each, or five for $19, with free shipping in the US.\n",

      "they will hash forever and ever (or until some scam / hack / natural death / it ends). its not really much of a gamble, just a flat out loss versus mining yourself unless you factor in risks like your hardware breaking, house burning down, etc.There was never a point where they were willingly offering GH/s at a \"good deal\" price, one of the larger deals that is pure profit is obtaining the GH/s via referrals. The fact that they're able to monetize this points directly to botnet and/or they are clearly making a good profit on the upsell.In short, they're buying the same equipment you could buy (maybe at a bulk discount, maybe not) and selling it to you and making a profit on the service. As the generation % of 1gh/s changes, the value of it should go down but... randomly hasn't, etc.for example i will sell you a % of my GH/s for 1% more than the coins it generates are worth to be assessed and paid daily.

      "Hello there guys, I am totally new to the world of mining and I been reading a lot about how this miner I receive yesterday won't generate any revenue.I have never set up one of this machines before and I would love some help and tips so it could bring some revenue. I know that this machines are ancient but its what I got to work with so bare with meSo far I know about the electricity and internet cost which I pay in a regular basis so I don't worry about itI suspect if my landlord discovered I am mining he will raise my payments but this is not an issue at the moment My internet its paid as well and I shared the bill with my wife which is super supportive when it comes down to businessLet me explain...My landlord offered my a fix rate for my electricity which I been paying for the past 2 years. I don't really use much electricity in my house because I am was not here most of the time (At work) but since I am taking some time off I will be able to analyze and study the Cryptospace and see if it could be profitable (Mining). Hopefully I wont get caught because there its a ton of people living in the building aside from meMy plan is to mine recent coins with a future. Something recen<rest of post truncated>\n",

      "Um, hate to tell you this but the S3 (and s1, s2, s4, s5, s7, s9, T9, R4) ONLY mine Bitcoin or one of the few other SHA256D algo coins. Since the algo is hardwired into the chips that is all they can mine. Period. End of story.The coins you mentioned are altcoins and are mined using GPU-based rigs. Info for them is found in the altcoin hardware section.\"Came without wires\"? Such as what? All they need is a PSU and network connection.

      "I'm not sure how much revenue you are hoping to generate, but i reckon with all 4 machines you would be generating around $1 or $2 per day. You might struggle on some pools that do not pay out \"dust\" (ie very small and invaluable) rewards on a regular basis. i understand some pools pay these out on an annual basis so it saves transaction fee's etc. There are however upgrade kits you can buy that greatly increases the has rate of the S3's - search the forum and you will find them (unsure exactly where the post is). This will cost more money to do so, but i would certainly recommend looking into it at lease. PS - not sure on your set up, but 4 antminers will generate a lot of heat and noise\n",

      "Proposed question:I pre-ordered multiple FPGA Single, and I received them all.I pre-ordered multiple ASIC SCs, and I've received most of them. The rest were ordered later, and they haven't gotten to them yet.I will admit that I was contemplating ordering from KNC or BitFury, but now I'll have to reevaluate that position.Out of all the hardware being offered, this new Monarch's claimed specs seem to be the most profitable, and I don't imagine any new hardware coming along and changing that. (KNC is also 28nm, but it's not a full-custom chip. BitFury is a fully-custom chip, but it's only 45nm, not 28nm. Both are just starting to roll out, and neither has any units in customer's hands. Avalon or ASICMiner could die-shrink, but I don't think that will help. They'd have to redo everything to accommodate a larger, <truncated> design.)So they have a spotty track record, but they've always delivered. They seem to have the best product for sale (or pre-order, depending on how you look at it). Why shouldn't I buy one? Or 10?\n",

      "Forget about all the tech mumbo jumbo it all boils down to a very simple statement. By now most ASIC manufactures can self fund since they collected plenty of money over and above their costs on these 1st batches. Also they have plenty of information regarding hash rates, possible sales price points, wholesaler demands, consumer demands and prices they are willing to pay in relation to all the other factors, etc... So the only reason to do pre-orders now is because they think what they are getting now will be a lot more then what they possible can get if they simply built it and sold it as it is coming in. And that's the nice business version. The nasty version is we collect pre-order money build it and if it is worth more then what we collected we will sell a bunch out the back door or give out to friends and relatives first before starting to ship. I would love to hear a different argument.\n",

Does this not concern anyone that Bitcoin has less than 20k nodes and a hashrate hyper concentraded -- considering the narrative has always been censorship money. It is unlikely but Foundry the biggest mining pool with close to 30% of the network hashrate is based in the US -- there is a scenario in which the US could ban bitcoin, its usage or simply mining. What would happen in that case ?Does the concentration between AntPool and Foundry scare anyone? > Hashrates will be more and more concentrated over time [as the network grows in size and hardware becomes more expensive] does this not threaten the sovereignty of the network -- going fully against the Satoshi ethos ?How far did Satoshi envision the decentralisation, are there counter mesures at hyper concentration events? What could be done in order to mitigate that?Does it pose an existential threat to the value proposition of bitcoin ?I would like to get different views on that and none with the Stock-to-flow answer.This leads me to my ultimate question: if bitcoin is centralised how good is it ? notably in comparaison to oth<rest of post truncated>\n",

      "~16.5K reachable nodes[1] and ~75K nodes[2] isn't worrying for me. As for pool hashrate, my only concern is they could perform attack which doesn't attract much attention. For example, exclude certain transaction or fill block with their own \"non important\" transaction[3].

      "I'd say way better. If you argue that mining centralization is a big issue then other blockchains have other forms of centralization that might affect the network more than some miners mining in one pool IMO. For example, developers belong to one organization that needs to follow regulations where they live, new miners/node need to be approved by some people before they can start participating in the network, and so on. In my opinion, the chance that your transaction is blocked in such a blockchain is way higher than if you use Bitcoin, even if mining power is concentrated on one or two pools. CMIIW.\n",

      "If you look at the old information on pool hashrates by country, then China was in the lead before the ban on mining in this country. In POV mining, it is impossible to block transactions because miners want to get the maximum profit from their work. And in POS mining, the owners of most coins can always change the consensus rules.\n",

      "Who are these many? Pools have come close to if not gone over 50% in the past. And large groups of miners left them and went elsewhere. When pooled mining first became a thing there were only a couple of major pools and everyone else was still solo mining. It's not a real concern for people who understand that everything is always going to be in flux with this. The real major concern, which is still not a real concern, would be who controls the miners that are mining at these pools. If some government wanted to take over Bitcoin mining they could over a period of years acquire well over 50% of the hash rate. But if they took part of the hash rate and pointed it to one pool another part to another pool and so on, nobody would ever know about it until all the sudden they pointed it at their own pool.

      "Hi there I have been trying to connect my S5 Ant Miner to my network for the last week and it's just not working. I have done all the research I can and it has got me nowhere. I really need some help. I have a 1200 watt HP power supply with a breakout board adapter with 6 pin connectors. I've contacted the seller because i think they tried to short me do to the fact there are only 2 wires going into the 6 pin connectors instead of 6. The power supply is functioning and receiving power it has a led display that shows what the power output is. It says it's outputting 12.2. The miner powers up but I am unable to access the miner UI through the IP address. I am able to ping the miner and no pings are lost o% loss. There are 4 green lights and 1 red light in the middle, of the bottom antboard. I have pictures of the unit and the setup but am not able to attach them to this message. I'm definitely outside my depth rn and would love some help thanks all! New to the forums. Sorry if the question formatting is incorrect.\n",

Finally, I've come to the conclusion that my miners will sit idle until the crypto scene is once again profitable here in the land of $.15 per Kw/hour electricity. It hasn't even been a year since I started which leaves me with severely dashed hopes. But I am still hopeful for crypto to once again make headlines and have GPU prices soaring far past what they should be. I'm proud of my own accomplishments even though I haven't yet been profitable. I built a respectable fleet of miners totalling 15 GPUs across 5 platforms. I gained an appreciation for server managers as they are surely profiting despite recent slow downs. I sorted through code, learned about compilation and dependencies and tweaked/optimized feverishly to attain optimized mining results.I do continue mining on some cards that are more cost effective so I have some meager bitcoin coming my way but not much.

      "1) Make sure the PSU will turn on without being plugged into anything with the \"paperclip test\" <link> it does not power on then you have a bad (or 2 bad) PSU and need a replacement, I recommend at least 750 watt preferably 1000W+2) If PSU does power on, then make sure you are connecting the power cables correctly:Note: some of the internal cables and connectors could come loose during shipping. Not likely but possible, they should be checked to make sure a flush and tight connection is made - make sure everything is plugged all the way in.The far left 6-pin port connects via a short cable to the controller board. Don't mess with it. Next to it is the ATX_24p connector. It has 24 pins and it connects to the big 24 pin connector (some PSU have 20 + 4 that need to be pinched together during plug in, this can cause a problem if the 20 pin clicks in but the +4 pin is not completely plugged in). Make sure the PSU 24 pin is plugged in correctly, with the depressable tab on \"top\" facing to the right where it matches up with the tab catcher on \"top\". It should click when it is all the way plugged in. It is a tight fit and hard to get this plug in without hurting your fingers or using needl<rest of post truncated>\n",

      "### Original post:\n",
      "I am relatively new to bitcoin mining and it's really hard to decide on which hardware to buy and from where. I see all the complaints about buying a pre order, so I will never pay for something that is not already shipping. Then there are those obviously fake websites trying to claim that they have a 15 TeraHash miner and another that advertises that by September they will have a miner running at 6 TeraHashes for only $5,000. And then even if you want to buy a machine that is actually real, would you send your money to China with no recourse if you don't receive your machine. Why do these companies only want to be paid in bitcoins or with a wire transfer, if they are not scams? Now I see a company advertising a 600 GH and a 1 TH PCI card - wouldn't that be great if we could use our computers again to mine for bitcoins, but I'm not going to take a chance and pre-order one of these cards for $3,000.I want to buy something with a credit card or with Paypay. I have purchased my mining hardware from EBay - I have 9 Antminer S1 systems. They may not be the latest and best, but I have received them without being ripped off.I'd like to know what every thinks about all the scams out there <rest of post truncated>\n",

I lost money in the stock market - I don't plan on losing money by buying coins. I don't know why the latest strategy and suggestion is to buy bitcoins? Maybe when you could buy 10,000 for $1 when they first came out as a joke, but not at $600. Sure, it's possible that a coin will be $5,000 a year from now, but I have my doubts.\n",

You won't be able to run an S2 profitably (assuming $0.10/kwh) after network rate hits ~800m.

      "Agreed. Chip buyers should be refunded to equalize this price point at bare minimum. They are literally selling entire pre-built units for HALF the price that chip buyers paid for just the chips to go into a unit.For example, 320 chips at half the price of a unit = 7.5btc which comes out to .0234btc per chip. 10,000 chips * .0234 = BTC234. Thus, it equates that chip purchasers should be refunded at LEAST BTC550 per order. Even at that price point Avalon would cover their costs of the chips and still be making a significant profit margin on the chips.\n",

      "### Original post:\n",
      "I just got a new iMac at work (I'm a PC/linux guy, but my boss is a Mac guy). It has a ATI 6970, which is one of the best video cards for bitcoin mining today. So I figure I'll download Diablo miner and set it up to run with default settings. Apparently Open CL doesn't work very well on a Mac, so I was only mining at about 1/4 the rate that the 6970 would get in a PC, but still figured it would be worth it to run it over the weekend.So I come back on Monday, and the computer is froze. I restart, and I'm getting visual artifacts on the screen, and it freezes, usually at the login screen, sometimes it logs in, only to have more video artifacts, and freezes shortly after. I'm pretty sure I fried the video card. I'm assuming that the iMac must have really bad cooling on the video card, and it overheated. Aren't there any safety features to shut down the computer if the hardware is getting dangerously hot?I load in safe mode, and delete everything related to bitcoin or the diablo miner, and call the company's tech guy complaining my New iMac is acting up, acting like I have no idea why it would do that.\n",

Now it's about on par with a USB Block Erupter which only consumes 2.5 Watts vs 300 to 400 watts your Mac would draw if it even worked, and a Block Erupter isn't worth mining with anymore as it draws too much power.

      "running a fan at 70 or 75 or 80 or 85 or 90 percent static setting is far better then auto tuning a fan.100% setting is stupid as it burns up and does not cool much better then 90%auto tuning also kills them.I try to set fans to 70 and track temps if needed bump to 75. and up to 90 if needed.Antminer gear can sometimes use a lower fan even a 4000 rpm set to 90% may work depends on what miner you are using.all s9's will run with a 4700 rpm model set to 85% static.now it may be you set a really high freq and are burning up with that fan but the miner will try to run.When it checks the fans for speed to determine you have working fans it looks for the fans to get up to 4000 rpm or higher at 100% .this is a slower lower energy fan<link> gear will run on a low speed setting with this fan. I use it to make one and 2 board space heating s9'sdo not get any fan weaker than this.also have a good understanding OF WHAT YOU ARE DOING IF YOU GO THE LOWER WEAKER FAN ROUTE.ie don't think an s9 will do 3 boards at 15th with these fans.\n",

      "The racks are far from fragile. Big or small they are quite sturdy. As see in the pic each shelf has a lip perfect for attaching things to including drywall if desired.Those were 1kW stand-by UPS's. The old S1's only drew about 450w and at the time power at home in my area blipped off-on at least 1 once a month so it was practical to use them. Now days with miner power needs over 1kw I would not advise using UPS's unless absolutely needed. Just too expensive.\n",

      "Thank you...So if I just use the ones with the 4 it will be much cheaper. I will be able to use 2 of those to plug 8 units for just 80 bucks where as this 50 amp one costs 299 dollars and will house just 9 units...I think that would be okay, right?\n",

      "### Original post:\n",
      "It's looking like the initial set-up I'll be going for is 2x Avalon 741 & 1x Antminer L3+. It's not a major set-up or anything, but it's going to generate a sufficient amount of heat. To make it worse, I'm located in Louisiana... 100+ F temps in the summer with A LOT of humidity. I'd appreciate your suggestions on how to manage the heat and airflow. I'll be installing a 220V line for whatever space in which the miners end up unless you guys feel that is unnecessary. Noise is a concern (wife and 4 kids), but I'm not opposed to installing sound insulation if necessary. I'm an engineer and am not afraid of doing any of the work myself (except for any electrical). Options: House is large, has AC, and has room to store the miners within a closet or within an enclosure in the utility room. Note: Utility RM shares boundary with garage and is immediately adjacent to breaker panel (opposite side of wall). It also has access to the existing dryer vent, which goes directly outside of the house. Possibly a very bad idea given the high fire-risk of dryer lint.I have an attic with a lot of available space to set up the miners. Note: likely not an option due to how hot the ambient temperature in <rest of post truncated>\n",

      "I was checking through your photos, and was wondering, are your exhaust fans constantly running, or do you have them set on a temperature switch for on/off operation. I'm looking into different designs for next spring and didn't want to forget to ask? At the moment I am looking into the best way to rig my avalon exhaust to my furnace return air intake in the basement. My plan is to widen my return air intake in the basement and mount my miners within a few feet, and restrict the main air intakes on my main level by half or so. I might just have to run a few feet of ducting wide enough to accommodate the airflow to within a foot of the miner exhaust. I figure by running my furnace fan constantly instead of on/off with the thermostat, I can keep a steadier heat in the house and that will be the most efficient use of the miner heat. The 4 miner set up will equal about 20% of my furnace at full capacity, so with steady fan circulation this will greatly offset my power consumption costs, as I'm going to need it anyways.Winter is coming.\n",

      "No that was to make up for their screw up.Coupons vary in quality. Some are 10% some are 20 % some are 30 %So if you do an order for 1000 and have a 300 dollar 10% coupon you get to use 100 of the coupon. and the order becomes 900a 1000 order with a 300 dollar 20% coupon you get to use 200 of the coupon and the order becomes 800a 1000 order with a 300 dollar 30% coupon you get to use 300 of the coupon and the order becomes 700So 30% coupons have more value then 10% coupons.Of course if you don't need the coupons they can be given for free to other people or you can try to sell them aftermarket .The sales section for bitmain coupons would be digital goods.<link> is an older offer to buy coupons<link> is an old offer to sell some<link> anyone now waiting on a bitmain order this post may help you get some compensation coupons.\n",

      "While I expect it's valuable in terms of effort, I don't see why it would be absolutely critical to get everything changed at once on N miners. What happens if you do N/2 in the afternoon, and N/2 the next morning? I can't imagine the pools would care, nor would the S5 miners. If I had N (N>1) miners I would clearly consider spreading their hash rate across multiple pools. And I certainly wouldn't lose any sleep over the fact they might have different settings. They are all running at different speeds anyway, and using different amounts of power at some level.\n",

      "I use MiningRigRentals for managing pools, of all things. You don't have to use their services, but I can simply point all my miners to their proxy servers once when I first set them up, and then in my account I can manage several different pool configs and groupings easily. Plus, if you decide you want to put your miners up for rent it's easy too. For example say i have about 30 miners. I have 6 different groups of them, each one has 5 miners in the group. I have 6 different mining profiles with different pools and priorities, each one assigned to a group. I set a price for renting them, and if price goes above, it switches to renting, otherwise it mines at the pools I've configured. Switching pools is a few clicks in their web interface.I used to do it by custom written Linux scripts, but this method is so much easier. On top of that I use M's MinerMonitor (you can find it under the mining software us forum) to monitor all of them for their performance, temps, etc.\n",

I would give Minera a shot as it will run on a raspberry pi -<link> using a raspberry pi you will save electricity compared to a full size pc running 24x7.And MiningRigRentals has some intresting options. I personally don't use it but if you had a miner in a data cener you can't change pool easy setting it to MiningRigRentals will allow you to change pools. And the better way is probley setting up a proxy which I think the amazon free EC2 should be able to do fine.\n",

It really allows you to see which miners are underperforming and need to be tweaked. And it automatically attempts to recover miners that go down.

      "### Original post:\n",
      "Sorry that I'm reposting this from the newbies section, but I think I would get much better help here.First of all here is some information that should help. I am currently running windows 7 premium 64 bit. The motherboard is a MSI 880G-E45, and I have used it to run 3 5830's in the past when running win XP 32 bit. The PCI-e slots are arranged as follows: 16x(runs at 1x because I tried using tape to force it to 1x), 1x (covered by 1st card), 1x(PCIe x1 extender attached to this), 1x(back cut out to allow 2nd card to be inserted onto mobo). The only real difference between this setup and when it was running XP is that when it was running XP the first 3 PCIe slots were all occupied by pciex1 extenders, leaving the 4th slot empty, but now the first, third, and fourth slot are occupied. When I try to boot up with a card attached to the 3rd slot via extender cable, the computer freezes at the windows boot screen, restarts, and then the bios says that a Hyper Transport Sync Flood Error has occurred. I don't know if it makes any difference, but the PCIEx16 slot is a 2.0 slot and I assume the x1 slots are all PCIE 1.0 because they are not listed as 2.0 in GPU-z, like the 16x slot is.What w<rest of post truncated>\n",

After reaching that power would attempt to invest in the DESIGN and MANUFACTURE own chip to add more speed, thus avoiding the dependence on other companies that take months to send you orders, if at sometime. All this process will be completely free, without any cost to the shareholder and completely transparent.- Income payments will be made when a certain threshold (selected by the shareholder) is exceeded. These earnings will be deducted the cost of electricity and internet, plus a 2% for maintenance costs.- The mining would be operational around late November early December.- He put a phone number once started mining to resolve any questions or problems.

      "Sure thing. If you want the batch version I would split it up into two scripts, one to get the info and one to compile to csv. Make a new folder, where you will put everything into.

Location can be anything you want, even just 1 2 3 etc. Just make sure it is like (location) - (IP) on each line, nothing blank or different format.In this folder you also need a powershell script. Make one and call it clearNull.ps1, with this <truncated> \".\\_\\\" | ForEach { (Get-Content $($_.fullname)) -replace \"`0\", \"\" | Set-Content $($_.fullname) -NoNewline }Now make a .bat file for multithreading.

      "### Original post:\n",
      "Alright, so I was gonna buy a 5830 from NewEgg to replace my 3850 and start mining, but that opportunity is out the door. I have found someone selling a used sapphire 5850 xtreme on CL and he seems like a nice enough guy, but of course I'm wary. After asking if I could see it in action before buying, he has offered to video it running in his case with a fairly intense 3D game on the monitor, and show that to me when I come to pick it up. I realize this is a pretty big risk, but the price is right. Plus, I have no problem banging the shit out of his door if it's defective until we meet an agreement. Any advice?\n",

      "### Original post:\n",
      "about a month ago I got a used S7 that has run ok for now. However i've had to reboot a couple of times and I suspect it's because it went over 80C and stopped. I check the board temperatures and one is running at 70-71C while the other two boards are running at 62-63C. Could this be an indication the miner needs a dustoff ? I'm running it next to an S5 (about 4 inches apart) so my other thought is that maybe the S5 is generating heat that is conducting to the S7 board closest to it. The S5 boards are running at 56-65C.Thank you for any help you can provide.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Reply 1:\n",
      "possibility that S5 is influencing the higher temperature but to rule that out, you can move S7 into another air conditioned room and power it up and check the temperature. If in colder air conditioned room and 1 pcb is showing still hotter temperature, then, time to open the unit and see if cleaning be needed. We have seen many units with temperature problem had everything you can think of collected and saved on the hash PCB and inside the S7 case.dust, human hair, animal hair, hairball, candy wrappers, parts of vermine, insects. So dust off may help if that is the case.If dust off and in the cold room and the temperature will not be resolved, then please check the intake fan, if it is spinning at at least 3600 RPM. if none of those solves the problem... then you probably have some chips or components that are degraded but still function. At this stage, not sure if its cheap enough to repair or seek used S7 and replace the parts or let it goRepair on S7 pcb can cost from $35-$85 range some are less and some are more.\n",

      "### Reply 2:\n",
      "I can't move the S7 to another room but I can power down the S5 for a trial period. So I will do that first. As for the fans I just checked and they are running at 4500 rpm or so. I have seen a lot of dust on the fans so I imagine there's dust on the inside. I saw a few videos on how to clean the S7 so I will take that up once the S5 power down test is complete. As for repairs it's too costly for me to send it for repairs. Are all boards on an s7 the same? this way I could just get a new-er board and keep as spare.\n",

      "So today I got an alert that my S7 was offline, again! I couldn't go to turn it back on for almost 8 hours. Thanks to you and some you tube videos I had a pretty good idea that I had to clean it and how. I finally went to my S7 and took it apart. There was caked dust along with some real life bugs that caused obstruction on the front end of the boards. One more than the others. I spent a whole bottle of compressed air cleaning it up inside out and took out each board and blew all the dust out. Eventually I figured I got all the dust out that I could. I put it back together and turned it on. It wouldn't turn on at first but I figured out I hadn't plugged in the front fan first. Plugged it in and got it working fine. Temps are now in the 50-60 range versus the 60-75 range that was before. I hope it can now work for months without stopping. Thank you all for your help.\n",

That's computer sweat settling in.Water and electricity don't match; you'd need a dehumidifier running 24/7 but then you lose your cold temp since a dehu is a small heater.Once this computer sweat is materialized and melted by the chip heat, turns to water.This makes it at high risk of fire because water can cause serious short circuits. Either way, you'd be better off with S3's since the C1 is designed to be liquid coo<rest of post truncated>\n",

      "Please use a chocolate on top of yourself Banana, it might to make you more useful than suggesting stupid things. If you don't know anything about it, do not suggest please.C1 has four heatsinks and two water blocks. With thermal paste from Bitmain, of course. It is enough to cool C1 at cold ambient only by air when underclocked to 225MHz. All Antminers have overtemperature control which stops mining at 80C+, and undocumented failure control which shuts down system at temps over 100C. It is not recommended to run any device at high temperatures, but IC chips used by Bitmain has guaranteed working temperature at 125C (with lower efficiency).\n",

What specifications should I go for? 3. What are those odd looking miners, I haven't seen those things in my part of world. Are they exclusively for mining, can I get such things in cheap prices through DHL or other couriers? Are there any other options? 4. Mining pools seems easier then collecting the hardware, is there something I need to know beforehand. Please suggest me, and share your experience.

Too many factors involved: delivery not on time if ever, pre orders are mostly scam/long con, electrical hazard leading to home or building fires, electrical and cooling costs to keep equipment from overheating, difficulty too high and pool luck variance, constantly monitoring and maintaining the equipment is a pain...Alot of things have to bounce right for a miner to even come close to even, or just to minimize loss.It's basically the opposite of the Hunger Games mantra \"May the odds never be in your favor\".\n",

      "Although I cannot answer your question specifically, please understand that your task is completely academic.. meaning that you task will teach you, and help learn/understand the process, but not benefit you financially in any way.Please don't take this the wrong way.. I was GPU mining back when difficulty was 12 Million, and 10 GPUs would net about 1 bitcoin every two weeks... plus or minus as machines kept dying in the summer heat.. Difficulty is currently 59 Billion, 335 Million, 351 thousand, and change.., or significantly higher than my example... Today, those 10 GPUs would only net me pennies, per month.. The only benefit would be to offset the heat cost in the house, or educational.If your goal is educational, I'm sure several people on the forum would gladly donate old mining gear to you for the cost of shipping -- and you would burn far less electricity than a GPU, and be able to dive right in to Asic history.If your goal is to obtain bitcoin, it's best just to buy it.\n",

      "SkyscraperFarms Guide to setting up a Block Erupter Cube 30-38GH/s in WindowsI spent a few aggravating hours trying to set one of these babies up. Most guides gloss over a lot of the settings. This is my attempt to help make it easier for some of you.(**) these are the areas where I had most difficulty and it seems most people did not have these issues.(*) is only pertinent to those setting up multiple cubes. If you are only setting up 1 cube, ignore these * hints.1. Tighten/re-screw heat sink screws. Every cube I received had this problem. You will need to unscrew both front and back plates. Unplug cooling fan. Carefully slide the board and blades out all together. There are guide rails that the blades may get stuck on from shifting and you may need to adjust so it slides out evenly. Make sure all screws in heat sinks are tight. Then reassemble.2. Attach to PSU. You will need a PSU with at least two 6pin PCI-E cables on it and runs at 280W, preferably more.3. Insert 30amp Fuse into Cube. I had a few fuses start to melt until I only pushed them in partially, enough to make the connection. (This only happened on high when the unit starts to get really hot, an external fan helped too<rest of post truncated>\n",

I have 0 incentive to buy from ssinc in amounts of 20 sticks. while business is business you are hurting other resellers like myself which in turn will hurt ssinc , dabs and Thomas_s I never begrudge anyone trying to make a buck and I will link your post to the bitminter forum letting them know that small 2 stick sales would be cheaper with you.\n",

Using your proposed logic we'd have to call BFL reputable because they delivered FPGAs. The reason black arrow is 'yes' and bitmine isn't is because there are reports that bitmine is refusing to refund. Sound familiar? Forgot to copy in KNC, I'll do it now.\n",

I do not know bitmine tos, so they might have same tos regarding refund request as black arrow. Sorry, i disagree on legitimacy question regarding those to company. Black arrow did not even taped out yet so how can they be more legitimate ghen bitmine?Also you defended your reasoning of black arrow trustwothy status delivering in the past, so i reminded you of bitmine doing the same with avalon clones.EditAcording to bitmine tos buyer can requst an refund with 10% on top after 61 days delay.Further, they add hasing power on each 10 days of delivery delay. What option or protection plan black arrow has?You can not judge whole company legitimacy by refund reqest, what are handled acording to tos and case by case where you do not have all relevant information.You have delivered set to yes for black arrow! They delivered lancelots and miners based on bitfury chips, so bitmine deserve the same \"yes\" as they have delivered avalon clones.

They do not refund anybody at this time, that could change but that does not change a facts.Can you point on refund complaints where bitmine denie refunds. Plese exclude trolls and newaccounts.Look here, black arrow mat does not even know will they allow refund let alone that tbey refund everybody who ask it!!<link> tos does matter, if an customer did not agreed on their terms then he did not have to order.

You can also set to not remove individual coins, even if they drop from CoinChoose.

If you don't happen to see the notification, a log entry is also created.

I informed Polmine via PM to one of their forum admins.

      "### Original post:\n",
      "How come a company that talks a lot about fairness totally ignores the interests of most their customers?We, the majority who wasn't lucky to be in the right timezone, now have to pay for the few lucky ones got into 1-500 batch?It will be our money that should enable the mere production of ASIC devices, yet we will silently step aside to let the few gunshots reap the rewards. That's what KnCMiner call fair. I called them out with the email to give the exact estimation and placement of my order but didn't hear back. This is probably because KncMiner fair process cant be judged by a random dude from the > 500 order batch.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Reply 1:\n",
      "Just to clarify for you, You would have been in the 1-500 batch if you placed a pre-order during an approximately week long period in April after they first announced their miners (so it has nothing to do with timezone, but you're right you needed to be aware of their existence). What has happened now, is they are giving 7 days to those people with pre-orders to pay and confirm their spot in the queue. The possible unfairness is that some people placed pre-orders (at no cost) with no intention of every paying for an order and now those people are able to sell their pre-order slots at a premium. I actually don't think this is unfair, those people had the foresight to place a pre-order and now others want it so they can demand a premium. That is how a free market works. Full disclosure: I did buy a pre-order slot from someone and have placed an order with knc and I was happy to do it.\n",

      "Absolutely, you can't get a company like ORSoC to partner with you without demonstrating that there is a demand for the product you are developing and that is exactly what pre-orders do.I don't know why people are complaining about having to pay now. They accept credit cards via paypal, so if you are really concerned that they won't come through, that is one way to do it with minimal risk.I'll be very interested to hear the feedback after the open day tomorrow.\n",

      "I was thinking, oh this is no problem just add one line so it sends an email.BUT this was a little bit more complicated. Because if the temp is at the $HIGH warning point, it sleeps 2 seconds and the goes on again. If I just put a mail command there it sends a mail every few seconds, probably not so good LOL.So I made a timestamp and check if it sent mail in the last 5 minutes(found that here: <link> how to make it send the ok temps every hour? I now made it log the tempsto a file, so you can make a cronjob that mails it to you every hour <truncated> I think this script had a bug, the shutdown stuff never executed becauseeven if you reach $SHUTDOWN_TEMP, the temp is higher then the $HIGH tempand so it never went into the else loop. Moved that shutdown stuff at the beginning now,so it gets checked first. But I probably created more bugs now haha You can start the script with a $ at the end, so it keeps running in the background.Maybe you have a startup script for your miners, then you can just add it at the <truncated> 1 2 3 4 <truncated> truedo for card in $CARDS; do # read temp TEMP=$(DISPLAY=:0 aticonfig --adapter=$card --odgt |grep 'Sensor'|awk -F\\ '{ print $5 }'|cut -d. -f1) if<rest of post truncated>\n",

      "I actually took out the high temp part and just left in the shutdown part. My room is air conditioned so if the temp is ever up to that then there's something seriously wrong and it should be shut down. My setup would not warrant clocking gpu's down for cooling.Also I used a little program called sendEmail, it allows you to send email from the command line with minimal setup (very basic). I put all my details into a second script and call it from the first. It will tell me that the temp has exceeded and it's shutting down - just so I'm aware!\n",

      "Perhaps you should go to cgminer.It has control system over fan and engine clock (you can switch them or not) in order to set temperature under fixed target (by default 75C). You can define highest temp to stop mining (def. 85C) and highest temp to keep away (def. 95C).Give it a try. It's sticked in top ten.\n",

      "I am trying to estimate the cost of mining Genesis block for a research paper and wish to narrow down variables to the best i can.

      "Interesting question!A quick web search reveals that people in 2011 were doing 65kHash/s on a single thread. Disconnected from Bitcoin Core though; just a simple standalone C program doing SHA256 hashes. <link> very well possible that in 2008, hashrate was quite a bit lower, maybe 10kHash/s on similar hardware; of course, satoshi may have used a laptop giving lower numbers.Your calculation does assume a bunch of things, though:[1] The timestamps are 100% correct. Problem:[2] He started hashing with nonce=0 and incremented by 1. Problem: It's not required nor enforced to do it like that. You could also generate a random number every time or maybe after 1000 iterations and count up from there.That being said, it was the very first version of Bitcoin Core and both assumptions may very well have held true back then. I'm just not 100% sure, since by today things are a lot different; timestamps are even used as a kind of 'extra nonce' and deliberately time-shifted. Just make sure since you are doing this for a research paper, that your assumptions are indeed true.PS: I'd recommend moving this to 'Development & Technical Discussion'.

      "The timestamp can be adjusted forwards or backwards to the miner's will, no matter whether there is competition or not. Same with the way the nonce is selected. But I don't know why he would have done something like that. Most likely, your assumptions hold true. I'm also not aware, when exactly miners started playing with the timestamp as secondary nonce.This would be a question probably best answered by long-time miners from the Mining board, like philipma1957 and NotFuzzyWarm.On most boards, you can do it yourself just on the bottom left corner.There's even a 'Lesson' about it <link> can quickly find topics using the <link> search tool, by the way. Much better than forum search.Despite my name, I'm not an expert on nonce-search tweaking. I do understand what you're trying to do; personally I'd mostly stick to the maths and maybe write an isolated example to gather some benchmarks. But in theory, mining is a completely random process and you should not get any better or worse results in the long run whether you just count up or do something more complex.\n",

      "While it may have been able to be adjusted to any value initially, the genesis block clearly states the earliest date it could have been generated.Read the coinbase sig.Alas, bitcoin rules (which means all mining) sets limits on the value it can have as stated above.As I regularly state when the subject of the 'block timestamp' comes up, the stamp is not 'the time the block was mined'It is either when the pool sent the work to the miner or what it was adjusted to by mining code (or the pool).But adjusting the timestamp is no longer required with stratum, and all pools other than those setup by n00bs who don't know what they are doing, use stratum.Stratum was designed for this reason, to put extra nonces in the coinbase sig, not use the timestamp.This u<rest of thread truncated>\n",

      "### Original post:\n",
      "Good Morning GuysI wish my first post wasn't a \"problem\" post but like so many, I found your site looking for some rhyme or reason as to the behaviour of my nice new Antminer S3+ (batch 9)Set it up last night and all was good - hashing away at about 430-450 Gh/s as expected. Came to look at it this morning and is seems to be cuttin out all together, suddenly coming back to life as the right speed then 10 minutes later dropping off to zero before restarting again. This is after about 12 hours continuous running if that helps?Now, I also have an Antminer S1 running and another S3 running elsewhere, both of which are behaving as they should which rules out the mining pool. I know the configuration within the unit must be right or it wouldn't be mining at all which again, rules that out.I have this set up with an Aerocool Intergrator 600W +80W PSU (<link> using the daisy chained connector. Could this be causing an abnormal load on the PSU? Would it work better if the individual plugs were used?I am also hardwired into an Ethernet Hub so no wireless connection issues.Can anyone shed any light on this as I need to get this running properly obviously?Thanks\n",

      "PSU should be ok as its a single rail so should have no issues no matter if your using one or two cables. I am wondering what the temp on the miner is getting up to? You can see the temp on the status page. You would be better to post this on the S3 thread than start a new one. <link>\n",

      "### Reply 2:\n",
      "Thanks for the reply - I'm in work at the moment so can't interrogate the unit but I'll try that when I get back. I have purposefully positioned it so it has a clear air path all around (I work in building services so understand that in order to maximise cooling, there needs to be open air around all sides, similar to a water to air heat exhanger).It is just baffling me why it would effectively shut off, restart and run fine for 10 minutes before repeating the process.I'll copy this into the S3 thread (didn't know it existed - oops - newbie alert )\n",

That means they have some chips, are assembling and testing some, and are obviously close to shipping. They might even be packaging right now. Their original statement that they later buried was that they were realistically going to ship right before Christmas. Then they said October so everyone placed their pre-orders with their company instead of their competition. Then they backpedaled and kept saying \"well, we don't know though\" and \"it might be later\" and tada, we're back at reality where we started from.Also, the Steve Jobs in that cartoon would be where he's going already if he wasn't using Apple Maps.\n",

      "I'm looking for some second opinions about the longevity of my setup. I have 3x6970 in one rig and another 1x5870 hashing away.Current settings using cgminer on the 6970s are:950/685 (mem is lowest I can get without flashing BIOS)V=1.175 (can't adjust in cgminer or afterburner)I = 9Fan = 85% on 2 cards, 95% on the hottest cardTemp = 79C on Hottest card, 70C on coolest.Powertune = 10@ 425 m/hash eachCurrent settings using cgminer on the 5870 are:980/350V = 1.130I=9Fan = 40%Temp = 53CPowertune = 0 (Can't adjust for this card on cgminer)@405 m/hashMy questions:1) Is 950 core or 79C too much/high for the 6970?2) Is 980 core (stock 850) too high for the 5870?3) Are the fan speeds on the 6970s an issue? They are HIS 6970s.4) Most importantly, does an increased core clock affect the longevity of a card independent of temperature and voltage? I assume 53C and 40% fan to be no concern, but does a +130mhz overclock present a problem for longevity in and of itself?I'd really not like my card warranties to be voided because I leave some burns somewhere or something.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Reply 1:\n",
      "All by itself, the clock does not influence the longevity in any way.However, power consumption and dissipation rise linearly along with clock speed and those two factors are the chip killers when the microscopically small traces inside the chip \"burn up\" (actually, it's electromigration that kills them - a process where electric current displaces molecules of the conductor it's running through).Load (heat and current) also leads to degradation of transistors inside the chip to the point where they become unstable at speeds they used to run at without any issues. If your card suddenly starts crashing where it used to run stably for months dropping the clocks is the only solution.95% fan speed (or even 85%) is something you should worry about. When manufacturers cut corners, fan quality goes first. Chances are that when purchasing inexpensive 10$ case fans you are getting much higher quality devices than the ones mounted on your 300$ card...70..79C is not a bad temperature range for a battery of overclocked 6970s locked in a PC case. If it's an open rig, try increasing the distance between cards or pointing more airflow directly at them.It's a bloody damned shame that your manufture<rest of post truncated>\n",

      "I have nothing bad to say about Avalon personally.But it does seem to me for the great amount of business they are doing, and the great products they have, a little bit would go a long way. I'm sure in China it would be fairly inexpensive to hire a min wage dedicated secretary or customer service person to assist with running the day-to-day stuff, while Yifu and the other BTC champions can be freed up to do more important stuff. Even just having a full-time employee in this sort of role doing this one day a week would really help the situation out massively.\n",

They have the money, they are making a huge mark up on their bulk chips.In his recent talk at Bitcoin 2013 he admitted the team hate the customer service aspect and want to concentrate on development and engineering, that's what motivates them.That's understandable, I'd be like that too, but you can't afford to loose sight of the fact if your customers are unhappy, you don't get the funding for development and it's such an easy fix to to hire someone to make your life more efficient and rewarding and keep your customer base happy as well.\n",

My comment revolved around an ideal world theory, not real world limitations...I keep seeing them as a bunch of undeniably smart rogue students, but to be fair what they've achieved this far is nothing short of miraculous and takes a huge amount of organisational skills!They could easily sell out to someone local and outside the community if they so wished.

      "By right never and never used EMS to send your boxes or documents out of china, it is control by and belongs to the government. Always used DHL/Fedex or UPS to get your goods send out.Avalon customer service needs to be improved. I wonder why can't they get anyone or workers in to help? Ngzhang or yifu sure hasfamilies or relatives in china, hire these people and is common knowledge that factories bosses always prefer to hire their own family members to work for them and getting 1 or 2 person in the help desk should not be an issue. I think a lot of this emails coming in are not open or even read? because they are too busy with R&D and production. I would say butterfly service is also terrible.\n",

      "### Original post:\n",
      "Hi,This is a method to do mine hopping the way you want on Windows (tested on Windows 7 and above).The question is: i want to mine on pool x for so much time, solo for this much, on pool y for some other time and then cycle again.There problem is evident if you have only 1 hardware device, but if you have more than one device you can use Multiminer to tell each device what to mine. This kind of gives half a solution, because if you have a 10 GHs unit and a 100 GHs, you cannot split it 50-50. Also, some might say that running one device for a long period of time is/isn't equivalent to running one faster device for a shorter period of time, so the total number of lotto tickets is the same, as with time the later tickets might have less chance (point of view).Anyway, here is the code:1. Download cgminer and put it in a folder of its own, say \"cgminer-3.12.2\"2. Create a batch file inside that folder, call it whatever.bat (.bat makes it an executable batch file)3. Put the code below in the file (please read it as you need to personalize it to your <truncated> cgminer.exe -o 127.0.0.1:nnn -u username -p passwordtimeout /t 120 /nobreaktaskkill /im cgminer.exe /f /s localhost /u yourwindow<rest of post truncated>\n",

      "Why, Just use --load-balance and feed both pools simultaneously, you can even change the balance between the pools so one receives more shares than the other.\n",

      "Hi,Thank for the feedback. With load balance and a number of miners (more than 10), 24 hrs of mining on ghash.io gave 50% duplicates. The equipment keeps jumping from one pool to another. It did not work for me...More precisely, the way i used --load-balance was by downloading Multiminer's source code from github and making some tweaks. That said, it relies on how the parameter was implemented in the software, I have not tested it myself directly in command line, just relied on feedback from the experience. I might give it a try but atm it feels better to have 100% all in one lump on one load. It's really a matter of personal decision, consider the two positions:One: i have a couple of USB miners not using anymore, I'm running them solo mining bitcoin, who knows, I might get lucky, I know the odds are probably I will find it in 800 days, and that is assuming the difficulty does not increase in 800 days, but it is better than having them making cents on cex.io.Two: if the odds are too low to win, then it is better to have them making cents on cex.io (no ad intended) rather than making nothing in solo.So the idea is, even if --load-balance was to work properly, some might not think i<rest of post truncated>\n",
