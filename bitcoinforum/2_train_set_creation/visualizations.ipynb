The last email I have is the password reset I needed to do on the avalon store since it wasn\\'t giving me my activation email when I signed up. I purchased as a guest on walletbit, and while walletbit was waiting to confirm with the ajaxy QR code, the tab crashed in chrome. Either way, sleep now, and hopefully everything will be magic by the time I wake up.

I don\\'t trust sending $1500 to an address generated by a failing web site. If Avalon cancels my order and places me in the back of the queue I\\'m not sure I will re-order.<sep>there is no such thing as a placeholder order, there was only a mistake, which will have to get fixed.<sep>We just called them place holder because it was a complete order, just for the wrong amount.<sep>Exactly.Senseless, if might be helpful if you change the description to something like \"paid, but with different amount due to website errors\". I think that is a more accurate description of the situation.<sep>Placed and paid (payment was sent from MtGox) order for 3.<link><sep>Ordered 1 device in the first, introduced the full data, successfully redirected to the Walletbit, paid 0,05 BTC, my cart is empty.<link><sep>3 units paid with trade in against 3 Icarus boards, paid a bit more than 181 BTCs...Gn8,Ecki<sep>It is pretty unfair if they do this. People had no control over if they were provided the correct amount or incorrect amount to pay. People who paid the incorrect amounts did so simply to hold the order. Avalon should fix that, not cancel the orders, everyone will be willing to pay the correct amount when requested.<sep>1 Placeholder Payment Sent:<link> Destination Address <truncated> One other in cart but I\\'m trying to pay as a registered walletbit user this time and my deposits to them haven\\'t shown up yet:<link> successful and walletbit confirmation confirmed: <link><sep>well not cancelling placeholder amounts would be unfair to those that saw it but knew something was obviously wrong<sep>order for 2 units, fully paid, no confirmation of any kind, no mail no order inside avalon shop <link> what?spiccioli<sep>order for 1 unit. I think this is OK.<link><sep>Ecki, I know you own several Icarus cause we purchased in the same original batch, but do they ask for confirmation or pictures of our Icarus or something? I couldn\\'t get past the \"Add To Cart\" page for some reason, it just stuck on \"Updating cart...\". I actually still have the page up, I wonder if it\\'s because I use a custom version of Chrome or something.<sep>bought 2 but have not been able to finish the 0.5 btc checkout !<sep>Bought 1 but did not send that partial payment amount because it was wrong. Waiting for the dust to settle before sending any btc.<sep>I sent only a token \"placeholder\" amount to <truncated> for my order. I did not want to send the fully requested amount of 75.65502117, because I was not sure the order was recorded properly.If I send the full amount to the address above now, can I complete the order?Thanks.Order screenshot: <link> have also submitted a support ticket.<link><sep>Bought one, then shopping chart said its empty, added another one, managed to get to checkout, removed one, tried to pay, said I have to pay 0.05xxx BTC. I payed required 0.05xxxx in order to keep my order up. I didn\\'t attempt to refresh, I was pretty sure I would lose the order.<sep>Tried to buy one, but got to a walletbit payment for 0 BTC. It showed up as verified without needing to send anything. Does this count?<sep>Sorry guys. bittenbob has already posted about this.. any small payments will be refunded.. <link><sep>The odd thing is i kept the url to walletbit and last i checked it shows the right amount. I just want to know if it is safe to pay yet or not.... I never sent the small amount. I just refreshed the url a bit later and it shows the right amount.<sep>Yeah, I read.However, bashing customer for their poor service is deplorable. I\\'m sure this will be remembered.<sep>send people who payed the amount they were asked to pay an invoice for the remaining amount and keep their place in line. it is fair. it is not the customers\\' fault they were presented the wrong amount. we changed our weekend plans to be here for your sale, we stayed up, we believed in you, we f-5, we are willing to spend, your side screwed up,, do not punish the customer. i do not think i will stay awake for one of your events again. my partial payment proves everything you need. just send invoices for the remaining amount!<sep>14:47 i placed an order for .05 btc*edit* it was for one unit<sep>Exactly. Not a nice way to handle your customers who made a real effort to be on time. Huge fail from both Avalon and WalletBit -- not any of it our fault. What do you expect, that I pay 1500 dollar while clearly both the store site and walletbit site are fucked up. Small payment should count as a placeholder and I want to know where I can send the rest of my money.<sep>Hey senseless, thank you for taking the time to maintain this list!<sep>+1<sep><sep>I\\'ve ordered 1, withholding my tx # though.<sep>Update: Order is completed with Walletbit and I have my confirmation (Full Payment).<sep>Ordered and partially paid for 1<sep>-<sep>Who made good order, write your batch number, plz.<sep>caoxg - 2 - 2013-02-02 15:18:17 - <truncated><sep>Clicking through to my order details in my walletbit history, I found the address and transaction of my payment to Avalon after my deposit <truncated> <link> <link> receiving address has received $ 57,260.47, starting with what are probably test transactions on January 31st: <link> has a final balance of $ 54,757.49.<sep>Batch Number 8837<sep>WalletBit says \"batch: 8829\"What, pray tell, is this for?<sep>My guess is that 88 is a reference to the new year, this being the CNY batch, and the last two digits are serial.

Avalon support replied me they will sent a emails with order information and others when they fixed all problem of yesterday. I guess they will send all emails with order details when all 600 unit sold.<sep>I sent an email to Avalon earlier this morning about completing the order after only having been able to pay the fraction of it yesterday. I quickly got a response saying I could go ahead and send the rest, my details having been logged with the site. I just sent the BTC for three and sent both Avalon and Walletbit an email with the details.Here\\'s hoping it all works out. Also that the queue proceeds with first to order, since I was the first to do so yesterday.<sep>I made a new order successfully today, and closed the support ticket. They can keep the \"placeholder\" payment, or refund it back to the sent-from address (I sent from my local wallet).Hope batch #2 goes smoothly from here on out. And batch #1 for that matter.New order: 1 - 2013-02-03 16:34:11 UTC - <link><sep>Two separate orders:darkip - 1 - 2013-02-03 16:59:04 - <truncated> - 1 - 2013-02-03 17:00:20 - <truncated><sep>I also ordered a second today, but I hope that it will be a different queue<sep>Coastermonger: 1 ordered and completed full payment via Walletbit.
