      "I have to wonder, 4GHz is fast, but in 100 days, will it mean anything anymore? I'm tempted to actually just buy 100 chips myself and then sort out manufacturing that into boards later. However at the same time I can't help but wonder- 400ghz, will that be worth it once the time comes? What do you guys think?I personally think that even with vastly increased diff, the difficulty will of course not increase exponentially. As long as you are buying next gen tech, diff will eventually plateau. If you look at diff/earnings historically I think the CPU/GPU boom is relevant. We are Just seeing the same technological paradigm shift from GPU-->ASIC. If you buy the latest generation ASIC now, it will earn you money as long as it is the latest generation tech available, just as GPUs did until ASIC started hitting the market.I think that is a pretty good way of thinking about it.\n",

Consider this: of all the miners/chips projected to come on line in 100 days ( bitfury, kncminer, avalon bulk chips, BFL, etc.), BFL is the only one that both has a working chip and is motivated by the fact that they will get the rest of their 50% payment on delivery. I believe that along with the fact that chips can ship directly from GlobalFoundries without being delayed within BFL's device manufacture chain gives BFL chips an edge over the others.\n",

Instead of waiting for the last chips to be pre-ordered, bizwoo could ask John K. to purchase them when the amount reaches 780BTC + John's fees (2%) => 795.6 BTC.This would be reached with 1500 chips at 0.08BTC + 2500 chips at 0.081BTC + 5770 chips at 0.082BTCbizwoo would take the risk of having to sell the remaining 230 chips at 0.082BTC (if I understood correctly he already plans to purchase 100 himself) in the weeks needed to produce and ship them to Europe but at the current rate of purchase this could mean less time waiting for the purchase to go through and more income for everyone including bizwoo.The sooner the target is reached, the better. If I can I'll probably invest in this myself in the coming weeks.Thank you for the suggestion. This will be perfectly fine for me.EDIT: Added order's status.Orders' StatusCurrent chips' price is 0.081BTCCode:ID No. Chips Total BTC     BTC Address     Total Miners                       Note----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1        12              0.96          1GeomABjUiEnCYcyUzB4wtVybFv9sgwB9A            0            PM -

Yes, you will have time to do it later, until 3 weeks after the chips have been ordered. ThanksHi kaziI will answer within line in blue.Hi I just have a couple of questions:I know that there is no guarantee that chips and miners will be received on time after the the group buy has been met, but:a) Have you imported and exported a large quantity of chips before?A. As far as I know no one has yet imported the Avalon chips. They have not shipped any order yet. Nevertheless, I have imported other electronic stuff before so I have some how experience in how it will work.b) What will the customs and duties procedure be?A. As I mentioned above, it is not fully clear how it will work with these chips. However, it is expeted that there will not be any import duties to be paid and the VAT in Siwtzerland is only 8%.c) What is the maximum amount of time before buyers can request their money back?A. There is no set time for this. Anyone can request the btc back at any time as per the Terms and Coniditons.Sorry if some of these questions have already been answered.ThanksI've sent BTC couple of hours ago + PM for 48 chips. Still I don't see my address on the list... or am I doing something wrong  Hi. The list does not update automatically, I am doing it only once a day to avoid flooding the thread only with updates. I will also answer all PMs at some point.

If Hashfast sells out of their first batch before then, then the money will be quickly refunded to the investors.* At nominal speeds of 400 gh/s, each share would be worth around 10 gh/s. Our unit will be in a 24/7 air conditioned room running at the max safe overclock speed, which might be around 500 gh/s or more. Their website says, \"Designed to be overclocked for greater performance  better than 500GH/s**\"* We will mine with the unit until it is no longer profitable -- at which time it will be sold on Ebay to the highest bidder and the profits will be divided among the investors, equally at 2.5% per share.* You will get your investment return sent to your bitcoin address weekly with a receipt.* There will be weekly pictures of the miner with a screenshot of its hashrate posted in the forum, weekly.* There is no hosting fee for this group buy. I have my own shares that I get enough money.* Message me if you want my personal information to assure trust.* We have a guarantee from Hashfast that they will give us 1.6 th/s more hash or 50 gh/s per share if we do not make ROI in 90 days off of our unit.* This is the only one groupbuy I am conducting, so I can manage it better than people with 5 or more group buys, which is common on here. Honestly, people trust them when they have 80-200+ people to keep satisfied. * serraz is handling escrow to purchase our unit. He is renowned member of the litecoin community. He is an op on btc-e exchange chat. He owns and maintains give-me-coins bitcoin, litecoin, and feathercoin pool with kha0s. He setup an offline wallet at 17EqnQZtfDQYKGdPesPKRzg9pQp76tzLvs because blockchain.info wallets are not safe. Make your payment to that address; then, send a encrypted private message or email message with your bitcoin address signature saying that you paid.  BTC.02 is the price included in the BTC1.09 price to cover the escrow fees. He will refund the whole BTC1.09 if the group buy fails. To be fair I am also giving him .4btc extra that is separate from any of the shares for his troubles. * If we do not make ROI in 90 days from shipment, then Hashfast will send us 1.6th/s more in chips. From my understanding, they ship the chips unassembled. Now, we have to work out what to do with the chips. For sure we will split the profits. We could invest it in using it for other hashfast machines or we could sell the chips by themselves. For putting the chips in use for other hashfast machines, we would have to make another commitment. However, for sure, we will split the profits if we sell the chips just by themselves to cover ROI. THEY ARE GUARANTEEING ROI!!!******* There will be a webcam setup to watch the unit 24/7 that you can checkup anytime you want. It would be like the miner were in your own home, but it would be in your monitor webcam program viewer.\n",

      "Okay, I have the escrow bitcoin address wallet from serraz. It is 17EqnQZtfDQYKGdPesPKRzg9pQp76tzLvs . That is his separate offline wallet address because blockchain.info wallets are not safe right now. After you buy a share by making payment, send me an encrypted message or email telling me that you paid for certain amount of shares. I made an agreement with him that there will be .02btc going to him per share. He will refund the whole entire BTC1.09 if the groupbuy fails. However, I told him he could keep an additional .4btc that I am paying out of my pocket and separate from that for his escrow handling troubles. There are only 19 out of 40 shares left to be sold before we can buy the Babyjet.ur0pl please do this properly. It is not in your or our interest to do things like this. I thought you are going to get a hero member (not necessarily John K.) as an escrow, but if serraz is your choice it is OK with me.1) It is not right that you post (unsigned) payment address instead of the escrow.2) Neither you or him have stated that you have sent him your passport scan with full personal details, and that he may post that here in case of any dispute. Edit: sending him your photo holding the passport will also be a good idea.3) Neither you or him have stated refund policy, i.e.: \"Refunds will be given immediately at any time before payment to HashFast is completed without the need for group buyer to explain the reasons for it.\"This is an example of usual escrow statement in a group buy topic:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=238321.msg2532445#msg2532445It has not have to be done to the point as John K. does, but would not hurt either. Please correct these formalities so we can proceed further. Thanks.I'll quote your opening post in the next message for the reference.As a side note:QuoteWe are sure to get enough ROI with bitcoin prices up so high recently.ROI has nothing to do with BTC price, we invest BTC - we get back BTC, if it goes to 1.000US$ or goes back to 10US$ has nothing to do with it if we will profit or not.I'm sorry. I just was unfamiliar with how to do things as this was my first group buy attempt. Unfortunately Hashfast has just today sold out of their Babyjet. I am sorry about the disappointment. I guess I started the group buy too late and should have started when they first opened shares\n",

      "I'm sorry. I just was unfamiliar with how to do things as this was my first group buy attempt. Unfortunately Hashfast has just today sold out of their Babyjet. I am sorry about the disappointment. I guess I started the group buy too late and should have started when they first opened sharesIt's OK ur0pl, we learn as we go. One train left the station, there will be others.I was looking to start group buy myself since electricity costs in my country are extremely low (around 0.085US$/Kwh), but the customs import fee is the problem and can go high, not like in the USA. I have to check with some accountant exactly how high. It didn't make sense for USA appliance (HashFast), but some Bitfury offers seem to be worth going through all these if there is enough interest. They are the only company that delivered some ASIC in time as promised, and this particular option is the one I'm looking into:http://www.bitfurystrikesback.com/product/400gh-miner-october-2013/The price in US$ is around 8.500 US$ which is much higher than HashFast, but early October delivery makes all the difference regarding the fact their 400Mhs miners are happily hashing all over Europe and where delivered to the day when promised (promised before September, delivered August 31th in quantity of hundreds, se that thread). Not to mention expected difficulty rise between their delivery date and Hashfast expected delivery which may compensate for the price difference. Let me know what you people think about all these.\n",

Once Ataxx comes with his 200 BTC the target is reached (and surpassed) and If people now decide to do the same as me, there's a limit of max. 200 BTC that can change hands. Under no circumstances should we go under 801.6525 again.\n",

      "There are at least 2 other GB around 1.5 BTC for 50 GH/s if we're talking about CoinTerra. The timeline just isn't worth itMany don't believe in the price going up again, or much.  If you get 10 times as much GH in a future where the difficulty is 10 times higher, then the devices that come sooner are only better until the cointerras come out.  Those who aren't in the cointerra game at that point will be behind.As more devices come out that are superior, I'll be staying in that game and getting those as well, letting all my buyers know which devices to stay on top of.  I also purchased part of an oct KNC, which beats the USB easily.\n",

Might want to up that rate for group buys in the future  Yep, lesson learned. I usually hold >50 BTC tx's at 1.5%, Avalon preorders at 2% for the length of time. Any group buys will need 2.5% from now on, and even more so if I need to handle PM's, questions and even customer service requests.\n",

      "Quote from: John (John K.) on April 27, 2013, 05:40:20 AMI want to buy 1 BTC worth. What is the procedure? Should I simply edit the sheet and then send to the address? Or do I pm JohnK? Also, in case I need it shipped outside US, when will the shipping cost be figured out and paid?Send the coin, post the TX ID. Only me and OP can edit the sheet. I will add you in the sheet. OP will ask for your address when the order is in, and figure out the costs later.Thanks for the reply. So I am sending 1BTC that will be counted for chips only?Yours plus OP's fees plus shipping would be figured out later? Or should I send 1.0744 to book 13 chips and that would be counted as having paid off fees, only shipping to be figured out later?Per the original post, the latter.  What will probably happen is this: Your total will be truncated at the chip and the remainder will be used for shipping.  This will leave us with a few unpurchased chips that were originally covered by this shipping balance, but that will be very easy to organize at the time.Nope, everyone will need to pay more for the shipping later on - the amount is not taken from the current balance unless stated when sending. (like the overpayments.)\n",

      "Hey John what so you think about ordering once we hit 782.1? Pretty much at that point we are just missing our fees. Contributions will still be opened to get to 801 of course but we can get the order in ASAP. Of course it would be risking not getting our fees but I firmly believe that it will fill up 801 btc. Worst case scenario we get more chips instead of btc! I think we should do it and order ASAP IMO!\n",
