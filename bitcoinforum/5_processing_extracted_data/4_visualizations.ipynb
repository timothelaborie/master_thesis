      "### Original post:\n",
      "So FPGA and ASIC seem to be the future of mining. With systems like the \"Rig\" from Butterly Labs, you have amazingly dense power per watt, however you still have a significant power draw. Who would be interested in pooling resources to acquire BFL Singles, Rigs or other FPGA or ASIC devices, and pack them into a secure server room with plenty of power. I currently have 1 BFL Single and it's fantastic. Along with a financial buy-in, I would be able to provide a secure server room with a minimum of 50AMPs @240V and dedicated cooling. What ideas, options or interest is out there? Add to the thread and let's hear it!\n",

      "That is not a dumb question at all and in fact you are right in thinking there may be an advantage, but it is complicated.The reason comes down to what happens at longpoll time. A longpoll occurs when the block on the network has changed. This is the time you are most likely to submit stale shares because you are working on the old block still when the new block is already spreading throughout the network. Furthermore, once the longpoll hits, you have to throw out all work and ask your pool(s) for more work so it is the time you are most likely to have a drop in hashrate while waiting for the new work (this is why the older releases of cgminer used to say waiting for fresh work).Now because cgminer checks longpolls from *any* pool you are connected to now, it can tell when the block changes on the network often faster than your primary pool finds out because you may be connected to the pool which discovered the block as well. So cgminer then knows to stop working on anything from that old block in anticipation that it will be wasted work. However until your primary pool discovers that the block has changed, you cannot actually get useful work from it. The beauty of longpoll, though<rest of post truncated>\n",
