My limited view is that it was Spondoolies that did that last time, though my historical recollection may be wrong. Avalon seems content to hang out on the fringes and not really engage in a \"pricing battle\" with anybody.

The company already relies on renewable energy sources to power our data centers with less than half of the energy overhead of the leading Internet giants, and continuously seeks new ways to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions. An important step forward in this effort is BitFurys deployment of its proprietary immersion cooling technology in its recently opened Tbilisi, Georgia, data center which supports 40 megawatts.*All figures mentioned above were measured with real silicon samples. Mileage for production devices may vary. Thanks to the physics of silicon devices, chips may demonstrate exceptionally low power consumption, or exceptionally high compute power, but not both at the same time.\"The bold is me.

      "Nevertheless, the unit has seen several cgminer restarts, and a few full machine restarts. Machine restarts seem to happen every 4-6 hours. Even ignoring more obvious means of restart detection (login and look at uptime, or ping-monitoring etc), a restart is a clearly audible event: At startup, the fans race at full speed for a few seconds, before \"calming down\" to a more moderate pace.jgarzik ,I am running my lancelot cluster on similar tp-link platform with 64M of ram. I am noticing the restart of my system because cgminer 2.10.4 slowly and steadily eats all of the available RAM about 45M. Can you just run now and then free and post the results. Probably some tweaks/patches are needed to cgminer.\n",

That makes a big difference to the earnings potential in the long run - but probably not for the next batch, unless BFL manage to deliver.Even at the US$0.25/kWh, $20 USD/btc and difficulty = 6 million (after 300 Avalon units have been added) you'll still clear US$108 per day. If BFL ships another 40Ghps and diificulty = 12 million, you'll still clear US$52 per day. You should still be able to make an ROI if the exchange rates hold.
