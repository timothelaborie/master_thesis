      "Those temps are HIGH. AMD only rates their GPU cores for 85C max. I would redo the thermal paste on your cards to lower the temps and make sure the heatsink doesn't have any dust in it. Doing both of these things on my 7970 lowered my core temp by 13C and my VRM1 (the VRMs that provide voltage for the GPU core itself) temp by 15C, and this is without a cure time.\n",

      "### Reply 3:\n",
      "My hypothesis is that one core gets the cool air from the fan, the other core gets the air that's already been heated by the first GPU core. Either way, it's still high. I'd set the fan speed to max at first, if you can handle the noise, great, leave it there. But monitor the temperatures first, and if you can't handle the noise, then slowly lower the fan speed, but keep it so that neither core goes above 85C.Also monitor VRM temps, those might be too high too. Monitor them with GPU-Z, which can be downloaded here. <link>\n",

I was thinking of something else...There might be dust in the heatsink, or too much thermal paste on one GPU core, explaining the difference in temperatures.Try starting GPU-Z before running cgminer and see if that works... if it doesn't, well, another way to monitor temperatures is HWInfo32 <link> or HWInfo64 <link> depending on whether you have a x86 (32-bit) or x86-64 (64-bit) operating system.

      "I've been GPU mining since early 2013 on and off, starting with a single Radeon HD 7850 video card, then multiple R9 270's during the Dogecoin boom, then with 200 GPUs (RX 570's and GTX 1060's) during the 2017-2018 ETH gold rush with help from outside investors. My business went bankrupt in late 2018 because a big investor pulled out after ETH started falling, we only got 200 cards instead of 1000+ so we defaulted on the lease, and I scaled back down to a single rig in 2019-2021.But now, with my regular job (software development) allowing me to work fully remote, I'm really interested in moving to somewhere with cheap-ish power and opening a small warehouse again. Since I'm currently in NJ, I thought about upstate NY first, but I don't like the BitLicense crap and state income tax, plus it's the middle of nowhere. I also considered NH/MT because they have no sales tax, but I'm interested in having a real life outside mining.

      "I 100% agree, of course GPU mining will live on, but right now isn't a good time to enter because of the threat of PoS. I definitely will get back into GPU mining when equipment is cheaper. My strategy is more long term.The problem with the AI/rendering compute services is: (1) there are few customers (2) it requires reconfiguring the rig, which will cost 30% more in equipment + 30% more in power per card.I was thinking that I could buy them in order to get to 100 kW as quickly as possible in order to secure lower per-kWh rates to prepare for the upcoming GPUs or newer ASICs, and especially to attract outside investors. I would sell the S9's for scrap after a year after they serve that purpose. I also think scaling to 100 kW will give me some experience with the construction/HVAC part.Should I move up to a slightly higher tier, like the L3 series, Innosilicon ZMaster or T15?I wanted to go with the day-ahead index, where I always know what the rate will be in 24h and it's not subject to instant spikes like the real-time LMP.

      "Yes; the day ahead pricing only applies to the energy generation, which is a competitive market. All energy still flows through the ONCOR lines. Here's an example during peak hours. If I can chop off just this 1 hour every day, it goes a long way. The S9's are obsolete anyway so I'm not worried about the risk of heating/cooling cycles.There's a chance I can't get day-ahead pricing. In that case, the energy would be a fixed 5.8.The only way to reduce the ONCOR charges is either higher uptime (higher load factor), or to not use ONCOR's transformers. I think it can go as low as 0.8 by taking power straight from the utility poles (5-20 kV), although I expect 1.8 in most small warehouses.\n",

      "I would think that an experienced GPU miner might be a little turned off to ASIC mining for a few reasons. ASICs tend to devalue faster than GPUs in my opinion, so while their volatile prices might give you more opportunities for profit scenarios, you have to be quick to act because you can be left holding worthless bricks in the end if you aren't nimble. There is also more dependency on a single currency, whereas GPU mining gives you added flexibility if one coin's price dips or something. You're also left with less usability for your equipment, so if regulation or market conditions causes ASICs to become worthless, GPUs will still have buyers in gamers and graphic artists.
