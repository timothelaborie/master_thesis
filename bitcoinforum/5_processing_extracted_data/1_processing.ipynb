If you buy 4 modules, you get a whole Avalon unit. The 60 modules to be resold now has only 42 38 left now.\"Are u selling the modules inside of the miners separately? \" Yes.

After the first Avalon arriving and before all them get to my house, the owner of this group order will be forced into a <truncated> contract.We designed the forced hosting to grab the golden mining window opportunity of every ASICs, and to make everyone in this group order feel fairly treated. As ngzhang announced in his Chinese post, the bulk order will be divided into small orders in shipping. So the 50 units may will be arriving between the middle of May and June. Without such <truncated> scheme, there will be huge unhappy discussion about who should get their rig first and who has the highest priority. In our scheme, every Avalon will be mining right after they arrives to catch the low difficulty. The owners of this group order will get the dividend proportionally. After all 50 units arrive, each owner can decide the shipping date of their own and no one else will be affected.\\n\\n### Reply 10:\\nThanks!Then when is the deadline? for buying a unit or module.\\n\\n### Reply 11:\\nBefore it is sold out\\n\\n### Reply 12:\\nYes.You mean I can still buy one module or unit if they haven\\'t been sold out, even when the units arrive and starts to mine?\\n\\n### Reply 13:\\nTheoretically yes, but I guess there will no module left long before that\\n\\n### Reply 14:\\nFAQ: FAQ1. What is the cost to have the modules host by you?Electricity cost: <truncated> fee: 10% of the mining revenue, the revenue is what the mining rig get from the mining pool.The hosting service will help Avalon users outside the China boarder to grab the first months window opportunity 2. After all the 50 units arrived, I can have the module/unit shipped to my house whenever I want?Yes, whenever you want.3. Will you overclock the Avalon to extract the potential?We will try and test on our own unit first except you ask me to test on your rigs. After we are confident about the overclock safety, we will email you and get your permission first to overclock the rigs. 4. How often will the mined bitcoin be distributed?At the beginning it will be weekly. Later it will be more frequently.\\n\\n### Reply 15:\\nPlease update your batch 3 order here : <link> if possible ?

I guess it will be start mining half an hour after we open the package I live in Beijing, China.Shipping will be DHL/EMS, cost depends on where you are. I have been in this community for 2 years long, among the board member of ASICMINER, no scamming excuse or warning from ngzhang/yifu, I guess they somehow knew the existence of my order As we need the money to invest other things, so no escrow accepted here.\\n\\n### Reply 20:\\nI want one unit (4 modules) but I may not have the BTC until Friday night...

I was thinking of making a dedicated account on a pool or pools and lock in the payment address. Then we could distribute the login to everybody in the buy-in. That way you could always check on the status and yell at me \"hey dumbass, the miner locked up - restart it\" As far as fair division - I used to invest a little with DeadTerra and he used to keep an Excel file. If you have a fixed percentage column and a running dividend (every week or month) it would be easy to have Excel just calculate that. Only payments would have to be done by hand, and if the group wants to they can assign somebody else to do that if I get too busy.As far as insurance my wife\\'s office is insured for over $250k, should be able to stick a miner in there. CoinHoarder will probably have to reassess his policy with those 7 units as that\\'s almost 50k of hardware.In the even of my untimely demise everybody can harass my wife (since she knows about my bitcoin madness).

Are you expecting everyone is going to DIY? This is not a simple matter. Soldering down 200+ chips is very tricky, chances are people are going to damage a significant # w/out the right reflow equipment.\\n\\n### Reply 7:\\nFor a price you can probably find somebody who will will take your PCB and chips and do all of the reflow work for you. Worth it for large batch jobs and tons of chips. Even for a single QNF8, the soldering would be a pain. There are some of us who have some experience with PCB design. I myself have quite a bit, but not too sure where to start with these ASIC chips at the moment. Has Avalon released documentation for them yet?\\n\\n### Reply 8:\\nBest I can tell not yet\\n\\n### Reply 9:\\nDocumentation is what I\\'m waiting for. I\\'m not going to invest in a set of chips that I may not have the hardware or steady hands to build. I always start with an initial design and a simple BOM before I even bother dropping the money. I know the guys over at the DIY ASIC Build thread have come up with some concepts, but considering nobody really knows anything about these Avalon chips yet it is probably mostly educated guesses, which I\\'m fine with. I\\'ll have to read more and see if any of them found anything. But I will have to see if I can find a place to do batch jobs with a reflow oven. I just want my own, damnit.\\n\\n### Reply 10:\\nAt work (where I am an EE doing PCB design), I or my assembly ladies routinely solder down QFN-28 + thermal pad packages (careful use of a hot air gun). With my current order (12 chips), if I plan on making the PCB myself, for myself, I\\'ll probably go this route. If I find that there\\'s interest in my board on this forum (as I\\'ll also be doing microcontroller firmware and PC interface also), then I\\'ll probably open up a service where I do a batch assembly order (for BTC!). I would imagine theres a bazillion others on this forum planning on doing the same thing though. So it might end up that I just use their services.Once Avalon releases the necessary information (essentially an app datasheet for the Avalon processor), I\\'ll likely be developing applications for single chips (\"just plug it in to USB and go\"), 4 chips, and 10 or 12 chips (depending on data bandwidth scalability of common 32-bit processors). Again, I would imagine many people on this forum are planning the same. Lotta bright people round these parts.But for now, we\\'re all just salivating over the idea of the Avalon processor app note/datasheet.\\n\\n### Reply 11:\\nIf you do that, I\\'d be interested because any amount of simplification in building the system will make it worthwhile in the long run. Once I get those datasheets I\\'m going to designing throughout the night!samurai, do you primarily use Altium or Eagle? I\\'m fond of Eagle, but I\\'m getting into Altium as I like a lot of it\\'s routing features. Eagle to me was like fighting with..well..an Eagle. Haha.\\n\\n### Reply 12:\\nI \"grew up\" on OrCAD 10 through 15, which had tons of bugs and quirks but was powerful once you knew how to work around them. For the past 2 years I\\'ve been using Eagle at work and home. I have not had the chance to use Altium, PADS, Pulsonix or others. Altium seems to be the de facto standard these days, but seats are SO EXPENSIVE.I\\'ve gotten used to hand-routing everything anyway (used to do a lot of analog design), so Eagle is fine for me. Luckily I haven\\'t had to do too much <truncated> lines, and what I have had to do I\\'ve just calculated/routed by hand.\\n\\n### Reply 13:\\nThat\\'s nice. I wish I had used Altium for my RF projects. I always ruined the trace width in Eagle, since I couldn\\'t group a set of traces to change the width on the final product at the end of the day would have different traces and impedances per line. It was awful. I like OrCAD, but I think it has terrible part integration. I can deal with Eagle more than I can OrCAD, which I just use for simulation.\\n\\n### Reply 14:\\nI do all my work in gEDA - gschem and pcb.\\n\\n### Reply 15:\\nSo we send to John? Or to you OP?

Let\\'s get this thing pre-ordered first.Once everything is shipped to me you can decide on whether you want the chips to be shipped to you directly or to Burnin. If you want it to be shipped to Burnin you have to sign his contract or what not.Keep in mind that I am also gathering members to form a team that will develop ASIC miners with these chips as well. We are currently following the DIY thread closely. It\\'s a bunch of local engineers that I\\'ve been contacting. But like I said that\\'s all in the near future. We have about 2-3 months before we actually get the chips but I am gathering info and talking to people now. Let\\'s get all the BTC sent to escrow\\'s address and then we can discuss about the shipment and what you plan to do with the chips.\\n\\n### Reply 18:\\nI hope you realize that zefir\\'s group is now on their 4th batch, right ? So, even if you are able to make this batch order before zefir\\'s 4th, there are still 3 orders of chips before yours reaching burnin (divide that by whatever percent you want, but I would think it would be very close to 90% than 50%).\\n\\n### Reply 19:\\nSeconded. Although burnin looks to be shipping 500 boards a week (5000 chips); so he\\'ll probably move them pretty quickly; especially if the chips can make it directly to him from those of us who would like him to assemble the boards. There\\'s us and zefir so the total number of chips shipped to burnin probably won\\'t go over 10,000 (assuming even half of both orders ship to burnin). I\\'m expecting about 3-4 weeks turn around (total) after the shipment is paid for arrived. Seems quicker than waiting in line for a BFL.\\n\\n### Reply 20:\\nAhh.

This is no easy task: ask to BFL, bASIC or also Avalon. Just check their machine, what they did to the TP-LINK router, they had to tweak it for it to work as desired, and that means TIME for TESTING.And you know in this game TIME is everything.

Otherwise, when the units won\\'t work, he won\\'t know WHY.Thus, if you don\\'t have an electrical engineer with deep experience in mining BTC with FPGA\\'s leading your project, you will also make your \"group\" to incur in heavy losses, as you won\\'t be able to have working units for MONTHS. Again: ask to BFL.Yeah, you can count that the documentation from Avalon will be PERFECT, that you will be able to easily replicate their machine with that documentation, finding all the components (among which a modified TP-LINK router that is only distributed in China) very fast...

I just can\\'t wrap my head around spending this much for so little hashing. I mean from my perspective - I\\'d make more money buying a bunch of 7970s and reselling them for 75% of purchase price in a couple months.ROI is what... ~6 months? So make that 9 after the 30% increase in difficulty that\\'s coming. I\\'ll think about it some more.\\n\\n### Reply 7:\\nCan you really get 75% from a mined out vid card? That\\'s an honest question, actually, since I simply don\\'t know. After seeing how miners run these things I would not touch one with a 10\\' pole as a buyer for actually running a monitor. As for mining, it seems GPU mining is going the way of the waterbuffalo even at today\\'s BTC prices. I suppose there are always alt coins, but still I just cannot wrap my head around someone paying 75%.\\n\\n### Reply 8:\\nI\\'ve sold used 7970s for anything from 300 to 350. That\\'s not when \"everyone is selling\" them though.I think the key thing here is power usage. If you have expensive electricity, these will pay for themselves quickly if you swap em with your 7970s. And they\\'ll generate profit longer. However, once difficulty gets really really high, you\\'ll be stuck with unsellable items. Your call as to whether that works for you or not.M\\n\\n### Reply 9:\\na 7970 mining + reselling pay for itself in 2 months(you even make profit lol), much faster than anything else, right nowthe mathbuy at 400, mine for two months=220(minus 120 bills), sell at =350total=450\\n\\n### Reply 10:\\nStep right up and get your sticks...\\n\\n### Reply 11:\\nI am interested in this as well. At least one, maybe up to 5. I\\'ll have to buy some BTC. Question? After you order what is the time to ship? Are we looking at weeks or months to I get this in my grubby little hand?\\n\\n### Reply 12:\\nGreat! You did say Avalon though? My question was more about ASCIMiner, I didn\\'t see what their projected ship date is? Do you happen to know?\\n\\n### Reply 13:\\nI intend to get these out to people no longer than 1 day after I receive them. I\\'m going to have everything ready as far as labels and boxes and packaging material and will be ready to ship immediately upon receipt from ASCIMiner. For example, if the delivery gets here in the AM, I have till 7 PM to ship as many as I can that same day. if the shipment gets here in the afternoon, I\\'ll probably finish shipping the next day. I will have help to repackage and ship out so this won\\'t be a 1 man operation.\\n\\n### Reply 14:\\ntypo. fixed.\\n\\n### Reply 15:\\nDamn, I was totally ready to pony up BTC10.1748 for 5 Avalons, lol .

Hopefully we can meet soon enough back in Romania and have that beer we were talking about ! . Firstly, and excuse me if I missed it reading up on the group buy, but can you offer us invoices?Secondly, Can you offer us a secure way of shipping the chips? i.e an insured shipment in case of damages, or lost packages( I realize that the chances are slim, but still)Thirdly, I must admit, I have a sick mind, but this is a business and I need to protect my(others) investments.Have you considered hiring personal guards while picking up the chips? I\\'m sure everybody including me would be happy to chip in for extra security measures to make sure everything goes smoothly. I know this might sound absurd and I am indeed a bit paranoid but this is a legitimate risk that we need to take into considerati<rest of post truncated>\\n\\n### Reply 4:\\n@OP:Small nagging request: could you please put the thread updates newest on top (i.e. reverse chronological order) so the freshest news are seen first.

Or a 64 chip miner?\\n\\n### Reply 7:\\nAre you planning to make 32 chip ones? Or 64 maybe?Is the PSU included in the price?I hope you are going to receive -> build -> ship also, i don\\'t know if electricity in romania is so cheaper than somewhere else, talking about ASICs. Maybe i can send you my GPU, that would be nice\\n\\n### Reply 8:\\nWhat\\'s important is the K16, the 16 chip design, because it will be daisy-chained together with other 1-3 boards to get to the 32 / 64 chip miner. The nice thing is, that if you connect them through the special connector, you will use only one USB port.\\n\\n### Reply 9:\\nSzia, Ham.1. I won\\'t be able to give out legal invoices, because i don\\'t have a company. In Romania (and not just here), it\\'s a real pain to have a company and have all kinds of government people knocking on your door, asking for their cut from the business income. As i\\'m not sure how constant this cryptocoin hardware business will be, i must admit i don\\'t wish to have a company just yet.2. About the secure shipments, i assure you that you will have the option to ship with insurance and via express services. It only depends on how much are you willing to pay for your shipment.3, About the bodyguards... I believe in security through obscurity. Please feel free to look me up and try to find my address if you\\'re at it. PM with your search results. In case you do find me, i will be hiring bodyguards. Although, i won\\'t be going alone to the customs to pick up our batch and i won\\'t be going unarmed. But still, who am i? Just human... So i\\'m waiting for your results [EDIT: ROFL ) ... i\\'ve shocked myself with FINDING myself and my full address.

Can you show us pics of more than just the 2?\\n\\n### Reply 1:\\nAbsolutely. I received a couple other PMs about this, allow me to explain (this was originally in my OP, but it seemed very lengthy and I edited it to be a bit more brief). I first ordered one from Canary last week, then upped it to two. Almost immediately after paying him, I decided I wanted more than that, and that I wanted to order directly from friedcat. I kept my order with Canary in the hopes that I might get a mix of colors (I\\'m trying to get all four!). If you read more into that thread, you\\'ll actually see that, oddly enough, Canary has not even received that group buy yet (based on his tracking status, I expect him to receive it today). I received my order Friday and am ready to ship a lot of units. I assure you if that\\'s your reason for not trusting me, it\\'s unfounded; I have not received any units from Canary and the hardware in my pictures is from my own direct order. I\\'m keeping many for myself, and have been \"testing the sales waters\" by selling the remainder for immediate shipment.

I\\'m hesitant to continue on that site until I hear some good feedback or I get my money! Support has not responded yet.\\n\\n### Reply 11:\\nThis! A million times - this! I don\\'t want this thread to turn into a debate about profitability, preorder predictions, is BFL a scam, etc - the whole point is that if you want this product, I will ship it to you! What good is even discussing ASICs like the jalapeno if it hasn\\'t shipped? I\\'ve had tens of thousands of dollars tied up in preorders (including jalapenos!) for now nearly a year - trust me, I\\'m just as frustrated. I could have used that money and invested in ASICM at the same time and be a millionaire right now. That\\'s the whole reason this thread exists though, to cut through the bullshit and make a very straight offer - a real physical ASIC in your hands as early as tomorrow for a fair price.And if you can put a batch of jalapenos in my hands to sell in the same manner, I\\'ll put them in inventory and sell them too!\\n\\n### Reply 12:\\nThanks for the explanation and the new pics!

I have some questions and I\\'ll try to be quick about them.1) Does the cost per chip (0.083) cover the escrow fee or we should add 2% going to 0.08466 per chip?2) The price of the PCB (including components and fan) for 16 chip devices is 85EUR. Will you be accepting PayPal as a payment method for PCB and Shipping costs?3) Are you offering any kind of warranty for the finished product (16chip device)?3) What is the total cost of KWh where you live? What are you planning to charge for hosting the devices? And what currencies and payment methods do you plan to accept for that?John, does your escrow service cover the slim possibility of Steve running away with the chips or someone stealing them from him? (No offense intended Steve.)Summing Up details not mentioned in OP, for convenience16chip device details (based on Klondike project) - Fully functioning device (tested and ready for mining)- Cost: Chip cost (1.328BTC) + 85EUR for board, assembly and fans (no PSU) + Shipping cost (20-30EUR depending on destination) + POSSIBLE TAX outside EU.- Performance: The device is guaranteed to perform 4,2GH/s- Connection: C<rest of post truncated>\\n\\n### Reply 3:\\nThank you,order confirmed.

In case the chips get damaged during use, it will or will not be covered by warranty. In this case, we will decide what to do and how to replace your chips. I personally do not have my own chips, as i have given them up to the two last persons in the first batch.

Since the minimum number of boards has already been reached, buyers can count on the option of receiving ready to mine boards.You could make it more prominent in the original post, with links to the Klondike thread and even the case design thread. I wouldn\\'t have pre-ordered here without an option for a Klondike board, the exchange in the forum between BkkCoins (designer of the board) and other users make it clear to me that his project has matured quite well. This will be a well thought out and tested design before the chips in this group buy will be mounted on the board.I have a question though: is it advisable to purchase a little more chips than needed for the boards (16/board) in case of chip malfunction? More precisely, will there be an opportunity for tests and chip replacement in the case of chip malfunction after board assembly and before shipping? BkkCoins seems to have designed the board in such a way that one chip malfunction doesn\\'t bring the whole board down but I\\'m not sure of the various failure modes and if they make spare chips a good idea.\\n\\n### Reply 1:\\nHi gyverlb I will follow you advice and try to add more info in reference to the miner assembly using the klondike design in the OP.In reference to the chips, AVALON said that the chips will be delivered fully tested and functional. Therefore, to be honest, not many people has been ordering more chips to be used for replacement in case it is needed. As you mentioned, BkkCoins is designing the board to tackle chips failures; nevertheless, he is still in process of prototyping and therefore we are still to know the final result.

Not only did he reply to PM\\'s while he was running around from his phone. But at one point we actually talked on the phone as he was trying to get my order sorted out. He then went out of his way to get next day air shipping taken care of for me and even repacked the miners (I think, maybe they weren\\'t packed yet) to make them fit into a smaller box so my shipping costs wouldn\\'t be so much. Kudos to you sir! If you were thinking twice about using him to purchase one ... think again Kosmokramer is a stand up guy and as many have posted his stuff does ship and is packed well (my first order from him will be here Friday, yes I made another) and he goes out of his way to make it right. So I tipped him... he didn\\'t want to make anything off the shipping but DAMNIT HE DESERVED IT! This is what the Bitcoin community is all about.

The next stop is LA after that, but there is usually a whole host of status updates between HK and LA, none of which I\\'m seeing. This means either it missed its flight to LA tonight, or the previous tracking statuses don\\'t update until it lands in LA (around 3am PST).

What do you think the chances are they will deliver in under 100 days? I think your going to waste your time. They won\\'t go for it and this whole thing is a total waste of time for everyone involved. And this whole escrow thing will just tie up everyones money.

If they let out a few hundred thousand chips they will dilute the value of the existing orders greatly and their customers will revolt. (Like what is happening with BFL.)\\n\\n### Reply 3:\\nThe way I calculate it, it\\'s a 6-7 month breakeven point at current diff and we all know what is very likely to happen to diff in the next 2-3 months. I wish I could see how these units make me money because I would love to buy a couple dozen. For me ASICMINER priced the unit too high.Good luck with the group buy guys, being a GTA born and bread boy myself I wish I could support you a little but doesn\\'t really make sense to me at this point!\\n\\n### Reply 4:\\nI will order 10 units as soon as I figure out how to change cash to BTC.My friend just configured 10 units, it makes 3.3GH/s !!!\\n\\n### Reply 5:\\nYou can go to LibertyBit to exchange cash to BTC.What I do not get it, though, is why these items are still profitable.With 0.35 GH/s, one can make (optimistic estimate) 0.4 BTC per month, and it is going to exponentially decrease due to the increase of the hash rates. So, it takes more than 5 months to simply recover the purchase price, even if difficulty remained constant. Even 1 BTC would be a risky price to pay for these items. Think before your buy!<link>\\n\\n### Reply 6:\\nI am not a businessman, I do it for fun! I built 2 computers as mining rigs and bitcoins are the excuse to spend money on computer hardware and have fun (I just finished and all setup costed me $5000 - but fun is priceless)\\n\\n### Reply 7:\\nGood for you! You are lucky to belong that minority of human kind who can spend $5,000 on fun. But most people here at least want to break even, if not to make some profit. The problem with the devices offered for sale here is that the odds of breaking even are quite low with the current pricing.I further note that if they were so profitable, they would not be sold, but those who already have them would use it themselves.\\n\\n### Reply 8:\\nYou are quite right about both observations. The question is whether it is profitable to buy these devices today. This is what I very highly doubt, and I am trying my best to caution others from being carried away by the prospects of revenue without adequately considering the costs and return.You see, what you sell has quite a bit of potential to break even or bring only very small profits after it breaks even, because the difficulty rate increases exponentially, and with more ASIC, there is no reason to assume that its growth will change.\\n\\n### Reply 9:\\nI don\\'t drink beer and I don\\'t smoke - here comes $5000 easily. Anybody can do it.\\n\\n### Reply 10:\\nI find it very sad how insensitive you are toward poverty and those who are less fortunate than you are. While you may not have had the experience of not having money to buy food, others did, and there are many people who starve not because they are lazy or alcoholic or smoke.\\n\\n### Reply 11:\\nSo, you are promoting a product at a price that is not economic, and that those who buy it have a fair chance to lose money on. Why are you doing it?\\n\\n### Reply 12:\\nin the early days of iphone apps, there was an app called \"i\\'m rich\" or something like that. it did nothing but display a picture of a gem, and it was something like $1000 to buy. the guy managed a few sales before apple yanked it.what\\'s being promoted is a piece of electronic equipment. whether the price is economic, or whether those who buy it \"lose money\" (or, more accurately, fail to make money) is irrelevant. is the sale of a cd-rw drive irresponsible if the purchaser will never sell enough copied discs to get his money back? to double his money?you\\'re assuming that the end users are only in it for the money, and that the group buy organizers are preying on the gullible. the organizers assume nothing about the end users\\' intentions, and are simply helping people who want to buy these devices get their hands on them. are some people buying these in the hopes of getting rich? perhaps, but isn\\'t it their responsibility to check?\\n\\n### Reply 13:\\nMost people do not by CD-RW for selling pirated CDs, but rather to back up their own data. Moreover, the cost of a CD-RW is not comparable to the price for these devices.I do not question the right of people to waste hundreds or thousands of dollars of their own money if they choose to do so.

As for identity confirmation, I have no problems whatsoever showing my identity to John or another trusted member. We decided against escrow because it\\'s expensive and doesn\\'t really prove anything.

As for the last question, running with the dividends, there is no way we can prove we won\\'t do that unfortunately.. Which brings us to the most important risk, being that we also don\\'t know that KNC delivers on time or at all. We took that chance ourselves (so far with a lot more money than in this groupbuy) so you could say we trust KNC.

It does however introduce another thing; currently we charge 60BTC for a miner and we\\'ll calculate the difference in BTC/USD in september. We did this to keep it simple in terms of share value and at the time the actual price was 60btc.. The last two miners we bought cost 64BTC. If we use his group buy we would have to start paying 70BTC per miner. Which means we would have to raise the current share price since that would be a bit to much to front.Lastly, the interest timer on that group buy has only 18 hours left and there\\'s only been shown interest in 5 machines so far (of which one is yours 2weiX?):<link> for the tip though!Cheers,\\n\\n### Reply 6:\\nyeah, trying to convince him to not cancel the whole thing.trying to sell 80 machines within a couple of hours - dont think so.\\n\\n### Reply 7:\\nMight actually be good for us if his order is cancelled..

Do the owners of that Jupiter pay up, or is the risk spread? If the first Jupiter is set up and shares go directly to the shareholders in precise sequence, then it would be unfair later to pool the returns if that Jupiter was faulty or had down-time for a few weeks or longer. Spreading the risk across machines might therefore have its advantages especially for those with a larger share in any 1 particular machine. Something that might affect the decision is the precise pre-order slot of each Jupiter. If they are bunched up together very close 65-85, it is going to be less of an issue perhaps. But then again, if there is a top 10 order slot in there somewhere...\\n\\n### Reply 25:\\nOk, I\\'m having a change of mind hereThe pool win or fail mentality is probably fairer in the event of Downtime / failures / repairs etcAnd I did originally buy in to an X/360 share schemeSo as more come on line my share is worth more and if we have a failure / downtime / maintenance window, I do not singularly foot the bill.And it probably easier for sonic to manage it as a pool as opposed to working out / cataloging who owns what bit etc....\\n\\n### Reply 26:\\nEven though in 1st on the list I do agree with this, Having a larger pool will spread th<rest of thread truncated>\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\nReply with the hardware names, all in the same line, separated by commas.

[USA]\\n### Original post:\\nWhy is some of the trust feedback not going in the trusted section? Anyone know? WHOOT I HAD THE BIGGEST TRUSTED ORDER... is that good? Or am I chasing a pipe dream because they will never ROI? WHO CARES VIA LA BITCOIN! VIA LA KOSMO!Naelr\\n\\n### Reply 1:\\nGranted, I just discovered the \"trust\" tool a few days ago, but it\\'s my understanding that trusted feedback is from members who are already in the elite pool of trust in this community. For example, OgNasty is one of the trusted members around here, and he made a comment that I served him well, so they separate his comment from yours because perhaps his carries more weight, as he\\'s a very trusted user.Untrusted feedback is still good, but it doesn\\'t carry as much weight as trusted. I could get my family to create accounts here and say as many warm and fuzzy things as possible about me, but it would all, justifiably, go under the untrusted feedback section.This is the trust network: <link> As you can see, Og is pretty high up the hierarchy, so we value his opinion. I saw Tomatocage call out a scammer yesterday - he is pretty good at that which is likely one of the many reasons he\\'s in that trust pool too.\\n\\n### Reply 2:\\nMy feedback was posted as trusted.... on yours and arklan\\'s trust post pages... hmmmm I GUESS I AM A TRUSTED MEMBER! GO ME!\\n\\n### Reply 3:\\nI\\'m seeing it under untrusted, no?\\n\\n### Reply 4:\\nI am looking at your trust page and I see only 2 under trusted ... Me and OgNasty... weird!\\n\\n### Reply 5:\\nhere is what i see\\n\\n### Reply 6:\\nOk, well that makes sense. When you look at someone\\'s trust profile, they separate the feedback you\\'re reading based on who\\'s opinion YOU trust (or who\\'s opinion they, be default, think you should trust) and who\\'s opinion you may or may not trust (untrusted). So they suggest that you trust OgNasty\\'s opinion of me and clearly you can trust your own opinion, so they both appear under \"trusted\". It\\'s the same with me - when I view your trust profile, my feedback for you appears under \"trusted\" - because (hopefully) I can trust my own opinion of you.Just saw the pictures you posted - looks like it arrived in perfect condition!!\\n\\n### Reply 7:\\nThen perhaps, I don\\'t know how it works or maybe I\\'m not understanding what you\\'re seeing.For reference, this is what my trust page looks like to myself.\\n\\n### Reply 8:\\nyes sir it arrived excellent and I met the driver at his truck.. thanks for working with me on the postage and thanks for you dedication to making it all go smooth. The pic was a nice added touch! Sorry it was blurry I didn\\'t notice until I posted it.\\n\\n### Reply 9:\\nI\\'ve got some exciting news guys! I was able to work with BitMit support to change my weird user name (d500blahblahblah) to match my bitcointalk name! Less confusing - yay!In addition, I provided them personal information, including my company\\'s business license/articles of incorporation and I am now a verified BitMit seller! Pretty exciting!I\\'ve been trying for some time now to work with BitPay to get my sales website up and running, but they are just ridiculous. I don\\'t know what I\\'m doing wrong, but they won\\'t give me the time of day. Meanwhile, Joachim at BitMit is bending over backwards to help me clean-up my seller profile, change username to match BT, same-day verification, answer questions, etc .... although BitMit\\'s fees are much higher than BitPay, I still prefer them due to outstanding customer service.Very exciting and just wanted you all to be informed that I am now \"kosmokramer\" on both sites ... and verified! I\\'d love to gain \"trusted\" status on this site, but not sure what the steps are to do that. Does anyone know?\\n\\n### Reply 10:\\nBOTTOM LINE I TRUST KOSMO AND SO SHOULD YOU. Maybe I should put pics of 20 shipped miners on here!Believe me I am happily hashing.one of 2 opened box of 10 (the other isn\\'t mine to open)There be little miners in them there boxes....\\n\\n### Reply 11:\\nI fixed my pic!\\n\\n### Reply 12:\\nStill trying to get a BitPay account to better serve you guys. I posted on reddit hoping to get a bit more feedback on what the hell the secret is. Would appreciate upboats if any of you are redditors. Thanks all!\\n\\n### Reply 13:\\nSad to see BitPay doesn\\'t seem to know what is going with your account. Sounds like you have been more diligent than their support team!\\n\\n### Reply 14:\\nGot the little guy in the mailbox today. Plugged in and running with (almost) no trouble. kosmokramer ships fast.\\n\\n### Reply 15:\\nPurchased 6 from KosmoKramer... two paypents of 12.6 and .6 for 13.2 <truncated>\\n\\n### Reply 16:\\nPurchased two from kosmokramer and got them in perfect condition two days after I ordered them. Also, most entertaining packaging ever.

Why not communicate here on the forum like we have been doing ?Same applies to Google Docs, do we really need that ? Google already knows way too much about us...And besides that, I haven\\'t been able to see the document yet, don\\'t know how to open it since I have no link to it.Sorry if you think I am too negative, but that\\'s how I see it.\\n\\n### Reply 4:\\nAnd the question about the power supplies we will need.

(17 being refunded)Also bear in mind that the longer you leave it, the higher the chance you would be left on an outstanding order, so roll up roll up, don\\'t miss out etc. Seriously, I think Soniq has worked hard to secure investment for all the outstanding shares, so I don\\'t think it will happen anyway.\\n\\n### Reply 13:\\nAgreed.As dividends will be paid pro-rata this should be applied to <truncated> <truncated> costs (eg. BTC0.07 per share for PSU purchases).Just on the topic of PSU I suggest we calculate if it\\'s worth buying a hot spare (eg. BTC0.005 per share for an additional unit) to avoid downtime in case of failure.\\n\\n### Reply 14:\\nNot too negative, you raise an awful lot of good points!\\n\\n### Reply 15:\\nReally? We can\\'t use the forum as it\\'s not private. PMs wouldn\\'t work well either, as everyone would have to respond to everyone etc.This fact makes the other points moot.As for Google, if you sent Soniq your email address then he will have mailed it with the sharing link.Just add that mail address as a google account address (no name, address, shoe size etc required).I understand most Apple users have been spoon fed functionality thus removing the need for anything technical beyond topping up an iTunes account, but it\\'s not hard.(Disclaimer: That last bit was a joke btw, I know there is a difference between Mac user and iPhone/Pad user, and mean no offence)\\n\\n### Reply 16:\\nHi,You can usually get quick BTC at <link> carried out a few transactions there and you can usually buy within 10 minutes or so if doing a bank transfer* - just make sure the seller is <truncated> - assuming you are in the UK and both banks use faster payments.\\n\\n### Reply 17:\\nHello,I\\'ve purchased 1 share <link> - Am I too late?\\n\\n### Reply 18:\\n10 shares in, <truncated> sent\\n\\n### Reply 19:\\n1 sharepaidCode:ID: <truncated>\\n\\n### Reply 20:\\nThank you for your contribution, added to OP10th Jupiter purchased\\n\\n### Reply 21:\\nI don\\'t see it in OP, can you check please?

Time to make the money back\\n\\n### Reply 2:\\nHi!Do you have any left?Tom\\n\\n### Reply 3:\\nWhy the F hasn\\'t this thread been moved to the for sale forum?\\n\\n### Reply 4:\\nYes! I\\'ve reviewed my incoming shipments and I have plenty to cover more orders. I haven\\'t counted it all up, but I\\'d say I\\'m 60-70% sold ... however, the pace isn\\'t really slowing down. I\\'ve been sending quotes/invoices and collecting shipping data all morning, and am still far behind. Boy am I glad I started accepting orders before tomorrow - there\\'s no way I would have had time to process all of these orders if I hadn\\'t started accepting a bit early today!This should always be true: If BitMit says I have some in-stock, then I have some in-stock.\\n\\n### Reply 5:\\nNeither you nor I are the only re-sellers in US. I can assure you that there are others who have sold more than you and I combined.\\n\\n### Reply 6:\\nThe thread was started here because I happened to see that this is where all group buys for the same hardware showed up. Apologize, but I was just following suit!I believe you\\'re referring to the \"marketplace\"? It looks like that\\'s more suited to one-off sales of random this-and-thats. In comparison, I\\'m a direct reseller for ASICMiner and deal in the hundreds. Personally, if I was looking for new, bleeding edge, mining hardware to purchase, I would come to \"custom hardware\" (in fact, I have, several times) ... while if I was looking for say liquid nitrogen, well, I wouldn\\'t expect it to be here.\\n\\n### Reply 7:\\nLikely true, but I sure couldn\\'t find anyone who stocked them when I wanted one immediately!

When that be happening?\\n\\n### Reply 9:\\n+1Not sure why but this \"Custom Hardware\" subforum has become \"Custom Hardware - Buy/Sell, preorders, group buys, preorders of shares on preordered products that might or might not be ever produced\".Now it is a junk subforum, KNC pre-orders, shares on pre-orders, 1.9TH PCI cards, Nigerian/Indian asics etc, hard to find any technical info on the actual products.All is missing is options on future forward contracts on Avalon/BFL dates or any other events related or unrelated to bitcoin. Pre-order \"hash rate swaps\" anyone? Total madness.PS. I have contributed to this with my small group buy thread.\\n\\n### Reply 10:\\nI think keeping this thread in custom hardware is rather important to the community.

Working great, thanks A+C.Running them with rPi and powered USB2.0 hub. They do seem to generate some HW errors, but doesn\\'t seem to affect hashrate. I have a fan blowing air over them, so the aluminum heatspreader isn\\'t too hot to touch. Don\\'t know about the little chips on the other side, though...When the last 3 arrive, i plan to attach them to a large heatsink i have, which has enough surface for all of them. This will require extension cables for the Eruptors, but that doesn\\'t seem to be a problem as i mined few hours with all 3 on different length cables (longest is about 2 meters long)Then again, they mined equally well without any additional cooling, so i\\'m wondering what the thermal specs of these actually are. But extra cooling will give always mean longer life span, so extra cooling it is.\\n\\n### Reply 9:\\nFor those who received it, did you have to sign anything when you were delivered?I used my office address, which is closed on Saturdays, and the tracking tells me it was delivered today. That leaves only two options, someone at my office is working extra today and signed for it, or they just dropped the parcel in the box without anyone signing for it.Thanks for your answer!\\n\\n### Reply 10:\\nWhen it was delivered here I did sign, the airsure sticker on the package however states \"No sig req\"\\n\\n### Reply 11:\\nI had to sign for mine\\n\\n### Reply 12:\\nI\\'ve been trying to use:--icarus-timing shortinstead of:--icarus-timing 3.0=100It seems to be giving me a little more speed: about 335 MH/s instead of 334 MH/sThese options are explained in the file FPGA-README in cgminer source code.The \"short\" options basically finds the timing by calculating it and periodically adjusting it in the first hour it runs. You will see a message in the log about these adjustments every once in a while if you try it.The \"3.0=100\" is probably a safe timing that works fine for every unit. The thing is that all sticks are not exactly the same and some units might be able to cope with a slightly better timing value.\\n\\n### Reply 13:\\nI finally managed to get cgminer 3.2.1 to work with Debian 7.0 !

Sadly, with rPi, mining ends very soon and all devices are shown as zombies... works on Debian though.

I tried all the editing, demon reloading and everything, no dice.I noticed there was a new version of MinePeon dated 7/6/13, so I re-wrote my SD card with it.

Start mining this week!!\\n### Original post:\\nFresh inventory has arrived - see OP for revised ordering instructions.Order now and your miners ship out first thing tomorrow morning!!Testing an order to Canada tomorrow so if that goes well, expect more international shipments to come!Now to start packing these little guys for their new homes...\\n\\n### Reply 1:\\nThanks can\\'t wait to get mine soon\\n\\n### Reply 2:\\nAnyone know the story with BitInstant still not accepting cash? Is this typical of their service?\\n\\n### Reply 3:\\nThat would be me. Thanks kosmokramer! Can\\'t wait to fire them up.\\n\\n### Reply 4:\\nWow - BitInstant is back and better than ever! The reports of their death were greatly exaggerated\\n\\n### Reply 5:\\nYup. I was getting worried. Now I just have to go give the cash to Walmart and I\\'ll be ordering an Erupter this afternoon!\\n\\n### Reply 6:\\nAlright guys - lots of packages went out today! Thanks so much for placing orders far in advance yesterday - even still, two of us were up until about 6am opening, testing (two duds), re-packing, packaging, labeling, taping ... the whole works. Running on fumes now.I may end up changing some of the shipping cutoff terms to make life bearable. Right now I\\'m moving the sun and stars trying to make sure your shipments go out same-day if at all possible, but as more and more orders go out every day, that\\'s becoming harder to do. I\\'d prefer to have everything ready for shipment the night before, say by 8pm, so I can do this all in assembly line format for a few hours and ship in the morning. Essentially, if you order within (slightly extended) business hours, your order ships out next day.I\\'ll try to settle on some new terms and update the OP in the next day or two. I do have a (pretty flexible) full-time job, so the only times I can hit it hard are evenings really. Doing my best to keep up and I feel so far I have! Keep coming back here with feedback.First person to post the new artwork this week gets a bit nickel!.\\n\\n### Reply 7:\\nNews on shipping to Germany? should be ~20$ish (USPS flat rate box)\\n\\n### Reply 8:\\nAre these Blades, Emeralds, or Sapphires?\\n\\n### Reply 9:\\nSapphires\\n\\n### Reply 10:\\ni have a few over from my GB, shipping from germany\\n\\n### Reply 11:\\nOrder placed! Fingers crossed for a Saturday arrival!\\n\\n### Reply 12:\\nLooks good so far. Shipped the same day as I ordered. Got tracking and it looks like it\\'s scheduled to be delivered in 2 days.\\n\\n### Reply 13:\\nSeveral very large buys this morning have nearly wiped out inventory. Hoping to have more soon, but the last is up for grabs on BitMit.After packing erupters until ~4am again, I\\'ve determined revised shipping terms:Orders placed before 8pm (PST) will ship out the next business morning. Special exceptions may be made to this for larger orders or customers who tip With a full-time job, it\\'s quite difficult to receive an order at noon, process/pack it, and make a second trip to the post office just for that order. I just have to create a cutoff point at sometime and 8pm gives me time to process orders for a while and still get some rest before heading to the post office in the morning. Of course I\\'ll still make an effort to ship everything out as soon as is possible, but these revised terms should help to set clear expectations for everyone.Have a great hump day everyone!!\\n\\n### Reply 14:\\nFound your thread\\n\\n### Reply 15:\\nExpected delivery June 15th. C\\'mon USPS, don\\'t let me down!\\n\\n### Reply 16:\\nIs Priority typically 3-days to your location? I\\'ve seen an average of 1-day to 2-day delivery with these units, but then again, if I recall correctly, you\\'re in a bit of a unique location?\\n\\n### Reply 17:\\nYeah, it\\'s pretty much always in the 3-5 day time frame. But since you\\'re West coast I was hoping for 3 days.(I should have waited for your sale though )\\n\\n### Reply 18:\\nAs soon as I have it I will post pictures!

I\\'m not ready to commit to either until we actually see confirmed designs (and recommend others hold off too), but they\\'re both quite <truncated> I\\'m liking the idea of Burnin\\'s \"Double Density\" option, which puts 20 chips per board, and is scaleable with multiple boards. It\\'d be awesome to be able to just get some PCB prints, and have the boards built for a group shipment here in the U.S. and then assembled by the end users. I\\'ve got a local hackerspace shop that probably has a decent reflow station. I might have to join up and get these things assembled there.\\n\\n### Reply 9:\\nAssuming we have the schematics and complete gerber files, I have a source that can assemble and fabricate in a matter of days to a week. I will hopefully have more info on this shortly.\\n\\n### Reply 10:\\nDefinitely let me know. Every second counts in this race. If my math is correct, and we assume 10 batches of chips shipping in the next 10 weeks (which I think is probably a low number), that\\'s 28.9T/hash coming online by mid-july, JUST from avalon chips ordered so far.That\\'s gonna SKYROCKET difficulty in really short order. He who mines soonest wins.\\n\\n### Reply 11:\\n10 batches aka 100k chips? I think people had posted evidence of 500k chips being bought?\\n\\n### Reply 12:\\nI haven\\'t seen any hard numbers, and I don\\'t know if anybody really has. It\\'s all just speculation, but like I said, I was going with a conservative number. It could easily be a million chips, for all we know.\\n\\n### Reply 13:\\nIirc the \\'proof\\' was like 45,000 btc being moved. It was damn close to the number for 10k chips x 50\\n\\n### Reply 14:\\nExcuse me for the probably stupid question but how do you use these chips?Sure, i\\'d buy some but once i have them what then?\\n\\n### Reply 15:\\nI\\'m working through the same process now - there\\'s a lot on the first group buy that talks about different people who will be offering their services to add these chips that you can buy to PCBs... it seems like an awesome idea but have lots of reading and catching up to do before jumping in as far as I can tell.\\n\\n### Reply 16:\\nRight, i\\'m gonna read the other thread. Didn\\'t realize it was there. Came from an outside link directly to this thread.\\n\\n### Reply 17:\\nAnyone have any suggestions on how to attract more people to this group? Would love it if we could get our goal by next week.\\n\\n### Reply 18:\\nragingazn628, I got into the end of the last group buy (with admittedly a low amount,) could I still get in on this one or are you excluding previous people?

I have no doubt that several mining builder options will be available before delivery date (100 days from order at the latest).\\n\\n### Reply 2:\\ni am interested in 2 shares maybe morebut i feel more comfortable when i know we have a working pcb or something\\n\\n### Reply 3:\\nI totally understand that, problem being that when PCB is available I assume the chips to be sold out already. Look at Avalon. No proven PCB yet and 500.000 chips sold.\\n\\n### Reply 4:\\nHow do you propose distributing the chips to participants of the group buy? The chips in a lot of 100 from BFL are not all the same:\\n\\n### Reply 5:\\nThere are 2 possible scenarios: 1. The chips arrive unmarked/unsorted leaving me no choice but to send chips 100% randomly. Since only 5% are class-D a random selection should leave everyone with well over an average of 4 gh/s in any 5 chip batch.2. If the chips arrive marked with quality/class I will simply send owners as close to the split of chips qualiy provided by BFL in the product statement.\\n\\n### Reply 6:\\nThat sounds fair\\n\\n### Reply 7:\\nIt\\'s impossible to accurately predict what the ratio\\'s will be in any wafer. Wafers vary from one wafer to the next.BFL\\'s first (working) wafers had tested as 1.76watt per GH/s then later they realized alot of other chips were anywhere from 2 to 6 watts per Gh/s.With that kind of volatility you never know what you will get.\\n\\n### Reply 8:\\nOh I am fully aware of their history, though they do guarantee 3.2 w for chips ordered, and since the numbers posted are Global Foundries specs it seems a lot safer then BFL estimates.\\n\\n### Reply 9:\\nI have to wonder, 4GHz is fast, but in 100 days, will it mean anything anymore? I\\'m tempted to actually just buy 100 chips myself and then sort out manufacturing that into boards later. However at the same time I can\\'t help but wonder- 400ghz, will that be worth it once the time comes? What do you guys think?\\n\\n### Reply 10:\\nI personally think that even with vastly increased diff, the difficulty will of course not increase exponentially. As long as you are buying next gen tech, diff will eventually plateau. If you look at diff/earnings historically I think the CPU/GPU boom is relevant. We are Just seeing the same technological paradigm shift from GPU-->ASIC. If you buy the latest generation ASIC now, it will earn you money as long as it is the latest generation tech available, just as GPUs did until ASIC started hitting the market.\\n\\n### Reply 11:\\nI think that is a pretty good way of thinking about it.\\n\\n### Reply 12:\\nI bought 100 chips from BFL. Consider this: of all the miners/chips projected to come on line in 100 days ( bitfury, kncminer, avalon bulk chips, BFL, etc.), BFL is the only one that both has a working chip and is motivated by the fact that they will get the rest of their 50% payment on delivery. I believe that along with the fact that chips can ship directly from GlobalFoundries without being delayed within BFL\\'s device manufacture chain gives BFL chips an edge over the others.\\n\\n### Reply 13:\\nany updates regarding a working pcb for the chipsJosh released the chips specs and it can be downloaded from butterflylabs forum.\\n\\n### Reply 14:\\nsave some money with coupons<link>\\n\\n### Reply 15:\\nIf i buy a coupon, how will i be able to use it if i cannot buy 100 chips from BFL as far as i know they require 100 minimum chip order\\n\\n### Reply 16:\\nmaybe the group buy organizer can consider to incorporate the credit coupon and reduce the cost?\\n\\n### Reply 17:\\nI am looking into the possibility for using chip discounts for this group buy.\\n\\n### Reply 18:\\nif we can get the voucher discount that will be awesomeand i can buy couple shares\\n\\n### Reply 19:\\nI have contacted BFL reg possibility of combining chips for purchase under 1 account. I have almost enough for the entire 100 chip purchase myself but would like to see if we can\\'t combine a few accounts and maybe make the group buy larger, or at least have the option to do so.\\n\\n### Reply 20:\\nAll necessary schematics and software for producing miners using BFL chips has now been released. See original OP post for info.\\n\\n### Reply 21:\\nwould there is a price drop accordingly\\n\\n### Reply 22:\\nYes. Actually, people that have chip credits can show their interest here and if it looks like we can fill at least 100 chips I will re-write the group buy to take into account chip credits, and also publish info on credit transfer with payment info.That<rest of thread truncated>\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\nReply with the hardware names, all in the same line, separated by commas.

Regardless thanks for taking the time to get back to us.Anyways, may I ask who will be assembling boards and where it will be done? Are they engineers, computer techs, hobbyists? How many people will be working on assembly at a time? Is the expected turnaround still about 2 weeks? Is $130 a near final number, it seems slightly steeper than the majority of board assembly services I\\'ve seen, what sets yours apart.I apologize if this feels like an attack, I assure it is nothing of the sort, I would just like to hear more about the project. I\\'m wary of sending money anywhere too quickly. Due diligence pays tenfold.Cheers G!~Ben\\n\\n### Reply 2:\\nHi Ben,The boards will be produced in a professional assembly house, by trained people who know exactly what they\\'re doing. Because the assembly etc. is being outsourced the operation will be highly scalable, so there should be very little lead time to make chips into hashing miners (most likely under 1 week if you choose to overnight all the shipping). The $130 mentioned above will very likely be the final number, although you should not count on it yet. There is always the possibility that the board designs do not work and we have to go with a more costly board design (and that goes for all of these ASIC projects), although this is extremely unlikely. What I believe sets me apart from other services, is the increased likelihood of a fast turnaround. I will be producing boards for 10,000 chips before this group-buy order arrives, so I will be able to familiarize myself with the process and hopefully make a bunch of clients happy Best,GarrettPS:I couldn\\'t agree more!\\n\\n### Reply 3:\\nHello garr255, I\\'ve sent you an e-mail, waiting for a reply I\\'m jesse11 here and the e-mail will come from me, techjesse\\n\\n### Reply 4:\\nReplied, thanks for the inquiry.\\n\\n### Reply 5:\\nreceived reply.

You will all be the first to know when I have more in-stock.I\\'d like to make a comment about resellers - I had hoped I was providing this hardware to end users for a very fair price in order to get more people into mining at a reasonable cost. It appears many of the units that I sold are now being resold for a significant markup. While I know there\\'s nothing I can do to prevent that, it is a bit of a let down to see such high prices on hardware I worked so hard to keep affordable. Really glad to see you\\'ve all been happy with my service - that is always my number one goal and I don\\'t intend for that to change! Whether it\\'s ASICMiners, raw chips, or potato chips, hearing you say you\\'re happy is the best reward there is; especially when it comes to something as historically disappointing as ASICs. It\\'s been an honor to serve you all so far.\\n\\n### Reply 1:\\nActually, just so you don\\'t feel so disappointed, if you look closer you will find that most of those are out of the US - many in the Netherlands shipping only to the Netherlands.

Now she only wants to buy from you since her group purchase of 15 of them ended up on a rather sour note, and we still don\\'t have the units, but paid for them many weeks ago.I\\'m supposed to ask - what are you selling now/next ? She\\'ll buy some...\\n\\n### Reply 2:\\nI\\'m waiting for a response from ASICMiner. I believe they are getting more of the USB block erupters manufactured, but I have not heard back yet about an ETA.

I expect there to be a wide array of DYI projects and miner manufacturing offers well in time for chip shipment though. It took avalon DIY projects just a few weeks from chip announcements to release spec for Klondyke and k64, I would be very surprised if the same is not true for the BFL chips especially since there are sample chips floating around and it is very much in the best interest of BFL to release specs to boost chip sales.\\n\\n### Reply 2:\\nHow much is it now for the Grade B through D chips? (Any specs released by BFL on those grades?)\\n\\n### Reply 3:\\nThey lowered the price across the board and are now only guaranteeing 4 GH/s instead of using the \\'hand picked/per chip\\' approach.\\n\\n### Reply 4:\\nI don\\'t understand what that means.4Gh/s guarantee even for Grade D chips?You have to explain it to me or get Josh to clear this up.\\n\\n### Reply 5:\\nFrom what I can tell ALL chips are guaranteed to run at 3 GH/s+ according to: \"Chip grades: Chips come in four grades of performance. Chips are sold in mixed grade lots. A grade has 16 engines, B grade has 15 engines, C grade has 14 engines and D grade has no less than 12 engines. All chips run at a minimum of 250 mhz. Higher grade chips will run up to 294mhz. The percentage distribution in each lot is 60% Grade A, 20% Grade B, 15% Grade C and 5% Grade D.\" from link @ <link> each chip has a minimum of 12 cores, IF a chip happens to be of lowest quality (12 cores) and also of the lowest clock speed @ 250 mhz it would run @ 3GHs. Though I find it unlikely, since my guess is that less cores, would allow a chip to dissipate more heat and likely run at close to or at the highest clock speed of 290 mh/s+ giving even class-D chips around 3.4 gh/s. Best case scenario would be a chip of class A with 16 cores @ 294 mh/s running at 4.7 GH/s. Since chip distribution is 60% Grade-A and only 5% grade D it seems exceptionally unlikely even with a 5 chip order that the average hash rate would come out to less than 4 GH/s. It seems statistically even a random selection would produce OVER 4 GH/s.\\n\\n### Reply 6:\\nI have previously hosted 2 separate group buys for KNC and Bitfury miners that both closed successfully (fully subscribed) within 24 hours of opening. I am considering a new group buy of the just announced BFL 65 NM, 4 GH chips. They sell in minimum quantities of 100 chips @ $75 per chip (See. info: <link> )The group buy would likely be set up as a 5 chip minimum @ around 0.8-0.9 BTC per chip. I would \\'charge\\' around 10% for administration of the buy (In BTC or Chips), and shipping/handling of chips and most likely the management of turning purchased chips into functional miners once PCB designs/specs are available and DYI projects or build services are available. I would also update the group buy with possible DYI or professional building of miners when available. Chip delivery is in 100 days according to website (Delivery directly from Foundry, which makes delays less likely. After all we are dealing with Butterfly labs here and anything that removes delay factors is a positive). If you are interested, post here and I will likely launch the group buy within the hour so we can be the absolute first to receive chips. NOTE: THIS IS BRAND NEW PRICING and the first group buy at this p<rest of post truncated>\\n\\n### Reply 7:\\nA couple of questions:How can they give us info on what the spreads are of Grade A through D if they haven\\'t yet fabbed the new chips? (Isn\\'t it 100 days away?)Or are they giving us the old lots they already \"have\" fabbed that are meant for pre-orders? (The ones with power problems)\\n\\n### Reply 8:\\nAre the chip lots marked clearly as Grade A, B, C, D or are they selling them blindly and we get what we get?How do you guarantee we will get Grade A if we pay 75$ per chip for Grade A? (Instead of Grade D\\'s mixed in)\\n\\n### Reply 9:\\nI would probably purchase 25 chips. Would you consider accepting escrow for the 50% not due until delivery?\\n\\n### Reply 10:\\nBFL is not charging $99 for Grade A chips (their original proposal). They are charging a discounted $75 per chip for a mixed batch so they don\\'t have to sort them. They are not labelled.\\n\\n### Reply 11:\\nAre the ratio\\'s of Grade A\\'s to D\\'s at least guaranteed?It would kinda suck to end up with a ton of Duds.\\n\\n### Reply 12:\\nI guarantee nothing reg. Chip quality that BFL has not stated. The process I would use would be blind where I ship a random amount of each grade (based off BFL % for Grade A-D) by simply packaging and sending chips without myself knowing the grade (I assume that BFL will send them un-marked). If chips ARE indeed marked I would select chips for each purchas<rest of thread truncated>\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\nReply with the hardware names, all in the same line, separated by commas.

Currently we can host 80 chips per controller, between five hashing cards of 16 chips each.

They\\'ve already got several 100s batches ordered and are watching this thread.I, personally, find the fact so interesting that the power consumption of the chips is rather low and that heat dissipation won\\'t seem to be the main problem. So wouldn\\'t it be possible to put the boards for example next to each other and only use passive heatsinks? Or at least a heat-dependent fan that operates very silently. This could be a great opportunity for people who like to keep their mining quiet\\n\\n### Reply 1:\\nseems your the only European Group Buy and your accepting SEPA thats great\\n\\n### Reply 2:\\nPassive heatsinks are probably not possible. You still have 16W12W per chip. One would work 2 probably not unless is BIG and you can forget about more. For 4 you need to take away 64W48W. That is midrange CPU... And that are our cooling planes... Cheap CPU coolers... They are not that noisy. We might add auto speed control at later date to the board but current plans do not include it. But if you have other ideas we will not stop you buying it without heatsink.About other GB. Yes you will be able to buy just board or send chips to me for mounting but not before our costumers get them. They will have hi priority and other costumers will be low. If GB fails to get at lest 100 chips boards will not be made and all collected money returned. So let get first chips onboard ASAP.EDIT: Bought too many AVALON\\'s chips so I can\\'t buy more them 8 at the moment.\\n\\n### Reply 3:\\nThere could also be 1-chip sticks. This would allow for very small boards (like an USB flash drive). They could use a passive heatsink and 15 Watts should be manageable by using an active USB port.The ASICminer Block Erupter Sticks are very successful... Although they only got 0.3 GH/s! 4GH/s chips could be quite powerful in comparison.\\n\\n### Reply 4:\\nDamn, you\\'re right. I did the math a few days ago but I guess I got some numbers wrong... This is difficult with only one USB Port!\\n\\n### Reply 5:\\nWe did look into this idea. But you would need more then one port to powering it... Really impractical... Getting 15W+ in pieces of 2,5W is 6 USB ports... And it would still be BIG for USB key... I would be interested if you have any practical idea how to get power from computer... Or active USB hub... I can only see added brick for powering it. Far from simple USB flash drive...EDIT: It would probably be cheaper and more practical to buy 1 chip and one board. Probably even 2 chips with board. But then again those ASICminer Block Erupter Sticks were also a rip-off.\\n\\n### Reply 6:\\nHi LuckoRelative noob to all this.

Waiting for payment... Slowly but surly...\\n\\n### Reply 8:\\nHi!Lead time should be 100 days from me ordering it. But this is BFL so you never know...When chips are received you have 3 options:1. get chips only2. get boards fully assembled with or without chips3. get hosting(read first post under hosting)But for 183 total cost you will probably not get the board and one chip. You need more. I would recommend minimal of 4 chips. For now this is just a estimate:chips 4*65=260$ (assuming you buy credits for 10$)board 200$Power supply 30$Total 490$VAT 22% total less then 600$(you are EU)That is for 16GH+It is only 60W so it will not heat you more then a llight bulb and it will not be too much noise...EDIT: If you need credits and don\\'t know how to get them I can get them for you.\\n\\n### Reply 9:\\nIs maybe not being clear.

I need more hours in a day The klondike16 are testing the prototype and have already noticed some minor power failures that need to be corrected in the PCB.For case for many units I\\'m working with a atx computer case with power 750W corsair modular this can support 15 units with OC. The maximum capacity of the case is 18 units, but keep in mind the power supply.A quick scheme of what I\\'m working. 5 modules of 3 units with heatsink for three units also.Smallest box I have to see what order maybe 4-5 more plates.I have already ordered components for 3 prototype, there are some problems with the microcontroller stock, but I searched compatible alternative.Regards\\n\\n### Reply 16:\\nFor only 1 unit the aluminium heatsink will be 90x90x35mm.

Cooling the chips isn\\'t really a big issue (use a waterblock CPU cooler), but you need to make sure the design doesn\\'t cause other parts of the board to overheat and catch on fire.TLDR; There\\'s a bunch of engineering work that still needs to happen before a community BFL board becomes a reality.\\n\\n### Reply 5:\\nYou are right, I didn\\'t realize they haven\\'t/won\\'t release longboard specs.

The miners in this groupbuy might even be further improved..We expect that the first 3 miners in this groupbuy will definately be send together since order numbers are pretty close.

SebastianJu <link> batch 6: 1998Thanks to ujka for the list (<link>\\n\\n### Reply 14:\\nI think it will rise quite fast once first chips are delivered to any group buy. Because we already know the chips exist, miners from developers seem to be working, so everyone (who still has some money to spend) is waiting if the 9-10 weeks of delivery will be true or not.\\n\\n### Reply 15:\\nSome say all the current batches will be delivered together.So, it would be 9-10 weeks for the first batches, much less for the last batches (e.x. #5).But then, probably for batch #6 it would be 5-10 weeks again...\\n\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\nReply with the hardware names, all in the same line, separated by commas.

But in case KNC\\'s hosting costs are prohibitive, we can elect to host Jupiters ourselves and have them shipped.If KNC hosts the Jupiters then there will be no shipping. If they do not host, then there will be shipping.Repairs are standard on any computer hardware, nothing runs forever.

So quoting my brother and me 12 more BFL chips along with needing chip credits. We paying in BTC. He in USA is where boards will be shipping.We will buying 12 more chips per week until having enough so group buy can be going. You will giving us great deal on PCBs and assembly for this doing, no?We most interested in 4 chip 16 Gh/s boards modular/stackable, but 1 or 2 chip single might be interested if cheap enough. Whatever is putting chips to work hashing sooner is what we are wanting.\\n\\n### Reply 1:\\nDon\\'t worry big buyers will get some discounts... And we are looking how to make boards to your liking It is a small change so I think we can accommodate you...And since we have 120W power supply on board(50% more then BFL that was realised) I\\'m getting more confident in saying that 6 chips will work. Maybe even 8... But I\\'m afraid of the fact that BFL had problems that they didn\\'t see. It is same chip so why did they had them? But theoretical max for this board should be 10 chips but it has only place for 8 chips...\\n\\n### Reply 2:\\nBoard with 8 chips sounding pretty awesome, let\\'s get going, yes?If board having own power supply, not so necessary to allow for stacking. Whole point of stacking was to allowing single PSU to be powering 8 boards using standard modular PSU and standard cables. And how big *is* board? Power supply building onto board will needing very large caps and inductors, no? Is big supply to be making 5V @ 24 amp, yes?? Everyone else using separate standard PSU for good reason - isolation of switching noise from rest of circuit and besides single PSU cheap. Components to building ones own big stable switcher 8 times for each one of 8 boards maybe not nearly so cheap as one PSU powering same 8 boards. And you really wanting to be in board business, not PSU business I thinking. And board will be needing 8 heat sinks and fans? One on each chip?\\n\\n### Reply 3:\\nIt is not like that. I was talking about 1V power supplay. Chips are runing at that voltage. So you would still need 12V of PSU...Heat sinks. One for all. If we go to 8 per board(96W) you will need GPU cooler or hi end CPU cooler for sure. 6(72W) would it be posible with good CPU cooler and 4(48W) is any CPU cooler... So the board has 24W additional power just in case with 8 chips. You might use it for overclocking if there will be no suprise... I\\'m looking how in add this in the system... But for now I will say only that I\\'m sure it will run with 4 chips but on paper it should run with 8 overclocked...\\n\\n### Reply 4:\\nBoards will have connector allowing for CPU cooler to attach? Could easily use low end water cooling system like Astek 510LC if so. Using same on my overclocked 6 core AMD CPUs and is working sufficiently. Those CPUs running at 100+ watts. Maybe separate into two 4 chip groups?Ok excited to get order bought and boards done. I happy with 4 chips, running SOON.\\n\\n### Reply 5:\\nFrom what I see Astek 510LC should work...4 chips groups(like K16) would take more space and make more complicated board. The way we are going you will be able to \"make\" K16 like board. You will need 2 power and communication modules and 4 chips modules... Not sure if you will need 1 PCI-e or two per set of 2 boards jet... depends on number of chips. But since we also need 5 V in there there is a chance you will need molex (or sata) and PCI-e... Need to look at PSU out there to see if this will be a problem...\\n\\n### Reply 6:\\nMost designers including K16 taking just 12V and using various regulators/down convertors like IR3847MTR1PBF to be generating other voltages.<link> not be difficult to getting 5V 250 ma off 12 V supply, if that primary need for USB.\\n\\n### Reply 7:\\nYes but if you need more Watts than one PCI-e cable is recommended to be used then adding another or something else is a good idea. And if you need 5V you can take it of PSU molex connector that gives you the rest of the W on 12 V needed...\\n\\n### Reply 8:\\nOne my rigs having dual 7970 cards when hashing mode cards pulling 400 watts each. That being supplied by 2 PCIe connectors off 1.3k watt PSU for each card. That meaning 200 watts per connector or 12v at minimum 15-16 amps. Board needing more than 200 watts??? Not especially wanting all different connectors. Having PSUs with 6 or 8 PCIe connectors. Should be running 6 or 8 boards, yes?\\n\\n### Reply 9:\\nBut you are using 8 pin and 6 pin right? And I think you don\\'t get full 400 W. Anyway. I was looking at my 30 PSU that I used to have in my miner... Receomended load 150 per PCI-e... So if we have over 75W on one side you are OK but if it will work with 8 chips you are not. But then it might be just this cheep PSU... I need to look at some others...\\n\\n### Reply 10:\\nThe difference between 6 pin and 8 pin is just two extra grounds...<link>\\n\\n### Reply 11:\\nYes but still it helps.

I saw mention of a 100mm square circuit board, but the nearest fan sizes are 90mm and 120mm.Bob\\n\\n### Reply 3:\\non avalon store the chips are out of stock!!when and how they will order?\\n\\n### Reply 4:\\nHiYes, this is already known by Group Buys organizers involved in the joining initiative. We have not decided how to proceed yet, but we will most probably extend the closing time if the AVALON store does not become available by tomorrow. Until this moment everything continues as planned.Cheers\\n\\n### Reply 5:\\n<clalulu>; <32>; <2.624>; <2>; <nekonos>; <truncated>\\n\\n### Reply 6:\\nHi bobsmith652We do not offer electronic components separately. I think klondike BKKCoins creator will offer the possibility to buy the board and components kit.The problem with a oven is control the temperature.Control of temperature and time at various temperatures is important for good soldering. Some people make reflow oven with toaster wih ir.For soldering paste you will need also a stencil.Heatsink will be 90x90x35mm but it depents with the final case. Some manufacture make also 100mm fan.Regards\\n\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\nReply with the hardware names, all in the same line, separated by commas.

We will close this groupbuy once the 7th miner\\'s shares are sold. We are paying this miner to KNC ASAP. We managed to raise some extra funds ourselves to buy some more shares on miner 7 so 106 shares are sold already. In short, only 134 shares left on this groupbuy.What we will do however is start a new groupbuy with the same conditions as this one (unless btc/usd keeps going down ;-)). Only difference is we won\\'t be paying the miners first but pay for it once the miner is sold in shares..

Thank you for your orders!\\n\\n### Reply 1:\\n$25 for shipping 1-10 to Canada and no tracking? Thats absurd. Talk about price gouging. Why no tracking? It should cost between $10-15 to send 1-10 of these to Canada from the US and still get tracking with USPS. Something is not right with that pricing.\\n\\n### Reply 2:\\nBetter look up your pricing from US then via USPS PRIORITY MAIL. <link> $19.95 No Tracking Available<link> $40.95 Tracking AvailableIf a different group buy has a better price, please buy it there.

I will reply in 13 hours when I get off work.\\n\\n### Reply 8:\\nCoinbase can actually verify your bank account instantly if you give them your bank login and password (for most banks). It will still take a week to actually get the bitcoins that you bought though. That amazes me in the 21st century with an electronic currency.\\n\\n### Reply 9:\\nI have sent BTC1.25 for 1 unit with shipping included to Canada.

They charge a small (1% I think) fee plus a small bank fee.Just checked, for 1 BTC ($90.23) they charge $.90 Coinbase fee & $.15 Bank fee. That\\'s it. But, once you\\'re verified, it\\'ll take a week to arrive. Cashing it out is about 2x as fast, however.\\n\\n### Reply 14:\\nOk. Thank you.

Only 150 available (and AsicMiner is still temporarily out of stock). Please get your order in sooner than later so you won\\'t be disappointed. I have a few international forum members interested in around 40 miners each. First come, first served. I will be starting another group buy immediately following this one. However, I can\\'t receive a payment address until new stock for the next group buy is available. Also, an announcement MAY be coming in the future for an USA exclusive reseller agreement(not talking about myself, I would like to be ONE of their resellers in the USA ). If so, I will try to work with that exclusive USA reseller to get the best prices for all group buys and auctions I plan on conducting in the future. Thank you for your support and interest!

They accept cash deposits at several of the major banks (Commonwealth bank is their bank, use that for fastest transfer) but one problem is that for the first deposit it cannot exceed $100 AUD, but 7 days after the first deposit they increase this limit to $500. Their fee is 2% which is better than 5.9% on your suggestion and also the turn around time if deposited at a commonwealth bank seems to be usually 1 hour (it was for me too).

This is an exiting two weeks for the board development. If everything goes as planned, which we are extremely confident of, our final board revision will be hashing in two weeks! We are ready for mass production, with the sourcing for parts revised (some power regulators were getting too warm for comfort, so we went with some higher-duty ones) and completed. We are opting for superior components because these boards will be sold with a one year warranty, covering board and component failure entirely but not end-user abuse or Avalon chip failure, because both of those variable are out of our control.Once I have verified that the final revision is perfect and ready to go, I will open up an order form for these boards. For those of you new to the project, these boards will be overclockable to an estimated 350mh/s per chip, as opposed to the ~270mh/s per chip that other producers are offering.Since Avalon is accepting orders for chips again, I will open up a batch 2 tonight. Batch 1 chips are still for sale, but at a large premium because of how early the order was placed (early May) and I\\'d like to keep some for myself as well Further updates, pictures, and videos of the f<rest of post truncated>\\n\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\nReply with the hardware names, all in the same line, separated by commas.

And the power to run it? And the redundant internet connection? And the space where all the stuff is placed?

We feel we can only start groupbuys on which we are willing to invest ourselves, in this case the numbers tell us we don\\'t want to..To start with, the current BTC/USD price is certainly not helping. It just dropped to $70 or 55. So below numbers might have been a lot better a few days or week ago.We\\'ve compared the two 400GH options offered. In our own calculations for KNC we\\'ve used 31/10 as delivery date for the jupiters. Likewise we\\'ve used 31/8 and 31/10 for possible delivery dates for bitfury.The prices in BTC for the miners used are:KNC Jupiter: 100 BTC (we bought a lot cheaper, but that\\'s the current price)Bitfury October: 136 BTC (7500/55)Bitfury August: 272 BTC (15000/55)With an average difficulty rise of 14% per retarget period these are the break-even numbers in days:KNC Jupiter: 105 days, top is 115 BTC after 217 days Bitfury October: never, top is 127 after 245 daysBitfury August: never top is 192BTC after 287 daysFor power we took ,67btc per week for the jupiters and ,33 for bitfury (half).

At least it\\'s only 20% in the UK!I guess ROI for all of these depends on where we think the bitcoin price will be in the future.

VAT can be an unpleasant surprise..There\\'s just a lot of factors to take into account. In the spreadsheet we use, i took difficulty as the major variable, so every column has a different difff from 0 to 30%. In the rows are the earnings per week. It became pretty difficult lol.. All in all difficulty is the most deciding factor on roi. We\\'ve seen difficulty go up by more than 20% lately. Last period was a nice one with only 10% but the next one will probably be around % again..We\\'ll see what happens I guess\\n\\n### Reply 15:\\nI have access to next to free electricity. Only problem is GST (equivalent of VAT) is 7% into Singapore.I can get it shipped to a friend in the UK and then ship it into Singapore.I understand that there\\'s a groupbuy for BitFury miners at the moment and they are reserving 13% + electical costs.Would anyone be interested if I started one for 10% while covering electrical costs?Is there a kickstarter type collection service where people pledge amounts and aren\\'t required to transfer till we have enough to go ahead.

At 13% you earn something like $2700 in month 1 alone, to cover \"management\" (not including electricity!), then incrementally smaller payments from there. There is already a pretty big premium on group A, and trying to make our way back to a profit at 87% payout rate could be daunting.

The benefit is a little more security, but the downside is a little more cost for the GB + slightly more complicated admin (i.e. we will need to be in good contact with John K. to ensure that components are ordered as soon as possible when enough funds have been gathered).

I\\'m pretty sure that you would be able to sell more share with a guarantee of this kind, and IMHO it doesn\\'t \"break\" your privacy because John K. won\\'t disclose your ID unless you run away with shareholder\\'s money\\n\\n### Reply 1:\\nHi Matt,Early on if I was not able to sell shares, I would have paid for verification services by John K. But at this stage, the units are almost complete and I\\'m down to a low enough shares available that I am willing to keep them all if no one else decides to purchase. Also a lot of the folks who purchased have actually dealt with me or currently working with me in one way or another. I am confident that they do not have any second thoughts as to my intentions. Charles\\n\\n### Reply 2:\\nCharles,Thanks for your answer. I just saw that you had not sold any share in 10 days, and I also saw the reaction when I posted in the mentioned topic, so I was just suggesting something to help you sell shares.If you\\'re okay with the number of shares that you sold already, it\\'s fair enough for me Cheers\\n\\n### Reply 3:\\nThanks Charles, Just transferred for 1 ShareTX ID = <truncated> Receiving address = <truncated> get this 2nd unit paid\\n\\n### Reply 4:\\nActually it\\'s already paid for, OP is simply turning it into a GB\\n\\n### Reply 5:\\nSorry yeah i knew that I guess i meant, paid for him\\n\\n### Reply 6:\\nThanks!

Just send me a pm and let me know how and where to send you the first payment, if we can\\'t find any chip credits then I\\'ll owe you a little more money. I\\'m willing to buy 8, it still saves me some money, if that happens I\\'ll just give the extra 2 to you.\\n\\n### Reply 9:\\nIt looks like it is not only my problem but BFL problem again...Anthony is not longer with us, which is why the sample chips have languished. I just corrected this problem today and we have a new person on it... he should be getting the sample chips taken care of over the next couple days.<link>\\n\\n### Reply 10:\\nKISS (keep it simple stupid)If we had time I would do 16 chips but we have 100 days. It would be grate if the first board would work. So that why we are doing it simple. BFL board and adding power on it. If there will be a better board out there will be used but for now we are going this way. If you look at the long board(BFL single)and Jalapeno that BFL realised...You see that you have more or less the same components but more capacitors... On our board we have planed 8 but I think we need to change that to 10 or more seeing this... It looks like power usage spikes a lot...\\n\\n### Reply 11:\\nlucko why did not copy bfl labs board???\\n\\n### Reply 12:\\nSorry what? You probably misunderstand that. It will be close but not 100% same... Why. We need board done in 100 days with who know how long without sample chips. Not a lot time to experiment... KISSPictures are there just to show that we are probably going the right direction... This is not the boardEDIT: Sorry... misread what you wrote... Just coping a board will not do. From what I read even with 2 chips and firmware 1.2.5 and some \"overclocking\" some have overheating issues on 1V power supply... We also plan to add basic overclocking and overvolting in...EDIT2: This overheating is more or less on older models of board but still... New models(one that was released) should support 4 chips, even 6 if there is no issues with them spiking power usage...\\n\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\nReply with the hardware names, all in the same line, separated by commas.

P&P, tracked, insured, next-day signed-for, with tracking ID supplied privately on the day of shipping please.I will hold this offer open until Friday 5th July 22:00BST during which time I hope that some timings for this buy, or if it\\'s going ahead at all, might be known by then please.I would have to buy in a lot of the BTC to fund this, and I\\'m also a newb round these parts (but been GPU mining and following BTC as a hobby for 3 months).Because of this I would like to ask if you would accept a UK-UK bank transfer in GBP equivalent.This would be easier for me, no exchanges/fee\\'s or middle-men for either of us, and very secure for you it would be non-reversible just like BTC itself.This would be at a benchmark conversation rate, open to further discussion.If this is not acceptable no offence will be taken, I will buy up BTC accordingly and my offer still stands.As per your offer \"payment doesn\\'t need to be made before hand\" I would wish to make payment at a time you can publically state that you have the units in hand and ready to ship next-day following your receipt of confirmed payment. I look forward to hearing from you a<rest of post truncated>\\n\\n### Reply 2:\\nGreat, so about 16 units to go @johncabat, If this buy receives enough interest and goes ahead, I\\'ll make a payment from my own funds for the 50, I wont request payment until YXT confirms he has shipped, and I have a tracking number. This way I can quickly organise shipping for the day I receive them (Yes, escrow is fine for the nervous). If you\\'d prefer to wait until they are in my hands, this is fine but you\\'ll run a risk of a small delay or someone else buying them. With regards to accepting GBP, I can do this as well but I\\'d prefer Bitcoin, as it means I\\'ve then got to exchange it on <truncated> myself.\\n\\n### Reply 3:\\nHi OutCast, Thanks for the quick reply. Yes, fair point about the payment timing and not wanting to miss out. I agree that when you have evidence that YXT has shipped would be a good time to pay.Thank you. As you say that BTC is definitely your preference I will endeavour to pay in full with BTC. I\\'ll start buying some up this week, but not the full amount until we know this has the big full green light. It\\'s just a shame I\\'m not sat on a nice pot of BTC, the only thing making me nervous is the as yet unknown timings of things and me being sure I can sort the fiat<->BTC quick enough. So I could be safe in the knowledge that if I\\'m a coin or two short at the last minute, I would make sure you get 100% of what I owe one way or another. For your inconvenience and fee\\'s in having to handle GBP if necessary I offer a goodwill +7.5% on any GBP part above the agreed exchange rate.I\\'ll just cross my fingers and sit back now for the week, hope you get the additional interest to go ahead.I came here having already looked around at my options to get hold of some of these sticks to the UK. Everything else I saw had issues with either pricing, risk, availability or expensive international P&P. <rest of post truncated>\\n\\n### Reply 4:\\nHi,I am curious as whether you really see any ROI with these. At least within the first 6 months. Or are you planning for ROI in lifetime.The problem is that even if you achieve ROI, after that (in about 6 months time), then it will mine virtually nothing, given the ASIC juggernauts that will be on the market at that time.The big question, as always, is on delivery of the ASIC counter parts. Any delay on them is a gain for what\\'s available now.\\n\\n### Reply 5:\\nThe magic 8 ball says \"try again later\"...Sorry, jokes aside, I really have no idea, and although you do raise a very valid point, I\\'m personally looking to replace a room full of loud and hot graphics cards, for me they\\'re quite ideal even if they do take 6 months to a year to break even.*edit* Can we try to keep this on topic, please only post if you\\'re from the UK and are interested.

They have the production lines etc. paid for - they might as well keep making them as long as there are people willing to pay. They might have to reduce the price per unit a bit or something in the future, due to the lower return as the difficulty continues to ramp up or if we get new competition (hopefully!).IMO the only thing would be is if they decided to stop production for a while to build a second generation - like a different technology node for the ASICs or tweaks for speed or power improvements.

I have had no problems running 10 miners on this one style only. It has a 12V 4A Power Adapter plus Smart chip power management allows devices to communicate idle states and latency tolerance for progressively lower power states and subsequently increased performance and power efficiency. Most USB hubs are less than 4A . The trick here is that you get the 4A(which wouldn\\'t quite be enough to run 10 miners) AND 12V(instead of common 5V) which is plenty together for 10 miners.\\n\\n### Reply 11:\\nAll express shipping rates have now been lowered.\\n\\n### Reply 12:\\nwoobone 10, 9.85 (express mail) please confirm thanks\\n\\n### Reply 13:\\nemc2 ; 7 ; 6.66 ; <truncated>\\n\\n### Reply 14:\\nThis is confirmed.

Once mounted can\\'t be removed so any error can destroy the chip on board... So now I\\'m looking for the best possible company for placing the chips on boards so no problems will pop up... Company I was planing to use isn\\'t that sure they can do it without errors or with minimal numbers of them... But this problem is still 85 days away... It will be solved... They can do the boards and it looks like it will be about 30 board and 20 mounting(this is just estimate since I don\\'t have exact number of boards)... Components will add up additional 120 but this is again estimate since BOM for BFL board is not in documentation and we have not made it jet(I didn\\'t write it down but if I remember correctly 600+ components)... So we are in a 200$ zone. I know this is close to price of Jalapeo but this board has 50% more power.

If we don\\'t get enough orders just for boards before mid August our BTC will be returned.\\n\\n### Reply 3:\\nWe will have pricing soon.Terms Well basically same as most group buys we say we want 1000 boards for best price we collect the BTC and if we hit 1000 boards we pay for the fabrication up front and that locks everyone in as we have to convert to pay in Fiat.Return BTC if the buy fails to meet target boards by a specified date.Trying to gauge interest first but we are already committed to a larger production run we are doing as a cooperative thread here: <link> for K1s with chips, so we can actually slip in a large amount of boards as well sans chips at any point and even during production or to keep production going if we have to wait on chips from Avalon at any point.\\n\\n### Reply 4:\\nDYI I think... because if you don\\'t have chips why buy the boards? We are not doing a fab for people as this is just a board buy for those who might need boards. Need to ask our Cooperative members if we have anytime to collect others chips and ship them out finished but that be another thread.\\n\\n### Reply 5:\\nWhy would you take BTC as payment only to turn around and convert it to Fiat? All that\\'s going to do is tank the exchange price on BTC.... You guys make no sense... sheesh\\n\\n### Reply 6:\\nI\\'ll take 16 K1s complete with all chips except ASICs as soon as you can provide them.What is the price?\\n\\n### Reply 7:\\nPrices will be posted on the website when it is up this week.\\n\\n### Reply 8:\\nI\\'m interested for 8 boards without avalon chips.Pls post prices when you can.Thanks.\\n\\n### Reply 9:\\nWill do as soon. Tomorrow maybe.\\n\\n### Reply 10:\\nInterested.. Waiting for pricing.\\n\\n### Reply 11:\\nWe will have a large production run going and can slip in boards as a service to the community who may need it, make a little extra for the coop members without having to CONVERT these K1 orders possibly. Ok? Also how is 100 to 200 K1 boards value going to some how tank BTC prices. Wow... when did BPMC become APPLE? Hehehe.\\n\\n### Reply 12:\\nNeed to get a minimum say 100? Price will not include shipping.I will post prices Monday after I talk to our member heading up the fabrication on logisitics of this and what minimum we would need as well.\\n\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\nReply with the hardware names, all in the same line, separated by commas.

I didn\\'t say 500.. I tried to explain it can be anywhere betwee 120 and 500...

The first week we\\'ll mine around 8 btc per miner.. however that profit will keep droppign 20% a week then if diff keeps rising.. So you see, difficulty has huge impact on ROI. It\\'ll be most important to just get the miners up and running asap.. To that effect; we\\'re discussing if flying/driving over to pickup both day 1 and day 2 shipments might be better as shipping will most likely take a few days to.

There are PCB board manufactures here that can make the boards to Australian standards.There are two ways to do this. Take trust out of the equation and meet and swap details, perhaps put something down in writing (perhaps not to everyone\\'s liking but preferable and solid)The other is to get a trusted escrow happening. I\\'ve emailed JohnK and because I\\'m new it doesn\\'t make sense to give me the trust unless I put a security deposit down with him and ID. I\\'m willing to do this if we can\\'t get it happening with option 1, but I would want a percentage cut for time and stress!What say you? Any fellow Aussies out there? Should we get it rocking for the land of Oz?\\n\\n### Reply 1:\\nHi mate - Im in Perth id be willing to grab some chips but escrow would be a must\\n\\n### Reply 2:\\nOK. One for Escrow.

If you are further along than [Group Buy #2], then I\\'ll tag along with you instead.\\n\\n### Reply 8:\\nJollyGood! jolly bad, I\\'ve already spent most of my BTC on zefir\\'s Batch 5, 200 chips. So I won\\'t be pledging any BTC to this Group buy. Maybe in the future when DIY boards comes to fruition. Be glad to collaborate to get the chips working tho. Are you an EE? I\\'m not, but I work with a bunch of EEs and S/w dev. who said they would give me a hand. Unfortunately they are not into Bitcoins, yet. I\\'ll be following the Open Source DIY project closely. Was that your plan on development? Or do you have a development team?QGPS: BTW, I\\'m in Sydney.\\n\\n### Reply 9:\\nThe pledges are the ones you see here. I\\'m just sounding out the idea to see if there is enough interest. I agree though, time is of the essence.\\n\\n### Reply 10:\\nHi QuiveringGibbage. I looked at Zefir\\'s group buy as well. Customs and duty into Europe then Customs and duty into Australia. I liked though that Burinin was \"just down the road\" in Germany and might be able to make the boards. I\\'m not an EE, but I work for a large Consumer Electronic company here in AUS but all our stuff is manufactured in China. I would want the boards manufactured here due to time and quality control. Lets see what the interest here is on the chips. Most people seem to want escrow and I really wanted to meet people and make something more formalized...taking TRUST out of the equation and going for something a bit more solid. Saying that the future is Bitcoin and we have a window of opportunity. If we order a batch here we will get 8 advanced chips from avalon to start developing the boards in May. Lets see where we are with interest this time tommorrow.\\n\\n### Reply 11:\\nI\\'ll commit to 100 chips for now, will probably up my order once I have a more solid idea of the fiat costs in making these usable.\\n\\n### Reply 12:\\nHi ausbitbank. Unfortunately after 24 hours I\\'m going to declare that interest has been too small for me to continue gathering interest for a group buy. It may seem like 24 hours is too short a time but speed is of the essence here, and I\\'d rather that other bitcoiners find a place in other group buys, even if it\\'s international.It\\'ll be interesting to see what the hashrate difficulty is by August when the ASICS finally flood the market vs the price of bitcoin. Regardless of which the network looks like it\\'s strengthening against a 51% attack from all the interest I\\'ve read on these forums.Good luck guys and I wish you all the wealth and happiness as we enter the new age of a global economy and the true start to a class one civilisation!All the bestJollyGood!\\n\\n### Reply 13:\\nHi guys,Well, ... I have a Group Buy. My country isn\\'t that far from Australia. Maybe we can consolidate there.

I believe it would be best to have pools where you can publicly view hashrate and hashrate over time. The only one that has that that I know of is Eligius, but I suppose waldohoover might prefer to have them as part of Mining Team Reddit on BTCGuild. Alternatively, you could use any pool and then use a webinterface for viewing hashrate, supposing such a thing exists for the mining client KnCMiner\\'s machines will support (I know it does for cgminer, it ships with miner.php)\\n\\n### Reply 4:\\nAs a BFL Asic Miner, I like Eclipse MC - using bfgminer.I find with Eligius, it can take a while to get to the min and you can\\'t adjust it, and if we are doing weekly drafts, it may not be best.Another one I like is DeepBit.Ozcoin is nice but I found my returns were smaller than expected.But either way, most pools have an API where you can pull the data, so it would be fairly trivial to create a site to show stats.Also many have email alerts on events, so we could have a forwarding event or parser for that.Depending on how my time is when the hardware comes, I can possibly assist in this.\\n\\n### Reply 5:\\nI\\'d like to reserve 1 Share\\n\\n### Reply 6:\\nI definitely want a piece of a Jupiter, and I can pay on Wednesday, so I\\'m shopping around now...Is that comment about waiting to order when BTC/USD goes up a joke?

Refund anyone\\'s BTC who doesn\\'t want the new price, and promise to reimburse buyers if BTC hits $X by a certain date. If a buyer will trust you with a BTC, they can certainly trust you to refund the 0.1 should BTC jump higher. At least this way you have a confirmed deal for people to buy in to.

But, understand that the title to this thread was made back when BTC was over $100 so 3.9 BTC doesn\\'t cover three shares anymore. Adeel updated the cost per share info when BTC started taking a dump... basically the Jupiter unit is $7,000 and each share is 1/54th the cost of the unit which is roughly $130 USD. Now that BTC is just below $70, it\\'s closer to 1.9 BTC per share. I\\'ve already bought two units, and the payout will still cover itself in time, it will just take longer due to the drop in BTC value. But then again, that\\'s assuming the value stays this low (or lower), and no one can say where the price will be in 6 months or a year.

This is around 47BTC at present and this is for 256GHash/second. The units can be expanded with further 256GHash/second chip units, however these are currently priced at $4,999 each. Therefore if there is enough interest in the group buy to purchase more than 256ghash/second I would look to purchase further base units rather than the individual expansion chip units. There is no point spending an extra $1000 per quarter terrahash when it is not required. At a later date the chips are likely to come down in price and which time they could be purchased to increase mining capacity at that stage.At the moment I am looking at general interest and peoples thoughts on this.I am thinking that the investment price would be something like 1BTC gets you 5.4GHash/second. The units would be stored and maintained at my location with running and maintenance costs being paid for out of the mining rewards, 5% seems pretty standard for these sort of offerings. It may also be a consideration to set aside a further 10% for reinvestme<rest of post truncated>\\n\\n### Reply 1:\\nsounds good just the delivery time is a bit long. the diff may be too high. <link>\\n\\n### Reply 2:\\nI figure the delivery time if met is ok based on 256ghash, especially when compared to buying a 5ghash BFL last year and getting it delivered today. Plus by buying more than one unit and trying to sell it for 50% to 100% more when it arrived it should allow for the purchase of 2 or 3 expansion chips, taking the hashing power up to 0.75terra hash to 1 terrace hash, for an initial investment of $8200. Worst case scenario is that we end up with only 0.5terrahash for our investment. Knc are currently offering 200ghash for $4k amd 400ghash for $7k, although shipping dates are september to October and VMC is October to November. So the offer is comparable to Knc in $/ghashThis equates to $17.49 per ghash for the 400Ghash machine whereas VMC works out as $15.23 per ghash. Basically I would happily start off any group buy with the first 50% of shares (approx 25 BTC)\\n\\n### Reply 3:\\nI\\'m not aware of a single mining company which has delivered on time so best not rely on prompt delivery I think. If we thought BFL screwed customers over, if one of these next-gen companies fails to deliver it will be just as disastrous as that, if not more so. Even just the Avalon chip orders are going to raise the difficulty enough :/ I think only spend what you can 100% afford to lose\\n\\n### Reply 4:\\n\" I think only spend what you can 100% afford to lose\" Yeah that was my thinking. I purchased one unit from profits made reselling USB miners and figured a good way to minimise any further risk is a group buy that would allow many people to only risk a small amount of overall BTC. The one thing I would note though is that even if Avalon get all their chips out the door, there is no reason the buyers will be any more successful than Avalon in getting them hashing in a short time frame. Still I do agree about difficulty increasing hence looking at an expandable miner from VMC at some point in the future as opposed to buying $4000 worth of BFL or Avalon products today.\\n\\n### Reply 5:\\nIf that\\'s the case then sure, why not take a stab at one of these next companies then. Any reason you chose to back VMC/AMC over others btw?\\n\\n### Reply 6:\\nI\\'d be interested. What sort of timeframe are you looking at purchasing?\\n\\n### Reply 7:\\nYour reasoning is sound. I would tend to agree. Ive down some mining, only got into it in april, but tasted cpu gpu and block etuptor asics. I know its transitional period now a big wave is heaving up and everyone wants to catch a part of it. Im sitting on sround potential 20k gbp to invest in something from this arena and not looking for a get rich quick thing thats why this expansion idea sounds goog keeping ahead on the wave and re investing in additional so the diff doesnt outstrip your setup is good. I know weve missed out on the avalon chip thing now unless some people sell big quatities from the earlier batches I would buy , they are very profitabe once you scale up to a couple of 100 gigs. But yes im still interested in this vmc and still lookin at knc also. Some timframes and margins would good.Thanks\\n\\n### Reply 8:\\nCost per giga hash is best at present, expansion options are also good. Kraterminer wants twice as much for a 60-90ghash machine (90btc)Knc early orders have been filled and have a higher cost per gnash with no expansion options. Avalon are only selling chipsBFL are BFLI am not familiar with bit fury offers\\n\\n### Reply 9:\\nI will look to formalise the offer tonight and include time frames.

Since we closed the pre-order, now you do not have to pay, but please be prepared to pay immediately after the testing chips (within 14 days of notification will be sent to you)\".Thus, we have the time (14 days or more) to raise money for an additional 8 devices. The price of the device is 2160$, but in BTC it can change every hours. Last price for pre-order was 21 BTC (0,875 btc/share) for hosting and 27 BTC for shipping. I suggest using bitpop as escrow with 0 % fee or you can send btc directly to me. When metabank will sent to me notification about preorder additional units, bitpot or i will send BTC to Metabank. If after 14 days the price will decrease i (bipot) will return extra pay to you, or if the price increase you will extra pay to me (bitpot).So.

(Is there a cutoff date?)If the buy fills up by August 1 for example, what is the current estimated delivery date of the chips?\\n\\n### Reply 1:\\nHey LajzThanks for the question. The quoted lead time from Avalon is 9 to 10 weeks from date of purchase. This means that is the group buy is filled by August 1st, then we would be looking at receiving the chips around the end of september, beginning of october.In terms of a cutoff date at which point the buy will be cancelled and funds refunded, there currently isn\\'t one. It really depends on what level of interest we get in the project. We are looking into finding some larger investors who will hopefully account for decent numbers of the chip order and assist in getting the order in quickly.If we find ourselves with little interest a month down the track then we will start reassessing. There will perhaps be other avenues of getting our hands on chips at a higher price if we end up not being able to fill the full order from Avalon. If we arrive at this point, i will make this option available to everyone who has put in funds for the purchase should they want to still get miners made.At this point however, we are confident that the word will spread and we will be able to fill the order.Barntech\\n\\n### Reply 2:\\nSounds good, I\\'ll take the chance on you guys.Sent payment for 16 chips and will be going with an assembled board.

Heck, even if I get only the chips to throw at someone else (or experiment with myself) job done...But lets see, Barntech, Care to use Escrow? if you get John .k into this Id be happy to throw everything at you now\\n\\n### Reply 10:\\nHey guys.So yes, it is a bit of a catch 22 scenario. In my experiences with these group buy situations, more people feel more comfortable jumping on board once that number starts to lower, but in order for that number to lower, people need to jump on board. The main issue is that you end up having to have your BTC tied up waiting for everyone else to throw theirs in, so it os understandably a bit nerve-wracking being of of the first. It is also largely about trust. Now, if we all just threw our money in, then we\\'d be there in no time. But of course you guys don\\'t know me, and so again it is perfectly understandable that you don\\'t trust me. But hopefully we can do something about that.At this point, the plan is to not use John K for escrow, and rather be our own escrow (though i am open to the idea of a third party escrow if that will help the project move forwards quicker). Our aim is to establish an ongoing business servicing miners to the community, and for this reason we would like to establish a relationship of trust with all involved. We are not here to scam anyone. If we ran away with your BTC, we would have no hope of seeing this project through.

After doing my first group buy (the hardware is arriving Wednesday), I have learned many things. I lacked the foresight to include the internet bill and commercial rent into the terms and only charged a flat 3% fee. Because Avalon delayed almost 3 months, I will now most likely be operating my first group buy at a net loss .In my opinion, a lot of these newer group buy administrators are going to run into the same thing. If the manufacturer delays months, or if difficulty sky rockets, they will not be able to operate profitably on a 3%-5% all expenses included fee (some will even likely operate at a net loss, like I am with my first group buy).So, to make a group buy worth my time, I have structured this group buy so that I am covered if the manufacturer delays, difficulty skyrockets, etc...

The costs simply have to be higher, because the Bitfury machines are more expensive. I didn\\'t mean to poke holes in the slightest.

No more chance to find block after 1 year of mining as when starting - being actually much less because of weekly difficulty increases. Not as likely as you might be thinking - could easily mine for 25 years and not be finding block. Finding block solo at that rate about 3.5 sigma event. Difference between 3.5 and 4 sigma events is being very small difference in probability-wise but large time-wise - from once every six years to possibly twice in a lifetime and not difficult to stretch out to sigma 4.5 making once every 4 centuries. Can only say results not being average after 1.4 million years of testing - should find block within 6 sigma - if not, average calculation probably wrong.In meantime straight PPS should paying in your pocket about 18 BTC over same period you mentioning.\\n\\n### Reply 19:\\nMy brother is saying that you are emailing asking for more in shipping charges than the cost of the goods?

More or less, the PCI-E to USB hub turns your former GPU slot into a USB hub for K1/ASICMiner Block Erupters.There are a few makes and models that I can purchase from the factory, but are generally similar, between a few styles. I\\'d like to see if there\\'s interest in this from Bitcointalk members. Given the price drops on the USBs, I imagine a lot of people want/need hubs and handlers for them. I\\'m (also) working on a large order of the \"Juiced\" 10-port hubs. The dirty secret is that there are generally two or three manufacturers of these type of 10-port, USB 3.0 hubs that are powerful enough to handle 10 USBs. They aren\\'t cheap, but everyone is seemingly sold out, which means a direct buy from the factory may yield cheaper prices, if not a guarantee that they\\'re at least available.So here\\'s what I\\'m looking at:These are also available in a vertical configuration, but cost about $2 more at wholesale. Group buy price on these would be about $12.50 USD + shipping if I can get enough orders (MOQ is 200, but I can absorb probably half of that myself)F<rest of post truncated>\\n\\n### Reply 1:\\nI\\'d likely be in for 2-3 of the 10 port hubs depending on ETA.\\n\\n### Reply 2:\\nWhat\\'s the power specs on the usb hub?\\n\\n### Reply 3:\\nI\\'ve had mixed results with Juiced... They\\'re definitely good for 9 ports filled with erupters. The 10th is finicky... I\\'m actually going to have one I bought for testing exchanged to see if its the hub itself..\\n\\n### Reply 4:\\nI bought 5 of the Orico/Juiced on Monday and just went back to by more. Someone must have bought the rest from the same place as they are sold out. Probably will use an artic fan in the 10th spot if its flaky.\\n\\n### Reply 5:\\nYou cant run 9 erupters + fan, it will crap out\\n\\n### Reply 6:\\nThe 4 port PCI card does not look like the spacing between the ports is enough to fit the USB erupter. RE the 10 port thing, a better deal is the DUB7 which reliably runs six erupter plus a fan, total of seven. (and it is much cheaper like $27 each) The 10 port unit could work nicely with the right power supply but you know they don\\'t have it.\\n\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\nReply with the hardware names, all in the same line, separated by commas.

I was inspired by your success obviously, Mog. If I don\\'t get any takers, I guess I\\'ll have to take delivery of my miner and hope the BTC revenue makes up the initial expense and who knows? Maybe a lot more :-)\\n\\n### Reply 5:\\nNo bids here? I am tempted!\\n\\n### Reply 6:\\nNot yet, stex...I would like to start the countdown to the auction close when I get the first bid. Does 2 weeks sound right?The longer time passes, the more it adds value to know that the order is already in the delivery queue!\\n\\n### Reply 7:\\nYou mentioned:OFFERING DETAILS- There are no fees on top of this because I will take the operational expenses out of the shares I keep for myself.I am confused on the number of shares you are keeping. You are selling 25 shares at 4ghs each, right? or, is it less?\\n\\n### Reply 8:\\nI\\'m tempted!!\\n\\n### Reply 9:\\nNot sure. I am mainly watching here. I am in the US too, and can invest a couple BTC here and there where I see value.\\n\\n### Reply 10:\\nTell us how many of those 25 belong to you\\n\\n### Reply 11:\\nHey damiano... The shares are each 4% of the miner (1/25, ~4Gh/s) no matter how many I keep. All 25 belong to me as of right now because the miner is paid and my address is on the order. But if you want to own a piece, just make me a reasonable offer My ideal outcome would be to keep 5 and sell 20 for around 80-100 USD (1.0-1.5 BTC) each. BTC bids I will have to accept depending on the USD exchange rate since I paid for the miner in USD. But I might not get interest for 20, I might only get bids for 10. Or if the bidding goes way up for all 25 shares (wishful thinking maybe ) I will sell all 25 and use the proceeds to upgrade the miner.\\n\\n### Reply 12:\\nSorry I missed this question. Hopefully the comment I left above answers it. The reason I can\\'t say exactly how many I will keep is because I don\\'t know exactly how many bids I will get. If I only get a few bids I\\'ll accept them and then I\\'ll just have to keep all of the rest since no one is buying them. Make sense?\\n\\n### Reply 13:\\nI can accept bids and PayPal payments in USD and convert to BTC if that\\'s convenient.If there\\'s any dispute or reversal I will refund the money and cancel the shares and the payouts. There will be a deadline on receiving payment so that the payment couldn\\'t be reversed after the BTC payouts were sent.\\n\\n### Reply 14:\\nI bid 1 share at $80 USD via paypal.\\n\\n### Reply 15:\\nThank you, aoshea, could you please send a PM and sign with your receiving BTC address?I will start the countdown!If you change your mind about staying anonymous / hiding your bid price, you can edit your post\\n\\n### Reply 16:\\nPM\\'d with the signed address. Also, will you be hosting any other equipment on site with the Mercury?\\n\\n### Reply 17:\\nbuy 1 share @ 1btc\\n\\n### Reply 18:\\nThanks, Elite Would you mind sending a PM signed with the BTC address you will use?Also feel free to edit your post if you change your mind and you want your bid price to be hidden.\\n\\n### Reply 19:\\nI am also building a small collection of LTC miners, but as far as BTC equipment I have no plans to add more.\\n\\n### Reply 20:\\nAuction is closing early next week, with or without bids.If I don\\'t get at least a few more bids I\\'m going to have to cancel the sale and keep all of the shares Compared with the other group buys people are participating in left and right (myself included) I thought this sounded like a pretty good deal, but I guess if there\\'s no interest what can I do?Thanks everyone for looking one way or another!\\n\\n### Reply 21:\\nNo one wants in? Too bad it looks my bid will be cancelled.\\n\\n### Reply 22:\\nHello, i will be interested in 1 share @ 1btc, but i dont have it all right now , im mining and will have it by the end of next week\\n\\n### Reply 23:\\nMay I know what the min shares to achieve that you are targetting?

I want to hear the opinions of my customers, and two of you have already written me message about it. You can PM me.I will send out email to you today to discuss the situation. I will try my best to help everyone to have the option as if you ordered the Batch #3 yourselves.\\n\\n### Reply 1:\\nI do not mean disrespect to Yifu, but I believe he should give us 2-3 Avalons, or partial refund credit for each batch #3 order or some sort of decent compensation. The difficulty is not at 10 million anymore and that is what the price was based on. So essentially I paid $6400 for a 3 module Avalon at the time. Now ROI looks like 45-90+ days. Right now, 6/24/2013, difficulty is at 19 million and will probably be 30-70 million before batch #3 ships.I also paid $2800 for 1 module in your plan.My trade-in, I paid $200 to ship and have them signed over 2 months ago as well. I chose not to buy a batch #2 because of this. In hindsight, I should have bought 2-10 batch #s Avalons.But what can I do? Give up? That\\'s not gonna happen. No matter how bitter the pill, I will hold my ground and have faith that you and Yifu come through. I used my money I saved to buy a house for investing in Avalon...I still have faith it will all work out.As a side-thought...I think we should invest in Avalon chips and assemble them on PCB.Very <truncated>\\n\\n### Reply 2:\\nSince refund option was offered only a week ago, we might as well wait for refund until NY (2014? 2015?), lol. Avalon treats priority trade-in customers like shit, what can we expect as refugees of batch 3?IMO, we still can get some btc off batch 3, but only if chips are not shipped before units. But i think they will and we will be fucked up.I\\'m very happy though that i haven\\'t ordered 3 module unit for <truncated> if you order chips now, you\\'d end up in the end of queue of 500 000 chips.

Please check the info in the email carefully, especially about the number of modules and the bitcoin address.I recommend a refund. For those who persist own the Batch #3 unit, I think we can find a solution.\\n\\n### Reply 12:\\nMany thanks.\\n\\n### Reply 13:\\nNot sure if you want discussion here or by email, I think here would be better save multiple people asking the same questions of you, so I hope you don\\'t mind if I quote.This is going to be crucial to the decision, and I don\\'t see you getting an answer from Avalon in time to make an informed decisionEG ball park figures$75 at time of ordering, $95 now means on a 4 module unit we could lose 23BTC, obviously that is no good, and we would be better to take delivery as that gives a buffer to get the $ value back. Plus with the new cgminer build they are running a lot faster than originally thought which helps a lot too.I\\'m inclined to keep my order if possible.\\n\\n### Reply 14:\\nI think it is much simplerOP paid avalon with RMB, so Avalon team will of course refund him with RMB since he paid with RMB. But OP still have our bitcoins, so he should have no problem returning the bitcoins that we sent him. Unless he already sold some coins for RMB, which for this kind of order is highly unlikely, and OP is a true bitcoin supporter, he won\\'t sell any large amount of coins I believe\\n\\n### Reply 15:\\nI also did not receive an email.

Sorry followed multiple threads trying to figure this out!\\n\\n### Reply 17:\\nI also did not receive the email.\\n\\n### Reply 18:\\nWaiting for the refund...\\n\\n### Reply 19:\\nA new email is sent.

I think I am OK because I now show as a \"Jr. Member\". Please note that I have been reading this forum for almost one month since I started educating myself on Bitcoin/mining but just registered.Back to this buy/my problems to make the cutoff:I have fiat but I am uncertain as to how best to turn that into BTC and get that to you in time to buy 14 BEES.I think I may be able to get part of the payment to you within 24 hours with the balance within 2 more days.I have followed this thread and have complete trust in you. I will work with you however you require to get this done. For example, I would gladly get in the queue and have you hold the miners until you have my full balance owed in hand which I will do ASAP with some guidance from you. This will be my very first BTC transaction and I do not want to make any mistakes-have any fiat or BTC go astray. Not the least concerned about you just concerned that I will make some error in a step or more, in for <rest of post truncated>\\n\\n### Reply 13:\\nThanks very much for that info Swimmer63. I am afraid, this time, I will have to pay a premium to get this done in the fastest way possible that is still secure/reliable. I expect after I get my feet wet/established I can avoid that premium and likely by following your suggestion. Thanks again.\\n\\n### Reply 14:\\nThanks for the quick reply Canary. I am checking into that and some other options.Would you consider taking something like a Western Union in an amount sufficient to hold the Bees until I get the balance to you in BTC? Obviously no ship until paid in full and if I do not get the balance to you in whatever deadline you set then you could sell the 14 to some else and hold whatever funds I have gotten to you as advance payment for the next batch.

They ship from China to me and then I send them within 24 hours from the USA to wherever you ordered from. I hope in a week I will have stock in hand to fulfill orders immediately. As I replied in a PM recently \"I am very efficient at shipping these once they come in. All orders will be shipped within 24 hours of me receiving them even if I have to call in sick to work and stay up 24 hours lol \" Thank you for the question.\\n\\n### Reply 7:\\nI have your address. PM me it again anyways with your order information once payment is sent. I asume its ok to have your order public since you posted it here? Thanks again for your order.\\n\\n### Reply 8:\\nAlso how less you can go 0.35?\\n\\n### Reply 9:\\nI will buy some from you at that price.

Now I can surprise my Mom and give her a miner for her B-day next month.\\n\\n### Reply 16:\\nHow long does it take you to receive the shipment from China? Are you using EMS to get them quickly? I may be interested in about a week; currently waiting for two that I had ordered prior.\\n\\n### Reply 17:\\nYou are not waiting on two prior from me. Maybe someone else? DHL Express is how I receive them. If friedcat ships Sunday night, I should have them shipped Friday/Saturday. If he ships later, I will receive next week and ship all orders out within 24 hours of my receipt. I will be very busy boxing, taping, and stuffing packages in advance so I am ready to go when they arrive. I also should have two helpers available to speed the process along. I would be pleased to take an order for you. Thanks for the question.\\n\\n### Reply 18:\\nAlso, in a week, I should have them in stock for immediate shipment once my first order arrives (thus my listing of 700+miners Paid for by my name )\\n\\n### Reply 19:\\nWhat is setting these prices? I\\'m confused, can you pm me how many I can get with like 30 btc?\\n\\n### Reply 20:\\nfriedcat/AsicMiner sets the price they sell to resellers. I and others then decide what we will sell them for at this time. The best way to do an order larger than 20 is to PM me directly. I will PM you for an order of 30 btc. Thank you for your question.\\n\\n### Reply 21:\\nOrdered, paid and PM Send\\n\\n### Reply 22:\\nThank you for your order!\\n\\n### Reply 23:\\nAn Order Is Being Placed With AsicMiner In The Next Hour That Should Arrive On Friday And Ship By Saturday!!!

I paid for a usps priority mail medium flat rate box. So far I ordered 30 sticks. I know a medium flat rate box can fit 60 sticks with room to spare 2 layers of 3 boxes.

You should have been contacted by me and allowed to purchase 30% of past 0.89 btc+ orders from me at the 0.10 btc price. I was told to handle the 30% promo with my customers as I see fit. Thus, ALL(not the last 30%) past 0.89+ btc orders qualify for the 30% promo, not just the last 30% of orders(which would have been unfair to everyone as the last large order I placed was for my own personal use). If friedcat allows 100 % promo on all orders at 0.89 btc and above, I will pass the savings on to my customers. Everyone that is entitled to promo units will be able to purchase them.

Of course, this doesn\\'t take into account that you could run a KnC miner for 1-2 months to recover most or all of your investment, and then resell it at a premium (hopefully) to lock in additional future ROI much earlier than 1 year, when all of these pre-order devices will be just about useless if TBG is any indicator. KnC hasn\\'t indicated whether they\\'re shipping in early Oct. or late Oct. but if HF can meet this deadline, in the same time frame, you might be offering the best pre-order proposition anywhere & the 3% host fee is very reasonable too. Since they\\'re domestic, buyers would likely see quicker delivery times.Question to \\\\\\\\u\\\\DidHeJust: Will this miner & future additional miners fall later in the queue or will HF allow you to just increase your order due to your first 2 purchases?

I will delete this topic in a day or two.The HashFast Baby Jet is offered for sale in limited quantity, delivered in order of payment.they ask for $5,600 payable in bitcoin. Prepaid. Delivery estimated for October 20-30. Estimated hash-rate 400 GH/s. Estimated energy efficiency 1.0 J/GH.Previously, I sold income shares in a Batch #2 Avalon. This Avalon is hashing, and the mining income and disbursements are visible on the blockchain. Delivery on this Avalon was anticipated in late March and actual delivery occurred in mid July. The actual hash rate for the Avalon is 80/65 of the advertised rate, and the earnings are less than 1/4 of the rate at the time when many people paid.I have not placed a Baby Jet order. This auction is an attempt to raise about 60 BTC in order to do so. I will only sell about 1/2 of the future income for that amount. Many people in the community have experienced regret in placing pre-paid orders.Due to delays and ecosystem changes, purchasers of other bitcoin offerings are worried that they cannot break even on their purchases.

I just sent him my sample chips for testing. I think the more BFL clone options we have the better...<link>\\n\\n### Reply 1:\\nYes but I think it will not work with more then 4... They are using BFL Jalapeno board with no changes from what I can see. Not that we are taking much different route... But we did modify power supply to handle 50% more... And the price is a good deal for them If BFL send this board with housing, 2 chips and power supply for 273$... And you can get it 25% off...\\n\\n### Reply 2:\\nI trust lucko\\n\\n### Reply 3:\\nMy understanding is the $240 includes just the board cost and chip installation. Cooling installation cost is about $30. Chip cost and psu not included. Also his board has not been tested yet.\\n\\n### Reply 4:\\nYesterday I got a conformation that I\\'m in line for them... The problem is that it should be shipped already. But we are not at point where this is a real problem since we are still finalize the BOM for the board(BFL didn\\'t give the full list). And there is a small problem with automatic pick and place that is just not accurate enough for mounting this ASIC chips. So we are currently looking for a different solution... It will probably had to be done with manual pick and place unit... I have no idea why this is more accurate but I believe the experts know what they are talking about...In case we need them I will send you a msg... For now I\\'m in line for 6 of them but to see full board working 2 more would help. And some might end up \"destroy\"... They can\\'t be removed from the board once mounted...EDIT: If you know about someone who did BOM for BFL plate can you send me his way...\\n\\n### Reply 5:\\nThis is interesting: <link>\\n\\n### Reply 6:\\nAt those watts I\\'d rather use dedicated psu than get a 2000 watt psu.\\n\\n### Reply 7:\\nHi Lucko,Thank you for your comment.We use BFL\\'s Single board which it can mount up to 8 chips. The microcontroller connects all the ASIC in parallel. Also, Voltage specification for every chip is same and current requirement is 100mA max. Means, in the peak load, the chips will draw 800 (8X100 mA), thus no reason to increase power supply. I am sure that know that increasing the power supply,sometimes, has a risk to fry the chips.Boards cost $240 each including mounting of the chips, but without cooling system. I believe that it is one of the most competitive prices in the market, considering how sophisticated and expensive is the manufacturing of the boards plus the assembly cost of the ASICs which needs specific requirements and it is very risky for damaging these delicate chips to be done by hand.More info here: <link> we will upload a photo of our boards!Next week, boards will be ready and then they will need few more days for the assembly and the mounting of the sample chips.Cheers,Chris\\n\\n### Reply 8:\\nIf you are indeed just taking the board that BFL released and think you will just plop 8 chips on it, you\\'re gonna fail and upset alot of people who you\\'re trying to get to spend money with you.you need to do your research.\\n\\n### Reply 9:\\nThanks for the comment. I absolutely agree with you, that the board that BFL released nobody can manufacture it as it is, as many pieces of the puzzle are missing. We used BFL\\'s design with some modifications. We are a group of engineers working in that project during the last month and we have a lot of experience and facilities in the place we work to manage this project. The boards are already in the manufacturerand we are waiting for both sample chips and boards to test them together and upload a video of our results. Cheers,Chris\\n\\n### Reply 10:\\nLast time you told on BFL formu that you are using slightly modified(from picture looked the same) board BFL relised but that is not Single but Jalapeno... And as far as I know BFL failed to use it for anything else then Jalapeno. As far as I know they don\\'t use it in a Single. And Single is 16 chip board not 8... EDIT: You are lucky that you only have 2 chips It will work...\\n\\n### Reply 11:\\nThanks for your comment.You dont have to modify the PCB, which is in the picture. The PCB is the same for boards from 1-8 chips.The components are different and we modified them accordingly.Our board is designed to work with up to 8 chips. Singles have 16 chips as you very well said and mini singles have 8. Cooling will be challenging as they are many asics in close proximity, butwith the right cooling system can be managed <truncated>\\n\\n### Reply 12:\\nWell you stated that you are using Single board. Since I didn\\'t see mini single board this is a guess but I think Mini single is longboard with only 8 chipsSee: <link> looks to be same size as single board and it is different then Jalapeno that you posted in BFL forum...

I have sold about 40 sticks on ebay. Today I sold 27 sticks at 53 bucks a piece based on the new price of 29.50 usd a stick = .31 btc . my profit was just about 23 a stick. after fees about 19 a stick.I think that if the Canary becomes a drop shipper for me it would be a good deal.Upside is I have a prebuilt stellar name as a seller and the work is less with him drop shipping. I could sell a shitload of sticks at a low price . making 20 to 30 bucks on 3 sticks works for me since I have no workload vs making 57 bucks and doing all the work.Downside is I piss off a lot of other sellers with lowball prices. Not sure I want to do that. I need to sit back and think about the ebay idea carefully.\\n\\n### Reply 8:\\nThis isn\\'t anything new, Amazon can do the same for you guys....

I am going to weigh my options carefully over the next few days.\\n\\n### Reply 12:\\nHonestly, if Canary wants to sell on eBay he should sell on eBay and undercut the other resellers there like he does here (pure capitalism). The margins are slim enough on eBay and Amazon now for anyone selling and hoping to recoup profit before the next BE price drop. As-is, it seems like most folks on there about start selling their inventory when the next price drop rolls around, so it is only a matter of suckers buying them at the rate they are buying them before more sellers pop up with lower prices. Plus this muddies things - what if there needs to be a return, what if a unit is DOA, etc.? That\\'s a lot of shipping around to involve a third party in one of those transactions, mailing fees alone for such an error would likely eat up profits for people buying at current prices.\\n\\n### Reply 13:\\nCanary isn\\'t stupid. To kill the retail market would be equivalent to committing suicide. The usb miner sales will die soon enough. Yoou anger the people who buy large amounts they will remember when the erupter sales are EOL. As it stands now he has a healhy relationship with his bulk buyers. I don\\'t see him ruining that for a short term item suchs as the erupter.\\n\\n### Reply 14:\\nI know he isn\\'t stupid, he understands this business better than most. He\\'s just trying to wiggle into every last facet of sales. It\\'s already obvious he has a majority of sales on the forums, but this ^^^^ is only going to make eBay and Amazon a bigger mess of sellers than it is currently and there are those hanging issues of returns, DOA, etc., that make it even messier. Would have made a lot more sense to do this when they were 1.05/.99 each, USBs are only going to realistically sell for so much longer, let the folks already liquidating do so with the inventory they likely already purchased from Canary or SSB. In other words, this offer is basically going to undercut anyone who previously purchased and is reselling.

I think I saw somewhere some Finnish dudes came up with a mode where you can squeeze about 1.75Gh/W out of Bitfury, which could extend its life span quite a bit, especially for the stacked units. It gives a lot lower hashrate in that mode, of course.\\n\\n### Reply 2:\\nThe the watts per GH/s will become an issue eventually next year, but at the moment the ROI in terms of BTC per day from the upcoming difficulty hikes is what ASIC miners are watching. Underclocking should be possible, but even with a full overclock, the power consumption of the board is going to typically cost $3-$6 per month depending where you live.\\n\\n### Reply 3:\\nCRAP! Damn paypal making me miss out!\\n\\n### Reply 4:\\nYou still have chance on Monday.\\n\\n### Reply 5:\\nI can read some of you like milkbottlec want to push the chip at its upper limit. I will give priority to run the system on the long term, at least for 6 monthes (what mightycount called \"ROI conscious\"). Pushing it, is a very dangerous game, I wont play with fire. While running at the upper limit, that could drastically reduce the lifetime of the system, chips can break down. The hottest they run the shortest their lifetime. Since drillbit can be tuned at different frequencies, it\\'s up to everybody to set up the system as you like.About bitfury chips, I think the maximum efficiency is around 2Gh/s and the maximum it can handle is 2.7Gh/s (short time boost or with heavy heatsink).\\n\\n### Reply 6:\\nburnin has plans to try and push 5GHash/s out of his sample chips..

I don\\'t know why, you can buy individual sample chips at 1BTC each but what is the point of samples if you can\\'t then buy bulk?So, a batch #2 is looking shaky atm. which is sad, because I like the specs of this project the way it is. We\\'ll have to wait until Monday to see how many chips are left from batch #1.\\n\\n### Reply 12:\\nHope i haven\\'t missed first batch,Was a little too cautious at first, Lets see what Monday bringsIf there is any space left id like to order a fully build unit,Here\\'s hoping\\n\\n### Reply 13:\\nI always wait one day too long. Well, maybe there will be a chance Monday.\\n\\n### Reply 14:\\nBFL completely, completely fucked me, straight-up lied and robbed me. The Avalons I tried to buy got caught in customs, permanently, apparently. Round three, Bitfury. I might have bought from KNCMiner but the fact that they haven\\'t shown a prototype chip and they are supposed to ship in 1 week seems really fishy.\\n\\n### Reply 15:\\nAmen to that!\\n\\n### Reply 16:\\nJust about all the ASIC manufacturers you mentioned are killing their own markets, incredibly short term thinkers. WTF were BFL thinking last year when they announced the 1,500GH/s Minirig? They got millions of dollars of orders for the things, from people that don\\'t need to be mining at all if they can afford $30k a rig. Why are Avalon taking orders for millions of chips, does the net need that much?Same goes for KNCminer and the Bitfury 400GH/s units. Why release such powerful systems onto the network? By the time they ship they will be over priced and useless. What\\'s the follow up, go 28nm and sell too many GH/s again, then what? That\\'s as far as the tech goes, after that there are only price wars which will close most ASIC manufacturers, Moore\\'s law wont save them, the diff rate increases are way faster. Had these people stuck with a 20GH/s product like the Drillbit board we would all be better off, and they would have had a sustainable market. ROI comes not from the number of GH/s you have, but how much those GH/s cost you. The Drillbit boards at $300 for 20GH/s are better ROI than an Avalon Batch #3 which will never pay for itself, nor will any BFL product shipped af<rest of thread truncated>\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\nReply with the hardware names, all in the same line, separated by commas.

The batch ordered last Friday are due to be shipped from my supplier to me on Saturday. I expect to receive them mid-late next week and will turn around same day depending on what time they arrive. All of the buyers in this batch are in the Australia Post Next Business Day Network from me, so should receive very quickly. All of the buyers in the last batch did receive them the next day.2. I have been able to confirm a price drop to BTC0.4 per unit and have updated the first post with this information. Orders placed from now on will occur at the new price and as per previous batches, this includes all taxes and shipping fees.\\n\\n### Reply 1:\\nhow much is the discount for pick-up in adelaide?\\n\\n### Reply 2:\\nThe discount is BTC0.03 per unit for local pickup.\\n\\n### Reply 3:\\nFor people currently waiting for their order, there was a delay in my supplier receiving their stock which has had a flow-on effect to me. I was expecting these to ship to me last week but they haven\\'t yet, I\\'m still chasing this up.Reminder: approximately 2 more days until the current batch is cut off and an order placed. As an aside, if my supplier can\\'t guarantee delivery within a reasonable time frame, this will probably be the last batch I order as I feel I can\\'t provide a decent customer service if I can\\'t get stock myself!\\n\\n### Reply 4:\\nI have now received a tracking number for batch 1, so this is now enroute to me. Expecting to arrive Monday at this stage.\\n\\n### Reply 5:\\nSlightly over 21 hours until this order is placed.\\n\\n### Reply 6:\\ndazz,will the price go down again with the next shipment?\\n\\n### Reply 7:\\nI\\'m reviewing the options at the moment, the price for me to purchase has gone down slightly, but in a couple of cases previously I\\'ve underestimated shipping costs so I\\'ve ended up subsidising the costs myself. I\\'m not looking to make a lot of money on these, but do need to at least cover my costs.On a plus note, the order just finished is double the size of my previously largest order and includes a fair number for stock so I can do a quick turn-around instead of waiting for international shipping. If I continue to have enough interest I plan on keeping enough in stock to cover any orders.\\n\\n### Reply 8:\\nI have gone to the cryptominer website, opened an account and deposited 0.4 BTC, but get \"no orders have been placed yet\" on my order status.Has the order system been adjusted to reflect the price change? The home page still shows the price of an Asicminer USB at 0.55 BTC.Cheers,Phil.\\n\\n### Reply 9:\\nHi Phil, I can see your deposit in the backend system (and you\\'ve set your shipping address), so it\\'s definitely there. The website will show no orders until I move the funds from your deposit address to the main address and place an order with my supplier (or ship from stock). Until this is done the funds sit in your account on the website.Thanks for the note about the front page, I have now fixed this so it pulls the value from the database (it was hard coded on the homepage).\\n\\n### Reply 10:\\nAfter what seems like forever, tracking information finally shows that the first batch of Erupters should be delivered to me tomorrow. My wife will be confirming with me when they arrive and I will be leaving work early to get these in the post to you. Parcel satchels are already labelled ready to go.I have also been able to bump all orders from forum members in the second batch to the first batch using the extras I purchased for stock, so everyone should have them this week.\\n\\n### Reply 11:\\nAre you getting the new erupters? I\\'m looking for every colour.Also looking for every colour of the old erupters ( except black)\\n\\n### Reply 12:\\nI am not sure if the batch due to arrive now is the new or old colours, but I would expect the one after that will be the new ones. I won\\'t know if they are, or what colours they may be, until they arrive. I currently only have black or red ones in my own farm.\\n\\n### Reply 13:\\nOK, I have had this call, so they have definitely arrived and will be posted out today. I will email each buyer with their tracking number once I have dropped them off at the post office.\\n\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\nReply with the hardware names, all in the same line, separated by commas.

I don\\'t want to run a group buy by any means, but would anyone be interested in running a groupbuy of this mining package, where people could buy, say, a minimum of 500GH/s or so, and pay one outright fee, plus a monthly fee, or one outright fee that would cover 6 or 12 months?For one year, the total cost is around $9670/TH, including the monthly fees. To compare, at a rate of $0.16/kWh, 15TH/s buying their units and hosting them in a datacenter, assuming the only datacenter cost is electric (as $0.16 is a bit high for datacenter electricity), would cost around the same ($9750). Just a thought.\\n\\n### Reply 1:\\nI have .086/kwh where I am, and 8 mo/ year no ac would be needed to cool.

If i understand right they will double to 30TH/s for free (ok, there are monthly costs)DIFFICULTY RISE INSURANCEWe are aware that predicting the difficulty growth rate can be difficult due to the large number of undisclosed miners and new entrants. Thats why were dedicated to offering the best prices now and in the long term. Although the difficulty rate is up at a exponential growth rate we are quite confident that the difficulty rate will not pass 350 Million within 4/5 months as that would require an additional 3 PH or e.g. 50,000+ Gen1 Avalon units to be shipped before December.xCrowd will be the best hedge against near term difficulty increases due to our low prices. Were also offering a discount of 50% to double your hash rate if the difficulty rate rises beyond 200 million before we start shipping. If the difficulty rate passes 200 Million before we start bulk shipping, our customers will receive a 50% discount on any future blade or unit purchases.For example, if you purchase a low-entry eight blade Olympus unit you will be able to upgrade to another additional eight units for just a<rest of post truncated>\\n\\n### Reply 4:\\nThought you might be interested?<link>\\n\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\nReply with the hardware names, all in the same line, separated by commas.

I received guidelines, but none identical to what you stated.

Essentially, at this point, you\\'re only going to be eligible if you participated in one of my two group buys, which started on 6/25/2013. Orders prior to that are not eligible at this point. If you do not claim your discounted units within 7 days, you will forfeit them.If your order was prior to 6/25/2013, please feel free to still fill out the form and make payment and once friedcat delivers 100% of hardware at the discounted price, yours will immediately ship.I will not entertain pricing discussion other than to say I put a lot of consideration into determining a fair price. Most customers who PM\\'d me suggested comfort at a price equal-to-or-higher than 0.2 BTC if I would consider re-selling again, even publicly.\\n\\n### Reply 4:\\nPositive response has been received from friedcat.Discounted pricing has been extended from ASICM! - extending to you at 0.195 BTC eachI am strictly serving previous customers at this point. If you purchased any Block Erupter USB from me, you are now eligible to receive a discounted quantity of additional Block Erupter USB at only 0.195 each. The pricing is based on an average of the time and materials required from me on all previous orders, and also is less than the average amount customers reported they would be willing to pay if I resumed selling these discounted units. The maximum quantity you are eligible for is equal to the total amount you previously purchased from me.IMPORTANT: ASICM is only providing me with 30% of the discounted hardware at present, and it\\'s been advised by official re-sellers that the 30% is to be distributed on a 1:1 basis starting with most recent orders. Essentially, at this point, you\\'re only going to be eligible if you participated in one of my two group buys, which started on 6/25/2013. Orders prior to that are not eligible at this point. If your order was placed prior to 6/25/2013, please feel free to still fill out the form and make payment and <rest of post truncated>\\n\\n### Reply 5:\\nAwesome job Kramer!!

I bought and paid for qty of 10 on Jun 11th.\\n\\n### Reply 8:\\nThat\\'s the procedure, according to official resellers.\\n\\n### Reply 9:\\nSo if I was in one of the group buys starting 6/25 am I entitled to 30% or 100%? And the ones I bought off of Bitmit have to wait till a later date? Just making sure I have this down before I start sending payments\\n\\n### Reply 10:\\nSo your 30% fell on Jun 25th?\\n\\n### Reply 11:\\nI only brought 3, and currently am earlier than the cutoff date, so none for me but I appreciate Kosmokramer doing this even though he isn\\'t reselling anymore. It should help folks recover some of that ROI\\n\\n### Reply 12:\\nThat\\'s a good question; I should have clarified earlier. Customers should eventually be eligible to receive 100% of previously ordered quantity at the newly discounted price. However, currently, I can only ship quantities that were ordered on or after 6/25/2013 (my most recent 30% of sales).If you only have orders from before 6/25, please wait until I make an announcement that all customers are eligible. You can make a request now and pay, but you will not receive anything until 100% of hardware is made available to me.If you have orders before and after 6/25, please only request (and pay for) discounted hardware that you ordered on or after 6/25.If you only have ord<rest of thread truncated>\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\nReply with the hardware names, all in the same line, separated by commas.

It may help others decide to join in, if I state my intention to invest all the Bitcoins mined by my USB ASICs during this month into this group buy. I may even throw in some alt-coins, if the weather cools down enough to let me run the GPUs For all the usual reasons, I don\\'t know exactly how much the total will be, but I\\'ll be disappointed if there isn\\'t enough for 6 shares, or half an H-board.

How about I give 50 YAC (a recent altcoin for those who can\\'t keep up with them all) per paid share in the next component (an H-board) to the purchasers of those shares. This is a kind of cashback or YACback offer if you like. YAC would be paid once the component is ordered and paid for.

We\\'ve committed in the OP to \"choosing appropriate mining pools to minimise rejects, minimise pool fees (if appropriate) and maximise pool efficiency\".

I\\'d be happy to take a vote on some options nearer the time - I perfer a democratic approach.

He has teamed up with UltiBit Cointerra Group buys... this may be a direction the OP and others should consider... I plan to host anything I can for the community.I am also considering starting a group buy for my facilities location where truly open source prices will be the hosting % fee.

By October/November, difficulty will have climbed to over 100 Million. You will be lucky to get your money back.\\n\\n### Reply 10:\\nGuys, the first batch of units that Adeel put in orders for were 5 weeks ago or more, including the two that I purchased. I asked KnC about them and they\\'re in the group that will be shipping at the end of Sept. or early October which is nearly the best you can ask for because everything depends on KnC delivering as planned. I\\'m also in talks with Adeel and he has a medical issue right now which is why he isn\\'t able to be responding on here recently. This isn\\'t a bust, just be patient. The option remains the same. If you want a share of a KnC Jupiter unit, this is one of the few last organized group buys that can still give you that chance. Everybody keeps speculating about ROI, but no one knows what will happen regarding that. As everyone says including the core developers for bitcoin, don\\'t invest more than you are willing to lose. If you think this is a bust, it\\'s not. If you think this is a risky investment, that\\'s a decision you must make for yourself and stop whining about it. It is what it is.Whatever the case, if BTC is $300 six months from now, good luck turning back time to purchase a few shares...\\n\\n### Reply 11:\\nHey guys, I\\'m sorry for being away for so long! I was worried that all hell would have broken loose by now, but thank god everything is okay over here . To everyone who sent payment while I was away, can you please send your payment info, receiving address and transaction ID to me in a private message. Anyway, due to the fact that I am in Oklahoma, the hospital I had my surgery at is actually a Cardiac response hospital and they made me have to live without a cell phone due to people with pacemakers. I have some other news to report, this system will be the last system that we sell shares for in regards to this group buy. We have been selling a large amount of systems locally for a higher markup and have decided that after this system, we will no longer sell anymore on bitcointalk. For this reason, if you are interested in getting in now, please do. These systems will be run for 2 years or until they are no longer profitable and then we will hopefully sell the system and split up the money from the sale as per your share holdings. Also, if you purchase shares over the amount that is available for the last system, you will be refunded.

Once any details are released, I will post them in my current group buy. My promos have been handled. Once more are made available to me, the proper customers will get them.

There will be delays in remaining tracking numbers as shipping is my first priority and I have a real life job. Tracking numbers will all be sent by Thursday at the latest(most Wednesday or already sent). Thank you for your patience. Any orders being placed right now should ship in 7 days or less from me(possibly sooner). I will be confirming new orders in the coming days.

Obviously I would need you to send them to burnin or another equally reputable assembler by then.About the customs fee, what is the rate in Romania? My research show it as 19% on total including s&h. I assume once you have the chips with the customs paid in Romania, the chips can travel, customs fee free, anywhere in the EU. Avalon -> Romania (pay customs fee) -> eu assembler (no customs fee) -> eu customer (no customs fee).\\n\\n### Reply 13:\\nIndeed, the goods can travel freely in the EU after you have paid the customs tax. I\\'m not sure about the import tax, though. Every single item type has a different import tax. A hazardous material costs much more than electronics, for example. I also do really hope that the documents will not show the value of the goods, however, i doubt it. In that case, the tax will be calculated based on value. I\\'ll make some calls to a few co-workers and i\\'ll get back to you today in the evening, GMT+2 time.\\n\\n### Reply 14:\\nGroup Buy Sent to: t13hydra on: Today at 08:34:50 AM You have forwarded or responded to this message.

Practically we can throw almost any amount of devices at them and they can execute in a few weeks (2-3) tops, which brings me to a conclusion that they have a big capacity, specially for low or medium complexity boards. The greater news about this is that they can build custom devices housing 20, 60, 180, even 640 or 1280 chips.

I\\'m a bit of a hack and have deployed websites that are used by several hundred customers per day. What I have found out about the Bitcoin business in a few weeks is this...1. It is relatively impossible for newcomers to mine a meaningful amount of Bitcoin unless they have several thousands of dollars at their disposal or enter \"group buying\" arrangements. 2. Bitcoin hardware consumers appear to be tired of hardware vendors who take \"pre-orders\" and months if not years to deliver on their promises. 3. 330 MH/s USB \"Block Erupters\" are a waste of money. I setup a website to see if I could help myself and others mine a little Bitcoin without losing their shirts and minds in the process.

Still using the fabricated connector made from two smaller drive connectors cut down from 4 to 3. Still slinging the accepted shares back to the pool as it has all day. Love it.The provided connector takes stripped wires. One fashions the opposite gender of hard drive plugs from power splitters and drives the Blade from two drive plugs. One also needs to jump the ATX motherboard plug green wire to a black wire or use an ATX power supply checker to get the supply to wakeup. Not sure about quality server supplies from old servers as I tried one today, jumped what appeared to be the green wire to a ground and it didn\\'t work. Tried a supply checker and it seemed to show it was bad only showing +5VDC. I put the supply back in the server and mashed the off/on button and it woke up properly.

Good to see, and thanks everyone for putting yourselves forwards offering assistance. Feels like we could do something cool here. I definitely do like the 500-600 mark for smaller more accessible miners more than the larger offering from Cionterra. I totally agree that getting this stuff moving quickly is ideal, but at this point it seems we\\'re looking at January for either of these chips. As far as i can tell, none of them actually exist yet. I have a phone meeting set up with the guys from VMC on Monday so i will be able to get more details then and share them with you all. If i feel comfortable with their vibe, then it may well be worth moving quite quickly to secure early chips.

For those of you who have followed the Avalon chips disaster story you will know that burnin designed and assembled a very nice board (the bitburnerXX) for Avalon chips (<link> but that this project was hampered by the big delays in chip deliveries from bitsyncom.

I for one would love to be able to sell that. The real problem is not the sticks the problem is the hubs. shit hubs burn up and good hubs cost a lot. If 20 sticks cost the above price of 1.5 coins for 20 and 6 bucks to ship the miner needs 3x 7 stick hubs or 2x 10 stick hubs. So far the cheapest I have seen is about 3 bucks a port so if you can setup that would be 60 bucks plus the 190 for the 20 sticks total of 250 for 20 sticks and hubs. frankly I went with good hubs and it cost more. I paid 6 bucks a port for much better gear. So my cost for 20 mining sticks would be 310 usd. vs 250 usd. at 250 it comes to 12.50 per stick counting the hubs at<rest of thread truncated>\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\nReply with the hardware names, all in the same line, separated by commas.

So they would need a power source, fans, and some sort of physical support. Does jlsminingcorp have these available, or would part of our money be used for these parts? I\\'m assuming the useful life time of a PSU and fans is far longer than the mining boards, and don\\'t favour buying new equipment. I do have a spare PSU that could be used if it is required.I don\\'t see that the >40Gh/s speed is guaranteed, rather it seems to be a design goal. End-user overclocking also appears to be a design goal, so final speeds will probably be variable from board to board, and dependent on PSU and cooling efficiently, as well as the end-users views on safe chip temperatures, life time, and general gungho-ness. Does jlsminingcorp have any experience in overclocking similar hardware?Do I recall that the equipment will be in a domestic setting? I hope there is good ventilation since I imagine these boards will surpass GPUs in the heat produced.The timetable is unclear, as one might expect.

I can give a bit more info on some of those thoughts now, but others we may just have to wait and see how things develop with the project.Yes, what a shame that was for all concerned . To be honest, I think burnin was probably the most shafted by all of this - think of the time and effort and money that he must have put in to get that off the ground. Anyway, he\\'s moving on and so shall we!Yes, they would be standalone boards, but if the design is bitburnerXX inspired then they are easily stackable and can be connected together with CAN bus to make larger \"clusters\" (e.g. <link> <link> Some power sharing, as well as data sharing, is possible between bitburnerXX boards and I\\'d imagine will be here too. We have a power supply ready that will run the bitfurystrikesback miner. In principle it should be possible to run both sets of hardware from the same PSU, but I\\'m a bit wary of this, so another PSU would be better. We don\\'t have another suitable PSU free at the moment, so borrowing one or finding a suitable second hand PSU would probably be the best way to go (only ~ 40W needed per furyburner). I don\\'t believe any fans or su<rest of post truncated>\\n\\n### Reply 4:\\nOK, so could we call the furyburner board \\'component 7\\' and collect funds separately from components 6 & 8 (or whatever)? I\\'m still of the opinion that we should have funds ready to go when the orders are opened - if the performance/price when orders open is not good enough then we just let the opportunity pass and get an H-board instead.I\\'d like to see how you propose to deal with the (most-optimistic) timetable if the furyburner board arrives in \\'early October\\' and starts hashing, then the bitfurystrikesback starter kit comes a couple of weeks later. I haven\\'t thought of a good scheme yet...\\n\\n### Reply 5:\\nyou could stick to the OP rule of payout only for delivered boards just for the H-boards while treating any Furyburners as a hedge for the whole group. In case the Furyburners arrive early the payout rule would change and payouts would be made to all share holders for the time being. Thus there would be an incentive for existing share holders to agree to this fury hedge. I for one would buy more shares to get this fury hedge going... not sure though how much this arrangement would discourage potential new share holders from buying into those slightly less attractive shares of the furyburners... just my 2 cents.\\n\\n### Reply 6:\\nI agree that this would be better as a separate group buy. I\\'m on the fence as to whether I will participate in this group buy, but I would participate in a burnin bitfury group buy\\n\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\nReply with the hardware names, all in the same line, separated by commas.

As I said before you have some real life experience that is an asset to our group.

So as much as I want them to upgrade.I will wait until sept 28-30th to commit.\\n\\n### Reply 6:\\ndentldir sorry for the confusion - I guess I need to expand on the pricing box a bit more.The anticipated final price (including BitFury chip AND assembly) is in the 0.3-0.6BTC range. It is made of two components: BitFury chip (0.2-0.3BTC anticipated for October delivery) plus assembly and all other components (which we anticipate to be in the 0.2-0.3BTC range depending on quantity).So the high-end estimated final price is 0.6BTC at the moment.\\n\\n### Reply 7:\\nWho is WE?\\n\\n### Reply 8:\\nThe NanoFury team\\n\\n### Reply 9:\\nExcellent.

And that is only if everything goes perfect. November, even with NO cost on power never returns their value. And by never, I mean before I die of old age.

If we exceed the initial target of 3000 devices that would put the final price also closer to 0.4-0.5BTC (as assembly and all other components will likely also get closer to 0.2-0.25BTC).The final cost of course will be dependent on the number of devices this GB attracts. But even at the low range of 500 that still leads to a bit lower final price (than our initial estimates) which will likely be in the 0.50 - 0.55 BTC range.We\\'ll keep you posted.\\n\\n### Reply 19:\\nI will still keep a 6btc commitment by sept 30th. I will turn in 6btc. hopefully I will get 15 sticks (.4btc each) for that rather then 11. (.55btc each)\\n\\n### Reply 20:\\nWill this design be opensource?

CryptX the distributors have stated that they will offer a 100 Euro rebate on the order if the board does not reach a hashrate of 64 GH/s.

As I mentioned to Stinky_Pete, we\\'re not too keen on splitting into two GBs. I do appreciate where you are coming from, but personally I think that we should be trying to get the best hardware (bitfury based at any rate) at the best prices for this group and if an alternative supplier comes along that may provide this then we should be highlighting this to the group and (if there\\'s agreement) potentially switching suppliers. If somebody started selling H-boards at 60% of the price of bitfurystrikesback then it would be pretty clear that the group should buy from the new supplier (as long as they seem reputable etc.) I don\\'t think that we would be discussing a new GB in this case. I don\\'t see burnin\\'s bitfury offer as being so different from this situation, although the exact form of the hardware is different to the H-boards. My concern is that if we split into two GBs then they will inevitably compete with each other and both will be weakened as a result. However, this is just my feeling and if the majority of the group want to continue with this GB as we are then this is what we w<rest of post truncated>\\n\\n### Reply 3:\\nThey\\'re on sale!!<link>\\n\\n### Reply 4:\\nI\\'ve changed my mind, I now think the Bitburner Fury boards fit into this group buy, and I think we should buy one (with heatsink) or more as quick as we can.\\n\\n### Reply 5:\\nI agree that it\\'s not as good as we expected. Have I seen a figure of 65 Gh/s actually achieved with one of these boards?I have been looking at the numbers. If we order in the next couple of days we should get delivery \"in the first week of October\". Our \"October starter kit\" should come at the end of that month with the additional H-boards coming in later. The difficulty is going up by 33% every 10 days which is equivalent to 235% in 30 days. So spending BTC10 now gets us 4 Gh/s very soon which will be producing bitcoins; one month later spending BTC5 gets a 4 Gh/s board which will only yield half as many bitcoins. (I\\'ve assumed that the 33% increase is from sales of many, many USB ASICs and a few big players bringing their machines into the network - if KnCminer bring their machines to market in September that\\'ll make the increases even higher). I suspect the retailers are using similar figures and are pricing their machines as high as they can so that the purchasers might just get a ROI, but may not make it. In late October and November other bitfury powered hardware will be arriving, the Drillbit boards from Australia, and two different makes of 2Gh/s USB sticks.So from a purel<rest of post truncated>\\n\\n### Reply 6:\\nThe cheeky sods were supposed to email us loyal customers when the site opened, and yet did an email arrive ?Anyway, thought that you would all be interested in some pricing on these boards - not quite what was initially announced !Burnin bitfury board + chips + heatsink + postage + VAT (> 40 GH/s) = 895.40 Euro = 9.95 BTC (at 90 Euro/BTC) = 4.02 GH/s/BTCH-boards (25GH/s): October delivery: 390 Euro + VAT = 483.6 Euro = 5.37 BTC (at 90 Euro/BTC) = 4.66 GH/s/BTCThis doesn\\'t look good in terms of GH/s/BTC if we assume that the burnin boards run at 40 GH/s. Since nobody has demonstrated chips running much faster than this it would be a bit of a gamble IMO to assume that they will run outside the 40-50 GH/s range (anything else would be a bonus - if anybody can do it then burnin can though). There could be an advantage with burnin boards in terms of delivery dates if burnin meets his early October delivery estimate.So after being quite keen on the idea of using burnin as a supplier (based on his early estimated prices) I\\'m now not convinced there\\'s necessarily a case to switch. It all hangs on delivery estimates now, which are fairly hard to predict.Anybody else have any thoughts? Stin<rest of post truncated>\\n\\n### Reply 7:\\nI\\'m on board with Stinky_Pete.

Majority of return will be gained in first 3 difficulty jumps even before Bitmine devices ship.Worse J/GH/s ratio of KNC Jupiter against Bitmine devices isn\\'t important with cheap electricity.Network hashrate jumped to 1270 TH/s (only ghash.io is 190 TH/s) and there will be huge jump with KNC September/October delivery in 1-2 weeks.

I intended to invest in Waldo\\'s GB but rather invested in a KnC Saturn. IF that ships in time I\\'ll make a lil bit and add some more to go with a CoinTerra GB. BTC is gonna rise? Yeah maybe it will, if you\\'re betting on that, you will make far more investing in buying BTC low and selling them high. That\\'s what I do with WDC. I pump and dump it. Look on cryptsy. Been dumping loads of cheap WDC to bring it down from .000032 to .000027, And then I bought a load of WDC to sell when it goes back up :p But WDC mining is nascent, BTC mining aintEDIT: Oh so it\\'s you! :p Sorry to be harsh, lots of scammers around\\n\\n### Reply 6:\\nI\\'ve called up Cointerra for the first device I had ordered with several other buyers with them and asked where I was on their list. I ordered really early, and I made it for the first batch (first two weeks), but if you order now it\\'ll likely be mid January. Now I know how hype works, and I know their orders will be slowing down some, but if you wait till December to make a purchase, you\\'re probably waiting till March to get the device.Cointerra also has a pretty solid guarantee so they don\\'t pull a butterfly on you.\\n\\n### Reply 7:\\nYou *really* called them? I read on the forum about their phone numbers not working or something like that. CoinTerra haven\\'t been really very public with details. I\\'m putting my trust in KnC for now. They\\'ve been quite communicative. I might invest in a GB next month, dependent on circumstances.\\n\\n### Reply 8:\\nYes I called them, twice actually. It was the same person, so I\\'m pretty sure that guy might be very busy considering how many millions are being invested in the device. Have you ever tried calling them? You might as well at least try if not before speculating that it\\'s impossible to reach them.I didn\\'t get through one or two times because they were probably busy (I called soon after the new $6K deal was offered).\\n\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\nReply with the hardware names, all in the same line, separated by commas.

I personally use every usb spot with a miner, and use a desk fan (overkill) but it makes it where i don\\'t take up a usb spot with fan on multiple hubs. Kinda of fun though to have a few rows of them. Anker quality is top notch, but recently with all the hubs I have been more into the price per port on hub as my main factor. Sadly the new Anker 9 went down a port and also changed one to charge so you get 8 true ports, and 1 fan at a cost per hub that is a little high.The new hubs i ordered are MCM (if you google there is a 15 percent off promo code i believe on official site) cant vouch for it yet personally but its price per port is extremely cheap if you need multiple. They seem a little slow at shipping though at MCM. SSB is so good he beat my hubs here lol . <link> has a really good comparison of hubs and how many people can get successfully running on each brand and a lot of testing.If you do decide to order some are lots of fun to actually do some mining.

I\\'m from Switzerland, so might be useful for the communication or other stuff with bitmine.ch ... !\\n\\n### Reply 1:\\nCould be a winner, watching.\\n\\n### Reply 2:\\nFeel free to PM me or post more questions.Basically we are working on some concepts for the miner based on what we know of the chips from this point obviously early days but there seems to be some headroom and longer term ROI for this chip. Potential for alternative cooling as well. We will be working out more details on the plan but feedback here is also welcome so we can work out a fair equity for those doing the hard lifting for design and fab. We are hoping to make a design that will also be able to upcycle so that parts can be reconstituted should there be a new revised chip.\\n\\n### Reply 3:\\nDefinitely something to follow. Looks like details are coming out this month on the chips pertaining to a data sheet if it hasn\\'t already?At those numbers (8.5$ per Ghash) and a quick swag at the term it looks like these would need to be ready to ship in around the next 60 days at $1700 per 200 Ghash to make it towards a ROI projection. Looking at getting them out in November at 200 Ghash or possibly December if they can hit 400 GHash (4.25$ per Ghash) should be a target.

Good luck, hoping for some W1/W16 for Christmas!\\n\\n### Reply 6:\\nPretty rough rough numbers so hard to really say yet.The point of this is cutting out the \"middlemen\" to certain degree and going at this from a more collective perspective, so in terms of costs it be a lot more reasonable to do a DIYer or even the novice miner using this methodology, than say purchasing a similar ready made \"off-the-shelf\" unit from someone else and given that the group buy members are the owners of the project there won\\'t be the same sort of lack of information for the members that can occur. I would hope also that we can look at this rig in some way to upcycle or reuse it for other purposes rather than just a dead miner. There needs to be some sort of way to give ASICs a secondary value if they become redundant as miners. Vanity Address Generating Engine? But yes we have to look very closely at the numbers what sort of target price do we need to make it viable?\\n\\n### Reply 7:\\nAssuming a dec-jan delivery, My cooling will provided by the 2 4 ft exhaust fans bringing in the 10f outside air .\\n\\n### Reply 8:\\nWow! That be great but I think we should value your contribution a bit more than that, so I am sure a collective of members such as this would be willing to work out something that at least covers your costs and a bit to maintain and upkeep the systems? I am thinking cooling is going to be an important part of these newer units where a \"turbo\" mode doubles the hash.\\n\\n### Reply 9:\\nWow.That is definitely nice in the winter... come summer? I am kinda keen on oil submersion have components priced out going and have space on the 3rd floor of my building for a test tank something that could hold 100 to 200 of these units and maintain constant temperature year round.

As long as it is expandable as mentioned similar to the hive reference that would allow scalability. I have not done enough research to even throw my hat in the ring as to \"What else\" ASICs can do to comment intelligently on that front.

There are inverse relationships that are interdependent on each other as you know:PriceTime to <truncated> a balancing act but a simple economics equation. If they can be created and shipped while the projections show a probable ROI they will sell plain and simple.

The seller expects to be compensated for all the behind the work scenes even if the darn thing failed 5 months later. It\\'s tons of work behind the scenes to keep these things humming and to even succeed in a single GB on this forum in the first place. If it was easy, we\\'d have many more members trying to launch GBs. With that in mind, one of the services I offer is coaching & mentoring to new GBCs like thomas_sI\\'ve waived my usual 0.1% Pre-paid Pre-Planning fee for in-depth planning for those ambitious enough to attempt their first GB here to get R3/R4 off the ground & to help out thomas_sBack to refunds: Mass Refunds are usually handled on a case by case basis WRT to the GB, from I\\'ve noticed. Since I\\'m an advocate for both Buyers *and* Sellers, and since I believe in karma, so rest assured: In this at-cost co-operative, there\\'s no 1.5% restock fee if the majority of the group (in each respective Round) vote for a mfg. refund.\\n\\n### Reply 3:\\nStall tactics on your behalf. PM to John S. at HashFast:\"HI John,I was hoping to call you tomorrow morning about 7:15AM HST. I think that\\'s about 10:15AM PST.I def. have 1 Sierra sold - we pre-sold 100 shares for the MPP Sierra in less than 12 hours. I have part of a Round 4 HashFast non-MPP Sierra GB reserved as well, so we\\'ll see how that goes and we hope to buy a 2nd one before the deadline.The reason I want to call is that: even though the sale ends tmrw night at midnight, about a quarter to a third of the funds are in transit via Coinbase for a major shareowner in Round 3. Tomorrow night before your deadline: I was hoping that our at-cost co-operative could pay 50% of the MPP Sierra, and 50% of a non-MPP Sierra to secure availability for both of them to the GB forum.I\\'m about 100% positive we can pay the balance for both of them by the end of the business week as I already have over 10% interest for a non-MPP Sierra even after that 12 hour sellout of the Sierra yesterday (which is really fast for the GB forum).

From the homework I asked Thomas to do, it came out to about $1K+ for us to have 1 to 1.5 hours of backup power which would\\'ve added almost 10% to the share price for a $11K GB.

I\\'m trying to calculate out the total pricing, but it would help to know how many BTC you consider $69 to be? Or do you accept USD as a payment method?* If HashFast is unable to deliver at all, does the 1.5% restocking fee for refunds apply?* I see that there are 26 people involved in the management of this - is this a formal company with another purpose as well? This question is really more geared towards what is the exposure if a few people decide they want to retire from this - who\\'s left?* Can we visit the equipment if we\\'re in the area? * What happens if the machine is damaged and considered outside warranty?* I see the projection is resale in 7 months. If BTC/USD exchange rates increase so that it is still profitable to hang onto the equipment, is the existing hosting arrangement prepared for a \"long haul\"?* Will there be any written agreement documenting the co-op?Thanks for answering my questions - just trying to accept any risk here! Sorry in advance if any are dumb questions.\\n\\n### Reply 10:\\n1) we will be using bitstamp on this GB to calculate conversion as that is what hashfast uses.2) we believe hashfast will be able to deliver however this question would need to be answered by DZ as he is dealing with the monetary side, (I thought he posted it tho)3) Each GB that is run here by DZ is like a democracy, everything is voted on and the decision is made based on majority ruling.4) This would be a question for the host (right now I think the only person that has requested the hosting / received any votes is bobsag3)5) From what I\\'ve read the warranty is 10 days from defects, if it can be fixed (we would have to vote on weather fixing it would be more cost effective, we would be able to sell it to someone who\\'d want to fix it most likely)6) See #3.7) Ever<rest of thread truncated>\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\nReply with the hardware names, all in the same line, separated by commas.

He is also looking to offer hosting so be patient and soon there will be more information.I am not planning a 3rd group buy because the second one took long time to fill. It was only thanks to the initiative of the other Group Buys organizers from EU and zefir that we managed to buy two batches between all.

Instead of taking the refund, this anonymous Round2 Hero donated it to an anonymous Round1 DZ Cooperative member who\\'s been having a hard time. Wow! That is *very* generous (esp. if you consider future potential BTC values) and was much appreciated by the Round1 recipient, esp. since he or she has had such a hard time recently.

I had intended this previously but hadn\\'t announced anything, but half of 1 of my 10 shares for our R1 HashFast miner is also intended for this gentleman or lady, in case you\\'re wondering why my payouts for 10 shares of R1 in November may be lower then expected.This R1 co-op member *could* be scamming the both of us, but from the previous PMs I\\'ve had with this person and our shared love of culture and history, I highly doubt that this is the case.

Note that I did NOT download the zip file so I have no idea if Sophos will flag it or it\\'s contents at this time.I have used Sophos for several years and while it may be more aggressive than some other products it does a good job at keeping junk off my system.I may have overreacted when I got the pop up but since ssinc had already download and installed bfgminerWin and he made no mention of getting a waring I was surprised when I did.T\\n\\n### Reply 27:\\ntested with block eruptors and works.now i just wait for my new blue fury\\'s\\n\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\nReply with the hardware names, all in the same line, separated by commas.

I get to pick the color once you start taking payments, right?Let me know if you might be interested in doing an R6 group buy for one of my Day-1 KNC Jupiters - I\\'ve got a number of them that will be headed down to MO for hosting when they are shipped. These will be going out the door From KNCMiner in the next few days and should be hashing late next week or very early the week after.These don\\'t have an MPP, but they are minimum of 400 Gh/s and supposedly much more - possibly 500 Gh/s from the sounds of things - and will be here well before the HF boxes. And, of course, I\\'d turn them over to the co-op at cost...\\n\\n### Reply 3:\\nYou really want to have the complete set lolUpdated reservation code.\\n\\n### Reply 4:\\nWell, if one of these HF group buys is worth having, they should all be, right? And why not collect a few shares in each color? This one is for the very first HF being shipped out the door. Historic, and these will probably end up being gold colored shares.\\n\\n### Reply 5:\\nDamn, now I don\\'t know whether I want to wait for a Day 1 Jupiter to potentially come in, or pony up for the HashFast. What a good problem to have!\\n\\n### Reply 6:\\nThe R5 is real, there might not be an R6. Who can resist being a part owner of Hashfast order #1 ??\\n\\n### Reply 7:\\nAs for the upgrade so no one is pressured to purchase it immediately, when we have the unit purchased I will front the BTC required to get the upgrade anyone who wishes to upgrade their hash power for the @ cost price may do so prior to the ship date of the main unit.\\n\\n### Reply 8:\\nAre you meaning an R5 upgrade? Do we have enough shares reserved for the buy yet? Where are we with it?\\n\\n### Reply 9:\\nI\\'ve updated the current reservations, were about half way to opening up payments.For the R5 upgrade if we are able to raise the funds for the unit no one will be compelled to immediately purchase the upgrade kit / upgrade their shares, I will front the BTC to purchase it and if you want to upgrade your shares you can do so until the main unit ships out.\\n\\n### Reply 10:\\nI guess i should not miss R5. Reserved 10 shares and hoping to make the list this time.\\n\\n### Reply 11:\\nGlad to have you on board, the best part of R5 is that it will be shipped before R1. Kind of funny, (well the might be shipped same day but R5 is first order).We are close enough to 50 shares to open payment, if you reserved / reserve prior to me setting up the main payment check your PM\\'s for the payment address and payment amount. If you want more shares than you reserved please wait until the main payment is set up.\\n\\n### Reply 12:\\nPayment has begun, if you reserved the payment address has been sent to you with the total needed, price per share is currently $56.50.To purchase additional shares visit the DZ Miner\\'s Coop <truncated> site will make sure we don\\'t over sell as well as calculate the BTC / USD conversion for you, you are not required to create an account however it will help with order tracking, if asked for an address please make one up the only \"first name\" can be your bitcoin talk user name and please use a real email address (you may create one just for your DZ miner GB\\'s)\\n\\n### Reply 13:\\nIt\\'s a shame the Force can\\'t put more BTC into my account for more shares I stole this video from WaldoHoover\\'s GB (which I\\'m also a part of also), and the (theoretical) limit of these miners is 576 GH/s!!!

If we have to add a small heatsink - so be it. They\\'re cheap. The board is already designed for one, so it will be just a matter of choice. The goal here is to get the most hashes for the $. If adding a $5 heatsink will get us 0.5GH more then that might be worth the effort. If adding it will give us 0.1-0.2GH then maybe not as much.There were also plenty of notes on bitfury\\'s FREE MONEY thread with feedback and also a lot on the Russian thread. According to this:In our case VCore will be lower - 0.800V-0.815V at least initially. There are also various options for the clock settings - instead of 54 bits we\\'re looking at 53.Also bitfury\\'s test results using the same board - roughly translated via google-translate:So getting the 2GH is not the question. It is if the passive cooling will be sufficient. If we get better bang for the buck at 1.8GH then that may be the \"stock\" hashrate. The primary goal here is simplicity, even if that means that we may have to sacrifice a few hashes.Have in mind that those chips are quite \"overclockable\" - there is nothing stopping you from trying to get 3.2GH/s.

We actually did consider the idea initially. But the more I look at it the more I don\\'t see any real advantages.

And besides - having escrow is really no guarantee that everything will happen the way everyone expects it. (just look at what happened to all of the Avalon group-buys with escrow). Since it really serves you no advantage, while it cost (your) money, and has the potential to slow the project and other headaches - we thought we\\'d rather save ourselves the hassle.With all that said I want to add that I\\'m open to opening an escrow if that would make any difference.

There\\'s not a lack of resellers, but there\\'s a lack in demand as difficulty rises. Most demand nowadays is spurred by when the next price drop comes...To add more sellers would mean that there\\'s more useless throat cutting for 4-5 days following a price drop. There are resellers who always misprice ASICMiner gear which leads to a reduction of interested sellers on eBay for example. (Theres no margin for them). So more resellers (who are really distributors, not resellers) would wipe out those who sell on other outlets. Which will decline overall sales.ASICMiner doesn\\'t need more distributors, it needs more resellers who buy from distributors, IFF distributors would price items correctly.\\n\\n### Reply 10:\\nThis.Although for special one-time large orders for customers it would be nice if emailed friedcat wasnt Russian ruelette.\\n\\n### Reply 11:\\nBTCGuild is not selling at wholesale prices.

I\\'ve expressed my concerns with friedcat and he has agreed to consider me as another distributor.This is not a bad thing guys, it means higher availablity for buyers and less workload on the current distributors.

What makes your offering special to command a price that is more than twice the prevailing interweb market price that also offers free shipping? I\\'m just curious. Thank you in advance.\\n\\n### Reply 1:\\nThat hub would be lucky to run 4 block eruptors. It has a 2A 5V power supply, all usb asics are 2.5W, or 500mA which is USB spec. J\\n\\n### Reply 2:\\nIt just needs a beefier power supply. Once I get mine in I will find a supplier with 5v4a or 5v5a to handle 10 usb asics and then make a combo.Some people already have, or know where to get, bigger power supplies for cheap.\\n\\n### Reply 3:\\nI don\\'t trust these hubs at all. I\\'ve fried a few USB Block Erupters on them. They only run 3 erupters with the power supply it comes with. You can buy these for like $8 on eBay. I switched to the Rosewill 10-port hub ($25 a hub). They work great. I have 45 miners running on 5 hubs without a problem.\\n\\n### Reply 4:\\nLike these?<link>\\n\\n### Reply 5:\\nYep! I have a few of these hubs but only use them as daisy-chained hosts for the hubs with the BEs. The wall wart that comes with it is cheaply made; I wouldn\\'t load them to the theoretical max of 4 BEs (4 x 0.5A = 2A). Any power supply shouldn\\'t be loaded to the max anyway. They become less efficient and produces more heat (a direct result of wasted energy). I make it a point to load them between 50% and 65% which is close enough to peak efficiency (50%); up to 75% tops if I\\'m in a bind and find the need to push them.\\n\\n### Reply 6:\\nI have a wide selection. I consider the $14.99 entry level or on a budget.\\n\\n### Reply 7:\\nI\\'m sure some of you are already aware of this but Nemo1024 has done an amazing job compiling valuable data about hubs here and are discussed extensively.\\n\\n### Reply 8:\\nThat would be them.

If you have already been running the RHB-500 i would continue with that model.\\n\\n### Reply 14:\\nYou\\'re right. I was thinking the RHB-500 only had 3 amps for some reason. Anyways, I will probably buy a few RHB-500s from you. Where are they being shipped from? Shipped via Priority Mail?\\n\\n### Reply 15:\\nIt varies, but its always 2 days, on very rare occasions 3 days. If you order before Sunday night it should be there by the 2nd. If you order in the next couple hours maybe even the 1st.\\n\\n### Reply 16:\\nI carry those too.<link> I agree, Anker makes some of the best usb hubs.If anyone buys an Anker hub from me please be aware that it will not ship out until October 3rd. It comes with Free Shipping but it is 3-5 days instead of 2 days.\\n\\n### Reply 17:\\nAdrian Monk is twitching and convulsing right this very moment.\\n\\n### Reply 18:\\nOrdered some Rosewill hubs from you on Bitmit.

There would have to be a dead short for that to happen and then I\\'m amazed you didn\\'t just trip the power strip b4 it melted.Just to be clear, you haven\\'t ordered anything from me. None of the $14.99 hubs have even been delivered yet. lol\\n\\n### Reply 23:\\nYup. I did not buy any from you. I got the USB hub from a local electronic store and \"sometimes\" it comes with 1A adapter. Sometimes it doesn\\'t.The store that sells the 4A adapter \"BS\" me saying I turn it on 24/7. Saying it\\'s not supported to use 24/7. Lucky it\\'s a lady or i\\'m gonna give her a piece of my mind.So I asked for a higher amp adapter and they gave me 8A.Plug in 7 OCBE and the DC connector melted.Final form,Though I have some re-arrangement with the BEs. But all 4 hubs are running with 8A 5V adapters\\n\\n### Reply 24:\\nIts good to know that I was right about using a beefier power supply. I\\'m sorry to hear that you melted one, I\\'m betting that hub had a dead short inside.\\n\\n### Reply 25:\\nThe one I ordered for myself came in today.The psu says 1,000ma which is 1amp, yet its running 4 usb as<rest of thread truncated>\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\nReply with the hardware names, all in the same line, separated by commas.

Your alternative is BTCQuick at 7.5% fees. I already promised 1 other person a PP payment to get this GB going. I\\'ll take one more PP, which can be yours if getting BTC is too difficult. But that\\'s my limit for this R7 GB, which is 2 PP payments sent as a gift so I don\\'t have to deal w/ fees, illegal chargebacks, and fraud.The only way I\\'d take more than 2 PP gifts for this R7, is if the buyers agrees to an additional 3% Paypal fee (it\\'s normally 2.9% + 30 cents so just rounding up) over the $70 share price, so they\\'d be $72.10 instead.

Bitmine\\'s customer protection plan is that for every 10 days late they are, you get 10% extra hashrate. After 60 days lateness, they will give a full refund. We\\'ve pretty much decided too: that since we\\'ll have an extra cold A/C cabinet we\\'re overclocking the stuffings on these rigs (safely of course).I\\'m not sure how awful it\\'ll be if it comes to a full mass refund but in my dealings with Giorgio I\\'ve found him to be reasonable like an adult, instead of acting like a child like we\\'ve seen from 2 companies that were early entrants,\\n\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\nReply with the hardware names, all in the same line, separated by commas.

This means that the total cost for component 2 in the OP is now <truncated> have now begun to ship october orders (<link> Although they have had some unexpected problems with hot capacitors, and sorting this out is causing them to ship a bit slower than expected, this is generally great news. They really do seem to be doing a great job. Fingers crossed our components may begin to come through soon . The interesting thing to note in punin\\'s post is that when they open the shop again they will only be selling components that are on hand - no more pre-orders . We now have things in place that should allow us to start mining as soon as the components arrive. In addition, we have a few \"add-on\" items that should be arriving next week that will hopefully make the GB run smoothly (spare RPi, spare SD cards, a watt meter (for power consumption at the wall) and a shiny new multimeter).

In order to keep you all informed of any updates we really need to find another way to communicate in addition to the forum (we tried to start a discussion about this a while back <link> but didn\\'t get much of a response). It would be very useful to us, and to you I think, if group members could pm us with an email address that we can use to contact you. If you don\\'t do this then please be aware that we have no way to contact you if the forum goes down again.

We\\'re in the process of setting up a google+ group as well, so this may be a useful way to get updates, hashing videos etc. out there.Now for some updates:1) Bitfury burner: The FedEX notification that we received a week ago was apparently autogenerated when cryptx printed the shipping labels (<link> so as far as we know the bitfury burner has not shipped yet.

Our H-boards are in the 900s and early 1000s, so we still have a wait for these. 2) Bitfury burner: This is not going so well . We still have no update from cryptx on when this will be shipped and although there is evidence on the cryptx thread that people are getting their bitfury burners, they don\\'t seem to be coming out very quickly. I will let you know as soon as our fedex tracking details are updated and we know that the unit is on its way to us. The final thing to note about the bitfury burner is that the \"hashrate protection\" offered by cryptx looks like it will be active. There\\'s no report of them hitting the 64GH/s target yet (50-55 seems to be the limit), so group members with shares in the bitfury burner should be getting partial refunds (we\\'ll get 100 Euro back for the whole board).

My intention - to keep things fair for everyone that bought into R5 and R6 is this:Split the hashrate of the first box 50/50 between R5 and R6.Split the hasrate of the second box that\\'s supposed to arrive on Thursday 50/50 between R5 and R6.I\\'ll also split the hasrate of a third Jupiter between R5 and R6 for as many days as we were only hashing at 50%. Assuming the boxes show up when they are supposed to, that would mean I\\'ll be splitting the output of a Jupiter between R5 and R6 (and both GB\\'s would be mining at 150% or 725 Gh/s) for three days - from Thursday through Sunday some time.And if the boxes don\\'t end up showing up in a timely manner and we hit a difficulty increase, I\\'ll also split the output of a fourth Jupiter between the two GB\\'s for a couple of days -<rest of post truncated>\\n\\n### Reply 6:\\nOkay, you are just too cool.\\n\\n### Reply 7:\\nWaiting for me at home.

When that happens, will we no longer receive any payout, and do you anticipate when that might be?

I\\'m updating R1B share ownerships tonight but you\\'re all set (along w/ most of R1) and the equipment\\'s on order thanks to -R- jumping in for the last shares to up his R1B shares to 6.\\n\\n### Reply 2:\\ngood news I just paid for 2 shares. of this buy.tx id<link> my btc address.I will get rest of ups gear in order for shipping. will ship it sat/mon. the battery packs will go out in flat rate boxes. the cases will be parcel post or UPS ground. should save over 60 in shipping this way. Maybe over 75. The Extended Battery Module Would have been 1 74 pound box NJ to MO. Now it is 2 medium flat rates and a 17 box parcel post or ups ground.look like it would ship for about 45 vs 75. don\\'t know the ups yet.\\n\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\nReply with the hardware names, all in the same line, separated by commas.

Arrived Oct.7! $78 + Bonuses!\\n### Original post:\\nRedacted , what have you found about down Jupiter , what is the reason for failure , would you know ?\\n\\n### Reply 1:\\nI heard a rumor on the R6 thread that it was the PSU being overloaded.\\n\\n### Reply 2:\\nIf that is the case & magic smoke is still inside the box , redacted has other PSU he can use so it should be a easy fix , hoping for best.\\n\\n### Reply 3:\\nThe PSU had shut down - overheat I guess. We\\'re pulling something like 950 watts out of an 850 watt supply. This will not be a problem once it gets down to hosting, there are 1050 watt supplies waiting for them there. And firmware update 4 should fix this, or update5 or 6 - whatever. I\\'m waiting for a stable version where no one on the forums is complaining that it\\'s blowing up/screwing up their machines...My computer room breakers just kicked out. Don\\'t have enough juice to run 2 Jupiters and a Saturn with the other stuff I\\'m running. I\\'m quite sure I can\\'t run that other Jupiter - will get it sent on it\\'s way to hosting at bobsag3 on Tuesday morning. Now I\\'m going to see if I can manage to run one Jupiter and the Saturn....Just got a Netgear WN2500 set up as a bridge to my Belkin WiFi net. Too many boxes and not enough ports.....More pictures later....-R-\\n\\n### Reply 4:\\nThis is why I have 12 spare routers. or more... I havent counted\\n\\n### Reply 5:\\nCan\\'t you move one machine to a different circut in your house. Hate to see you loose the coins and I don\\'t even have shares in this one\\n\\n### Reply 6:\\nYes we are mining this weekend. PSU works just fine now that it had a chance to cool off a little.But... I won\\'t be pointing a second machine to our BTCGuild accounts. It\\'s going down to hosting and will run from there. Once it\\'s running there, I\\'ll be matching the amounts that we\\'ve mined, and doing the first payout. The BTC payout match I\\'m doing makes up for only having 50% of the hardware running for this first payout period. However much we\\'ve made at 50%, I\\'ll be matching that to give 100% payouts to everyone, and we\\'ll have 100% hardware running from there on out.If I point another machine at the group buy accounts right now, I\\'m not going to able to tell how much I need to match to bring everyone up to 100%. So, until Tuesday morning this machine will be mining for me, to make some of the coins that I\\'ll need to pay out when I do the match. So two machines ARE running for the group buys, it\\'s just that I\\'ll be paying out the other machines coins to the group buy wallets once we hit 100% hardware.....-R-\\n\\n### Reply 7:\\nYes - I have an extension cord run across my apartment to a 30 amp circuit behind my washing machine. The wife is OK with that (just barely) as long as it will only be there until Tuesday morning.And I currently testing firmware revision on my Saturn and the second Jupiter. If that all seems to run OK, I\\'ll upgrade the one that\\'s mining for the group buy at the moment....-R-\\n\\n### Reply 8:\\nI have no idea how your wife is ok with that- my cats would throw a shit fit, like they do at the ethernet cable I had to run up the stairs at my apartment.\\n\\n### Reply 9:\\nWell, like I said, she\\'s just barely OK with that. But she won\\'t be cooking as long as that \"orange thing\" is running across her living room. So I get to take her out to eat for all the meals between now and when I ship the machine down to hosting and remove the extension cord....\\n\\n### Reply 10:\\nThank you so much! I can imagine the setup and the heat !\\n\\n### Reply 11:\\nThe second Jupiter got dropped somewhere along the way. It\\'s hard to see how bad this dent in the case is because the material is so reflective, so the pictures don\\'t show it very well. But trust me, it took one hell of a bashing to bend up and make a dent like that in the aluminum case....This one shows it a little better, I think.\\n\\n### Reply 12:\\nHoly crap- through the box?

As far as the ebay thing, most people have done that over and over, I did over 400 units myself all on ebay (mainly from silentsonicboom btw,. thanks for fast shipping/great packing), and took looses when the price changed here and either I hadn\\'t sold out yet, or was waiting on pre-order. It\\'s a gamble. However for the currency to really survive, it needs to be disassociated with other currencies, in fact it shouldn\\'t be 1BTC = $166, it should be $166 = 1BTC, making BTC the driving factor, the foundation, the (insert word here cause I forget it) causing things like this:IF everyone in the wold chooses BTC for global reserve status, add another 0 to it\\'s value (in comparison to USD), making people who have stockpiles of BTC ridiculously rich.Now is that cool? Heck no, I\\'m an American and it makes us weak in comparison to the world, devaluating our economy and making us poorer in the whole world scheme of things. What am I going to do about it?

What friedcat sells at now is apparently profitable by a decent margin. Think back to before... June 23rd for instance, he was selling them for .99 BTC per. Can\\'t even imagine what his margins were back then... And couldn\\'t understand back then why people were lining up to buy so many of them? Even more shocking, I saw someone thanking one of Friedcat\\'s US resellers for selling him hundreds of them just recently! Is there any way those things can turn a profit? I mean for the buyer?

I can get the asic blade shipped to me in under 3 days and be hashing immediately.I would have to wait 2+ weeks to receive a Red Fury. We should see asic blades drop below 3btc each within 2 weeks.Also difficulty of bitcoin will go up quite a bit in 2 weeks. We all know the more time it takes to get an asic the less you will make and the chance of making ROI goes down dramatically.Its pretty obvious if you are going to be buying mining hardware that you should get an asic blade.Can anyone counter this argument?\\n\\n### Reply 26:\\nYes. If you haven\\'t got 3.65btc then for less that 1btc this is the best you are going to get.\\n\\n### Reply 27:\\nDon\\'t forget blades aren\\'t the most user friendly for new miners.\\n\\n### Reply 28:\\nConfirmed orders updated! Closing in on 200 units sold\\n\\n### Reply 29:\\nI can counter this.... you can still get usb erupters for about the same cost as blades. 30 erupters @ .12 is about 10GH for 3.6BTC. Shipped tomorrow . Still user friendly and about exact same cost of blades. I think people are looking longer term with red fury\\'s based on the insanely low electricity. It is negligible when we\\'re talking about 1-2 units, but when you venture off into the 333 Gh range @1k units =2500 kw/h month ($250/month @.10) which is no longer pennies. Same hashing power can be bought with red furry\\'s for 7.5 x less electricity, consequently bringing electricity down to 33<rest of thread truncated>\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\nReply with the hardware names, all in the same line, separated by commas.

Any advances made in the price of BTC since you bought your share(s) will be applied to extra hashrate per share at no extra charge! This same situation led to 9% extra hashrate being slated to be spread amongst R7 share owners since we had enough funds on hand to buy our target hashrate of 800GH/s with only 91 shares bought.This still leaves open the possibility of a Round 8B for extra Bitmine modules for the R7 rig after October 31.\\n\\n### Reply 4:\\n$60 for 10-15gh/s/ is a pretty damn good deal.

SOLD OUT\\n### Original post:\\nEDIT 2013-06-30: We\\'ve asked John K to verify our identities. You can find his posts here: <link> the successfull groupbuy in the pre-buy period, we decided to start another groupbuy for the second batch of KNC Jupiter miners that will be released. Unlike the first groupbuy there is no delivery date set yet for these miners so it has a higer risk.Learning from our earlier groupbuy we made a few changes. First of the share price. On the first groupbuy shareprice was 0.50 BTC. We still saw a lot of people only buying one share and some having trouble getting the 0.50 BTC. So, we decided instead of putting 120 shares in a miner we\\'ll split it into 240. Last time we had bad luck with the BTC price. What we do this time is set the share price slightly higher. Any difference in the final price of the miner will be added to first payout (after first expenses are deducted but before issue to ADDICTION). Price is therefore set at 0.30 BTC per share.Another difference is the ADDICTION asset on Bitfunder. We will be releasing this asset shortly for everyone who joined the first groupbuy. Because delivery of these miners is later than the first batch, we can\\'t and won\\'t issue new ADDICTION sha<rest of post truncated>\\n\\n### Reply 1:\\nAnd Miner08 is bought - TX <truncated> 1 has 12 MinersGroupbuy 2 has 8 MinersTotal of 20x400GHs\\n\\n### Reply 2:\\ni\\'ll buy a sharedo i need a bitfund account or?\\n\\n### Reply 3:\\nHey rusty,We just closed this groupbuy today.

I paid 24BTC for it and have just put in a request for a refund (doubt i will get it) but if i don\\'t I am going to use it. Was wondering if it would be in anyway useful to the mining power of this GB.You are more than welcome to say no, as a matter of fact anyone else can say no too - i was just mentioning it to see if it can in anyway add to our total hash.\\n\\n### Reply 8:\\nHey guys,@btceic, thank you for the compliment! We are planning a new groupbuy, but with the current BTC prices we feel we should wait at least a bit to see if it goes down more or stabilizes. If we were to do the same groupbuy again, we\\'d have to raise the shareprice to at least 0.42 to ensure we don\\'t have to add our own money again. We\\'ve had to do that twice and even though we\\'ll get it back when the miners arrive it\\'s starting to become quite an amount @KSV with regards to the BFL miner; we can add hashing power but at a set \"price\" per GH as described in the IPO agreement. One addiction share equals 32.23MH, so we could issue 50.000 / 32.23 =~ 1550 addiction shares at market price if we add the miner. At current price that means 1550 * .0111 = 17.2 BTC. We would also require that the miner would be physically added to the existing ones. So as things are standing now, we can\\'t But we\\'ll have to see how things look when we start hashing..Cheers\\n\\n### Reply 9:\\nWould you consider $usd vs btc to help spread the risk do to the current volatility?\\n\\n### Reply 10:\\nActually yes, we\\'ve been thinking of using paypal. The only problem is costs arent transparent. I\\'ve done a paypal transaction last GB, which ended up with little over 5% transaction fees! This was due to payment coming from another continent i believe. The receiver has to pay the costs.We could do paypal, but then we\\'d have to make sure we can buy a whole miner thru paypal before anyone actually sends any money. Any ideas are welcome..Cheers\\n\\n### Reply 11:\\nSomeone else mentioned paying as a gift gets around the fees in PayPal? but not sure if that works.

Thomas bought a few shares so this Round so that the ordered hashrate could be kicked up to 600GH/s for Round 8! For the co-op: We were able to take advantage of the rise in price of BTC to lock in a payment just a little north of the $200 USD mark.Ergo: your hashrate just became more valuable due to the rise of BTC\\'s value since your payment(s). You directly benefit without any additional cost!We\\'ll sort out just how much hashrate bonuses you guys scored once we have final numbers but the calculation for payouts in R8 will be:1) Proportion of HashRate for R8 is: Total Hashrate - Round 7 Hashrate = Round 8 HashRate.1400GH/s - 800 GH/s = 600 GH/s Nominal HashRate This is therefore equivalent to 42.86% of the Bitmine\\'s combined Hashrate and concomitant payouts. This is assuming we were unable to split hashrate fairly between R7/R8 at these exact proportions in software.2) Within Round 8, after fees of 2.75% hosting/management fees are applied, the payout calculation per miner is:Total BTC Mined * Your Shares / Total R8 shares PAID = Your R8 payoutEx. 10 BTC Mined by R8 modules. 24 shares PAID out of 48 SOLD in R8.

Therefore:R8 Share ~= 600 GH/s / 47 shares = 12.76 GH/s ea.R8 Share - Turbo ~= 960GH/s / 47 shares = 17.87 GH/s ea.Not too shabby for $60 and with all of our exclusive co-op bonuses included.Remember: These are estimates and if the hardware is behaving well, we\\'ll see about getting even more hashrate without damaging our equipment.\\n\\n### Reply 2:\\nDoesn\\'t seem like we are going to hit the 75 shares unless there is a huge spike\\n\\n### Reply 3:\\nWELL this one is too far down the road for most of us.

That means a Round could show as out of stock, even when it\\'s really not.- Because of this, and since this is all the same Bullet Run with ample stock at the moment, we set up stock with backorders allowed, so that people wouldn\\'t be locked out of making an order due to double or phantom orders.We\\'re in talks with two good programmers to redesign and relaunch our site.

Companies like Costco & Walmart are able to offer the prices they can because they have such huge economies of scale and order at such volumes that it affords them a much stronger position when negotiating with suppliers (sometimes to the detriment of the supplier in Walmart\\'s case). This allows them special considerations, lower pricing, exclusives, etc., etc.. and the lower costs get passed on to you.What you\\'re seeing here is the same type of purchasing power that is afforded to larger entities. Group Buys are a logical conclusion for those miners that see the benefit in banding together their purchasing power to allow them access to either higher quantities (think: volume discounts) or plain access to a high priced product that couldn\\'t be easily purchased by the Group individually. For a Group Buyer, access to a small, ready pool of equit<rest of post truncated>\\n\\n### Reply 1:\\nI just missed your run. I tried to contact you through ebay so i could get a hold of some Sierra shares. But, i guess sold already. Any upcoming GB\\'s\\n\\n### Reply 2:\\nHi umdorado,I\\'m sorry I missed you! My wife usually mentions if an ebay msg. comes in via email notification, as that\\'s her account & I just list things there for sale & buy electronics occasionally. She said she didn\\'t get a notice, so that\\'s odd.Thomas (user: thomas_s ) will likely be leading the charge on the next round, Round 5, when he feels ready, or he\\'s also free to branch off on his own and start his own thread. I\\'m taking a little break on GBs as I\\'m still getting caught up from selling 3 HashFast miners in about a week. You wouldn\\'t believe how much work it is behind the scenes for these things. I\\'m planning to do more of an assist role if he decides to team up again for a 3rd co-GB, so if you\\'re interested in another round of at-cost HashFast shares, I\\'d send him a PM with your interest. I\\'d say the more PMs he receives in interest for a R5, the more likely he\\'d be to run one. Edit: It\\'s crazy to think I helped sell $30K worth of 4 HashFast miners in about 5 weeks since I wrote this; especially when I had never done GBs before in my life and now I can set up escrowed GBs for GB shares for new GBCs that need this service. Cheers!\\n\\n### Reply 3:\\nI\\'d say that working with Thomas, bobsag3, and -Redacted- has worked out well to provide great Group Buy values and improvements.Only 1 month and 4 days later: we nearly quadrupled our sales from $30K to $112K! I can only assume that people are interested in getting access to the best value miners at the lowest possible costs via Group Buys.==And as always - don\\'t forget that when in doubt: use escrow!\\n\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\nReply with the hardware names, all in the same line, separated by commas.

This corresponds to all BTC mined (0.314947 BTC) before we added the BFSB starter kit (component 1). Please see below for the details.

Over the first 2-3 days it crashed a couple of times with a particular \"usb_write error on avalon_write\" error that seems to be common with these boards (based on reports on the forum) and this could only be recovered by re-flashing the firmware. I noticed at this point that the firmware that was controlling the fan speed was keeping this rather low and switched to powering the fan directly from a 12V supply. This is a little louder, but has significantly reduced the board temp and things have been running stable since. Keep your fingers crossed that it stays this way! It really feels as though these boards are pushing the chips to their limits, so we\\'re not going to tinker with this hardware now, just let it get on with things. On the cryptx thread there are reports of a couple of people getting their \"hashrate protection\" cashback. We\\'ve not had this yet, but when we do we will let you know before sending an appropriately sized refund back to those who contributed to this component.BFSB starter kit and H-boards: So far the BFSB kit has been very reliabl<rest of post truncated>\\n\\n### Reply 8:\\nForgive my confusion here, but I thought the deal was supposed to be that earlier investors would be getting paid before later investors.

A lot of \\'em.I, for one, will *never* deal with unprofessional, uncaring Avalon and BFL.Yesterday, I had a phone call with John S., the head of marketing at HashFast. I found him to be a true marketing professional. He appeared to care about his clients, and I found it easy enough to work with him to convince him to let us have access to HashFast Flash Sale pricing up until Friday night thanks to a partially reserved 4th miner, even though the sale ended last night.Contrast that with Inaba fro BFL & Yifu from Avalon.

The group buy I was in has opted for a refund, and I\\'ve got thousands of dollars in Klondike components sitting around and waiting for Avalon chips. I don\\'t imagine I\\'m the only one in this situation.

So here I am. :-)\\n\\n### Reply 4:\\nExcellent!

This will be after all units are shipped so you guys who have units on the way keep ahold of your tracking number. Also if you paid a price of $129 each or less per unit you will not be eligible for the manufacturer discount.

I have a clean personal track record i have been fbi background checked and fingerprinted many times during working as a Nurse.

We also expect a number of R13 GB share owners to move their refund or R13 order to this round, and they will be given priority for R15 shares.The closest thing to a reservation for R15 and R15B is to buy 4 shares and send a tiny BTC payment to hold that wallet address and order from expiring after 1 hour.BTW, for those asking, this order was made this weekend, and we are Order #1068xx.\\n\\n### Reply 10:\\nK.

For example, when I go to <link> I see a screenshot of something that looks like Google docs and some gross stats below it. Am I missing some painfully obvious feature? Sorry, my first try at shares\\n\\n### Reply 13:\\nThat\\'s not a google doc, thats a spreadsheet that was converted to a jpg and uploaded. The spreadsheet changes frequently so I don\\'t upload them.Theres only 1 address missing from 9-12 and its one of the management people so, yea good job customers for getting it all submitted before us.\\n\\n### Reply 14:\\nPM sent to thomas_s\\n\\n### Reply 15:\\nPayment for order 626 sent. Thanks.\\n\\n### Reply 16:\\nDZ, I sent you a PM yesterday about something else (another GB) but R15 went to these 2 Jupiters. Maybe you can PM me an email address you read too, I have some different ideas. Thanks.\\n\\n### Reply 17:\\nOrder: #631 : Payement sent.Cheers !\\n\\n### Reply 18:\\nI\\'m temporarily taking R15 down, based on the site\\'s wallet it seems its highly possible its full and I don\\'t have time to confirm.If it is we will see about getting another jupiter.\\n\\n### Reply 19:\\nAnd you really had to do this while I was adding 6 shares to my order? :| Please put me on a waiting list then.\\n\\n### Reply 20:\\nI am wondering if anyone is interested in selling any of your shares in existing DZ MC co-ops? (ones that are currently hashing....)If so please PM me with your price, shares and rate. I understand there is a small transfer fee for the work involved, I would of course pay this fee.Thanks!\\n\\n### Reply 21:\\nWe have 2 on order right now, and if thomas is correct and they are both full, I will make another order for another 2 this morning.
