Now, much of this buyer's funds may be used for Round 7 or another Round. 5-10 R1B shares will likely be kept by this buyer.B. To offset these shares going out: baros008 has 8 or 10 R2B shares moving to R1B that's currently sitting in the R2B wallet. I'm awaiting word as to whether he prefers 8 or 10 R1B shares. I've also given him access to my eight R1B shares since he was kind enough to move his 8 R2B shares to here (or to the target HF wallet) when it we became oversold in Round 2B.C. I've also been hearing from R1 folks starting to filter back to the GB forum (some were lost, sorry about that; R2 was a spur of moment decision).

We all need to realize that John has a lot of demands on him and he does have a life too, just like anyone else. I had offered to team up with John previously but then decided to just launch my services and focus on this forum (and to a lesser extent the Custom Hardware forum).You & I have worked together before, and I do offer my Escrowed share services to anyone participating in a GB even if they joined a GB that doesn't have an Escrow Agent or Service set up previously.If I was looking for escrow services I'd recommend Dabs and SebastianJu, but in the future, if you're in a hurry & you want to send folks my way to do semi-automated escrowed GB shares (with manual release of funds by buyer) I'll be more than happy to help out your Group Buyers. For escrowed sale transactions my response time is 24 hours or less. For people wanting escrow protection & GBCs needing access to acquisition funds (perhaps to make a mfg. downpayment to secure a miner?) I'll make the time on their behalf.At the moment...we've just closed out GBs with me in an assist mode for R5/R6, so I do have time to help people outside of my Cooperative (in fact, I'm vetting another potential new GBC) . If you have a big enough need, even if one's a competitor GBC here, I'll do my best to help you as quickly as I can.Cheers,DZ\n",

The clients will get further confirmation about the quantity and bitcoin address through email. ---I have ordered a 50 4-module Avalon batch #3 for a group order. I have to order such amount to be able to pay in RMB bank wiring. My order is a mix of group order and mining farm plan, we want to resell 15 units of them. So anyone want to buy a Avalon please PM me or post in this thread to ask question. my order number is 4929. If you want to buy a Avalon Batch #3 now when the stock sold-out and want to hold it in hand, I will ship it to you after all the 50 units arrive. Before the all arrive point, I will mine on the machine and the owner of the 50 Avalon will get the mining reward proportionally according to their ownership. The electricity is 0.25USD/kwh and the hosting fee is 10% of the mining revenue.the shipping fee will be paid before the package is ready to go. The buyer should be responsible for all potential tax liability and shipping cost. The minimum ordering size is a 4 module units with PSU. The price for each unit is 110BTC. PM me your email address and we can exchange the paying address and shipping address.If you want to participate the mining venture but don't want to spend the time to manage it, I will host the mining machine for you in China. The electricity is 0.25USD/kwh and the hosting fee is 10% of the mining revenue. PM me your bitcoin receiving address and I will give you an address to pay. The minimum ordering size is 1 module, which will share the PSU with other modules. The price for each module is 28 BTC and if you buy 4 modules, the price will be 110BTC. You can get your single module whenever you want, but you can not have a 1/4 PSU. and if you have 4 modules you can get a whole Avalon machine home with the PSU. Questions are welcomed.\n",

Considering the amount of people and BTC's involved in the batch 3 delay i'm surprised that no one has sued Yifu yet.My opinion is that it would be good to come to some sort of agreement about the dividend payment frequency. The way i see it we have two options (beside current):1. periodic payouts - <truncated> payments2. payments when a certain amount is reached - when x BTC threshold is reached, dividend is payed.In this way it would be more or less clear when we can expect coins.

There is no waiting as a part of some groupbuy, thereis no if module will be delivered on time, there is no if module will actualy work once delivered. It is hardware on yourhands right now. As such, it can be immidiately used to mine some SHA256 altcoin and, given current rates, it can earnmore than 0.75 BTC in very short period of time.

If you feel unhappy and any other negative emotions, I think it is real and I am really sorry. First I am seriously busy and working under high pressure, and there is something inside me that make things worse.What happened: I have actually abandoned not only the thread, and also the mining farm. I don't have the time to take care of the unstable Avalon machines. I know there had been some miners mining, while more stopped mining. I did not have the time and incentive to repair it, or even logged into the pool account or remote access to check the status. And this April, the partners who provide the hosting room called me and discussed with me. He wants to stop the hosting operation and I thought I should follow his willing. So the mining farm has been shut down.My ignorance of the hosting service duty is a price I have to pay, to make more important things happen and succeed. I will be responsible for your lose.The last dividend was paid at 2013/12/20. According to my tools, from the 2013/12/20 and until the end of the life time of Avalon module, the life time earnings of the Avalon Gen-1 module will be 0.454 BTC. I will payout all the mining revenue without charging any more hosting fees. To show an attitude, I will pay out more than twice this number, which is 0.999 BTC per module. <link> the hashrate=22.5GH/s, power consumption=202W, electricity cost = 0.2USD/kwh and BTC exchange rate =1000, pool fee=2%I will lock this thread in the next 48 hours.

      "SHARES REMAINING 0/10 @ 11.33 AM CENTRAL TIME, MONDAY 6/3/2013This group buy is intended to let less Bitcoin fortunate forum members take part in the opportunity to purchase cheap hash-rate through the recently launched Metabank Bitfury. The bitfury (<link> is available with US shipping through this thread: <link> (from several reputable forum members located in Moscow, offering purchase and shipping to the US). I have structured the purchase so that members wanting to get access to the exceptionally cheap hash rate/GH that the bitfury offers can take secure has rate from one of the machines without spending the full BTC30 for a purchase. Offering:- 10 shares of BTC3 are available.- Each share entitles the owner to 1/12th of the BTC proceeds from a Bitfury mining 24/7 for 24 months, payment will be made to the address of the share-holder weekly, bi-weekly or monthly (I am flexible here) - The 2 outstanding shares will be owned by OP as payment for power/maintenance of the miner and peripheral hardware needed (UPS, possible router etc). - After 24 months the miner will be considered 'spent' and become the property of OP (this is for reason of simplicity mostly, since I believe BTC difficulty in 2 years will essentially render the miner a warm paper weight). IF hash rate increases VERY quickly and I feel that the share holders can make more money selling the ASIC before the 24 months are up I reserve the right to take a vote among share holders (majority rules) on doing so.IN CASE OF NON DELIVERY: I take no responsibility for the possibility that Metabank does not deliver the miner. I have done what I consider a thorough due diligence but as we all know, you can never 100% guarantee anything when it comes to pre-orders. If I have forgotten anything or you require more info etc. Please feel free to ask/post in this thread. I will only be doing this ONE group buy as I do not wish to run multiple miners as chances are I would not have time to look after them properly. EDIT: In the interest of time I have removed the Escrow part of this group purchase and will be making the purchase directly through my own address. I have done many deals in the past without negative feedback and BTC30 certainly not a sum I think anyone would assume that I would trade a scammer tag for. If you are interested in buying one or more shares here is what you need to do:1. Send payment to the following address: <truncated> Send me a PM stating your sending address and BTC amount sent. One share = BTC3 3. Post your share purchase here to make it easier for visitors to see when a share is claimed. I will also update this post with remaining shares every 20 minutes or so.After payment has been received for all 10 shares I will do the following:1. Contact Bitcentury (<link> and make payment for the miner. 2. Contact all share buyers with confirmation of purchase, a copy of <truncated> from BitCentury for the purchase and a screenshot of the transaction. 3. I will also supply buyers with my physical address and a possibly slightly redacted scan of my passport if requested. I will ask share holders to keep this information confidential.EDIT: IF all shares are sold but the Bitfury miner sells out before we have time to place a first batch order I will refund any share holders their bitcoin - 5% for transaction fees and oranization of the group buy. I hope this seems like a fair solution should this happen.Edit; I am going to bed. Any orders placed in the next 8 hours will be confirmed at approx 9 am Central time. Please post in thread when ordering so that possible new orders do not pay for shares that are not available. If this still happens I will refund BTC to sending addresses within 24 hours.Edit; I have 1 share that I am 'holding' for a buyer for up to 2 more hours. If this share is not payed for I will re-open the sale. I am also negotiating with Bitcentury reg. the price of the Miner. They stated BTC30 last night but have since raised the price to BTC2 no doubt due to the drop in BTC price. I have confidence we can still order the miner at the original BTC30 and should they not honor the original price I will personally cover the BTC2 additional and take a vote among share holders on how to solve this. No need to worry though, I can assure you I am easy to work with and want to see this miner delivered on schedule and start mining. I will post a new update in roughly 2 hours, at which time I also hope to be able to send final verification of everyone's shares and order the miner.Edit; I have decided to pick up the last share of the auction for myself at this point to be able to place the order asap. I am now only waiting for email verification of the price of the miner and I will place the order. Edit; Order has been placed! More info coming shortly via PM.Edit; Ok, I have gotten email confirmation on our order from BitCentury. They will send out contracts 'in a few hours' and I will distribute copies + other 'proof' of our ownership. Heading to late lunch! Edit;Here is the full list of Share holders and transactions. From now on, if you wish to change your payout address for BTC mined or anything else I will require requests as signed messages using your verified address.

You said later than any excess will be returned to the purchasers, so is this conversion done at the moment of purchase?What will your timing be from moment of reviving the miner to having it up and running in the DC? A week? 24 hours?\"management fees are 2.5 % of BTC mined after expenses are deducted.(expenses include but are not limited too, hosting, repairs, shipping, taxes)\" So 2.5% includes the expenses such as hosting and repairs?

DZ MC Jupiter below-cost shares went for $78 for 4-6GH/s albeit at an earlier delivery date.However, the Bitmine Rig has a native turbo mode (speed unknown), and we'll seek to go even fast then this, if we can push the limits safely without risking our hardware. Thanks to the work of 4 co-op GBCs teaming up (and with the help of a college full of engineers helping bobsag3 out next door), the DZ MC is having a specially built A/C cooled cabinet within an already cooled facility, so that we can push hashrate & improve our chances of finding blocks.==With that said: 10 shares available.1 more hour before payment. I thought the deadline for free shipping was last night but its in about 90 minutes.==Semi-OT: but I've vetted a 9th GB Coordinator and/or ASIC miner host! This is the first GBC I've vetted from Asia.He's already an active GBC with a successful track record, but he contacted me for my free vetting services. If he so chooses, he's now also free to team up with our co-op's 5 GBCs (so far) to pre-reserve chunks of future ASIC miners to help bring low costs and the best values to Group Buyers.\n",

      "Hi Etienne,There is no real deadline on this. However, these units are now scheduled for shipping today/tomorrow from Black Arrow and expected to be hashing by Wednesday/Thursday. For those that join later, their payouts will be prorated based on how many days they were fully PAID in that mining period.For example: if they buy their share 7 days into the mining period, they would receive about half of that period's payout per share.==We may be offering cloudhashing for this and have plans in the works for pro cloudhashing with other investors and co-ops, completely separate from our at-cost GBs here. If we branch out into cloudhasing this would be operated on a separated site, with full incorporation. It would still be priced to the best values out there in that niche.So...that is what's going to go on with some of any extra unsold hardware.\n",

It'd all be through Cointerra IV hardware which is already scheduled for production. I wasn't thinking company and related are very important - a GH/s is a GH/s, and if insured, it doesn't really matter who's making it or what the hardware is, so long as it's meeting specs. CT is semi-publicly taking bids on ~1/4 of end-of-year production which hasn't yet been snagged by a big player (though they're receiving a good few bids).Someone could load up Skype, PM Ravi and just say \"here's the money, I want it all,\" and figure out what smaller customers want after the fact, or equilibrium could be established, which I'd think is best both for consumer and middlemen.\n",

I think I may've poisoned the well by posting this in Group Buys (and my writing is particularly unclear today).Maybe rephrasing the question would help -- Okay, so let's say that on January 18th, a fellow is going door-to-door selling hashpower in some magical accounting form which just credits your Bitcoin account with dividends based on the hashpower you purchase. He's from - Idunno, AMD, and this is an official AMD service, with specs and consistent dividends fully guaranteed by some mythical, trustworthy insurance firm.

      "Ordered one of these from MineForeman and after some thought I'd see about facilitating a group buy to the UK if their is demand enough for it.I obviously don't have much kudos, but I've been lurking quite a while. If we go ahead we can use an escrow, I'm sure we can find a trustworthy member that people would be comfortable with, unless people wish to place their trust in me. I'm happy to reveal my identity within reason if we don't use an escrow to assuage anyone's fears.I'd be using Royal Mail Special Delivery so everyone would get their ASICs as soon as possible. Granted this isn't the cheapest delivery, but it is the most reliable and fully insured.I'm obviously not looking to make a killing here, but I would like consideration for my time and I'd like to be able to get a few of these for myself as part of compensation for me posting on each individual order.Right now this post is just to see if there is enough interest to raise to the limit of 50. I'm happy to facilitate an order of any quantity, truth is I have no idea how strong the demand is for these little gadgets here in the UK. Please leave a reply or PM me if you are interested, stating the amount you would like and if we reach a good number we can quickly proceed. I'm really interested in supporting the community so hopefully this will be a way to gain some standing and trust here.They'd be priced at 2.5 BTC and posted next-day insured.

      "In the pictures, it appears that each hashing module has a ribbon connection and 1x 8pin power input. I was wondering if all the modules require 8 pin connections, or will 6pin work? I am curious since the picture appears to use 8pin on one or two modules and 6pin (without the 2 extra pins available) connectors for the other modules. The description also says \"3 +12V DC input\" for power; is this accurate?Further, the PSU supplied is 1k W and the A1 is clocked for 1TH. Does this imply that the efficiency is better than 1G/W, as there is usually some extra power being used (to run control board for example)?Finally, if one puts a more powerful PSU in, what are the options for <truncated> Does the manufacturer put in a kill switch when one tries to OC/UC, or is it an easy task of changing clock settings and cooling the device properly?

      "Thank you for your consideration and good questions. As I answer you in QQ, I do answer again here for others.All the modules is 6 pin connections, the one u see as 8 pin, actually another 2 pin are not connected. Connectors from PSU to power are about 25 pin.In addition, our item is not overclock from the factory. One a1 chip's speed is 20-35 GH. We set its speed at 32GH. So it made 1024 GH/machine. We dont neither overclock nor underclock our item. And definitely, we do not recommend you to overclock or underclock device.If you want to overclock, we can make unit unlocks from the manufacturer for you in special case, but the warranty would be canceled. By the way, the PSU may not enough to support the overclock, so you have to change the PSU by yourself. The miner's power consumption is now 950watt and the factory plans that the PSU may be changed from 1k Watt to 1100-1200W.Finally, we do not sell products without PSU for lower price because we have to test all miners for setting and running them before shipment.\n",

For my opnion, others factories are the same.- circuit schematics will be provided to customers? His is required for maintenance and/or repairWe cant provide circuit schematics as a secret of our factory. In case, its need to repair, pls send its back to us. - what is required to 'unlock' a miner to allow overclocking?For A1 chip, it is locked from the factory and highly recommended to do not unlock. We had pretested and tried out in every ways and found out this miner is very stable at 1TH with our spec of material. If you want to unlock for overclock, we recommend to use AVALON GEN3 chip which is designed for overclock miner. However, our factory still do not release the AVALON GEN3 miner, sorry about that.- with several manufacturers producing these clones why should I choose qiang? Web GUI is in Chinese, unproven, no LCD screen, 1kw PSU only (lketc dragons are now shipped with 1.2kw PSU) and price is essentially the same. We are 100% brand new and first hand product. We dont mine with them waiting for customers come to pick them up. We can provide a translation of Web GUI for our customers. No LCD to reduce a cost because LCD dont help to mine BTC ,just show stat. For PSU, the factory has changed them to 1300kw PSU within box of 1100kw PSU, because these PSU spec we special order from a PSU factory, but they dont have 1,300 kw box for a while. However you can prove by open the box or use meter.For the price, we try to lower its as much as we can. We guarantee our good quality, good after sale service, good material with reasonable price. We extremely cannot reduce price anymore. Its up to the customers to choose what product and service are suitable for them.

      "posts:\n",
      "date: 2014-01-10\n",
      "Hello Guys,I want to do a group-buy for 2-5 KNC Neptunes. Right now I have funds for 1 Neptune outright.I will sell 32 shares per Neptune.Each Share is 0.50 BTC each *Hosting is Free for first 20 months.Since I have very little shame in my game, I have somewhat copied Charles999's post as his business plan is logical and agreeable.The Neptune for this GROUP Buy has been paid. It's one of the earliest orders and a DAY One order so we are sure to be one of the first to get the units. If you are considering other groupbuys, please ask them if their Neptune unit has been paid for. All orders that were not paid has been canceled by KncMiner. Also ask them if their unit is part of the Batch 1 group as the second batch is expected to arrive 3-4 weeks after the First batch. 3-4 weeks of lost revenue could mean thousands of lost $$$. Due to BTC recent price fall, the price per share is now .55 BTC. All previous orders will retain their share rights. All new share purchases will need to send .55 BTC per share. Date and time stamp is: December 02, 2013, 11:21:24 AM This group buy is intended to let forum members take part in the opportunity to purchase cheap hash-rate through the recently launched KNC Miner Neptune(<link> company located in Stockholm, Sweden. The unit that the shares relate to is the KNC Neptune advertised for 3,000 GH/s (<link> I have structured the purchase so that members wanting to get access to the exceptionally cheap hash rate/GH that the Neptune offers can secure hash rate from one of the machines without paying the full purchase price. Each share you purchase will get you that percentage of what the Miner generates. All utility and maintenance cost will be paid by me.Offering:- 32 shares of BTC .55 each are available.- Each share is worth approximately 100 ghs of hashing power- Each share entitles the owner to 1/32 of the BTC proceeds from a KNC Miner Neptune mining 24/7 for 20 months*, payment will be made to the address of the shareholders weekly. (* Miner breaking after 12 month warranty, random acts of nature like datacenter burns down etc.,internet downtime, not covered in 24/7 for 20 months(should not be a problem))- After 20 months we will consider decommissioning the miner if it is no longer profitable to run. - Also the group as a whole will have ownership of the unit. During our group ownership, if an opportunity presents itself to sell the unit early, we will put it up for a vote. If more than 60% agrees to sell the unit early. We will sell and everyone will get their split according to the shares they own. I personally feel this is the fairest deal and its what separates us from other offers. Provided by Groupbuy Host:- The unit will be properly cooled at a temperature of 65-77 F degrees 24/7. The unit will also be connected to a UPS at all times to ensure theres no electrical issues. - Electricity, UPS, Power supply and other material required to host the units.- All hosting and support services will be handled by me. -IN CASE OF NON DELIVERY: I take no responsibility for the possibility that KNC Miner does not deliver the miner. I have done what I consider a thorough due diligence but as we all know, you can never 100% guarantee anything when it comes to pre-orders. To purchase shares:= CLOSED - PM me/and post the transaction ID (txid) in this thread. ONLY use sending addresses you fully control. I will use the sending address for BTC payouts for your share ownership and if you request change of payout address I will require that you can sign your share purchase address to make this happen OR I WILL NOT CHANGE THE RECEIVING ADDRESS. This is for your own protection.If I have forgotten anything or you require more info etc. Please feel free to ask/post in this thread.\n",

      "I have completed a detailed explanation of how layouts are structured, you can view the documentation here Details On Outlay per Share - How You Get PayedThe simplest version that I can offer is thus:A total of 100 BTC invested in a given HPC (Hardware Purchase Cycle), the mining hardware has generated a 100 BTC profit that is designated to be split in the Profit Sharing Pool for the given HPC. Total BTC invested = 100 BTC, Profit Sharing Pool = 100 BTC, so we divide Total BTC invested (100 BTC) by Profits from pool (100 BTC), or, 100/100 BTC = 1 BTC.Price of Founders Contract is 1.5 BTC, 1.5 BTC x 1 BTC = 1.5 BTC - So the credit per Founders Contract is 1.5 BTCPrice of Standard Contract is 0.5 BTC, 0.5 BTC x 1 BTC = 0.5 BTC - So the credit per Standard Contract is 0.5 BTCThe same process is used to determine the layout credits for BitShare <truncated> on the Rollover options you choose you will see different layouts, to understand these terms thoroughly you should read the The SolarWind Mining Company Investment ProgramI am changing the mining rig back to a Jupiter KnCMiner due to a negative email I have received from Bitmine.
