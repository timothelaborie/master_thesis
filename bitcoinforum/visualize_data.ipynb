      "Speaking from very limited experience, the couple of S17 boards I've seen and repaired the solder quality was appalling. I expect the S19 are of similar quality. With a few thermal cycles and transportation vibration I'm hardly surprised that they end up failing.I think they must use OSP on their bare boards before reflow it leaves a nasty resedue if not reflowed properly, leading to weak solder joints. All the fixes I've done were achieved through reflow/resoldering of the suspect ASIC's, on the S17 the hardest part was removing the heatsinks without damaging anything else. I think the S19 uses a different heatsink strategy, so might be easier to rework.I don't think quality control for soldering is their expertise.\n",

      "Dear fellow bitcoin mining enthousiasts,I've recently bought 4 Gekkoscience 2Pac's. I would like to use them together with the Gekkoscience Compac I already had. So for the moment I'm looking for a suitable powered usb hub that ships to Europe and that is compatible with the laptop ( runs Ubuntu server 16.04 LTS) I use for the bitcoin full node. The laptop is a relative old model (about 5-6 years old) and has only USB2.0 ports.I've seen a mining setup on this forum that uses a Sipolar A-300. Is this a good hub? I've read comments about this hub that the amps per port are a bit low. Would this hub allow me to overclock the five miners? An alternative hub I'm considering is the Sipolar A-210 (<link> This hub should deliver 1A per port. Has anyone of you experience with this hub?The Plugable 60W hub that has been suggested looks also interesting, however I doubt whether it will be sufficient to power the 5 overclocked miners 24/7.Or, do you have other suggestions that would allow for overclocking, and are acceptable for my budget (at most 100 euro or about the same in dollars)?

For hubs NOT designed expressly for stick miners it seems that any power rating given is more of a suggestion than reality if you actually want 5v out @ rated power per-port.My guess is that yes, a normal or a 'charging' hub *may* be able to provide rated wattage but it will NOT be with 5vdc coming out but instead the voltage will be lower.

      "So, possibly stupid question, but I'm new to this.I'm currently running a pair of 2PACs at 150MHz with Raspberry Pi controlling them. I can tell ample power is a constant issue. I have one clearly substandard USB hub that is powered, but only has a 2 amp power supply. If I try to run both 2PACs on it, eventually one drops out. I can however run 1 off the Pi unit itself, and one off the hub. But that is less than ideal, especially since I'd like to clock them higher.I have another powered USB hub that is not compatible with Raspberry Pi, but which has a 3 amp power supply. On a scale from \"Go for it\" to \"You're gonna fry you 2PACs\", how bad of an idea is it to just use the 3 amp power supply with the hub that normally uses a 2 amp power supply?Alternately, I did order a Sipolar 10 port HUB, so I could just wait for that to eventually show up from China, but I've caught the bug a bit...\n",

Maybe I got it confused with a different Sipolar 10 port model that did provide 2A per port. No idea.I'm currently running a pair of 2PACs on a Superbpag 7 port hub which is rated at 2A per port. I have them up to 225Mhz which is as much as I dare with my current cooling solution. Going by the spreadsheet on post 1 of the support thread, that should have them pulling something like 1.75A, especially since I have the vcore tuned as close I could without hardware errors. But I suppose it could be a bit above that. The heatsinks are warm enough to be uncomfortable to the touch, but not immediately yank my fingers away.

Pictures: Thoughts: 2 ports are a little too close to each other (possibly allowing for only one miner to run at once). Compac + 2Pac works fine as the heatsinks face opposite directions, but 2Pac + 2Pac does not as the heatsinks are too big. The red LED on the hub itself is a little bad in my opinion as it shines pretty much through the shell of the entire hub, but that may be because I just don't like LEDs at all Design is good and solid plastic, and the included power adapter doesn't have an obnoxiously bright LED, unlike most Chinese power adapters I have owned. The fact that it comes with a power adapter of substantial power is good already. It is capable of powering a 2Pac at a minimum of 300mhz if you find the best position for the voltage to the ASIC.

That said... 1 regulator feeds ports 1 & 2, the 2nd regulator feeds ports 3 & 4, the 3rd feeds ports 5-7.

Looked inside the hub and found ^^ so...Put one 2PAC on port-2, the other on port-4 and the Compac on port-6 so each stick has it's own 5v regulator.

      "Just a thrown together desktop setup to tinker with when I need a break from work really. Actually working on it now, so it's slightly sloppier than normal, but not by much. There are two Ankers here, neither send data, just power. Data cables all go to the Superbpag. The one in the front powers the two fans and I have one of the 2Pacs power-only cable running to charging power at the moment to test running all 7 at 300 (I have one plugged in to the charging only port on the back Anker as well). The Anker in the back has the other six power-only cables attached and is hanging by the cables so that the 2Pacs are slightly angled from tension on the cables - I did have to play around with which connections for which 2pac worked best. RPi3 is connected only to the Superbpag (and HMDI, keyboard, mouse). Pi freezes occasionally with this setup and has to be restarted. I think it's an issue with power (or PSU) going in to the Pi, not the USBs, but I'm not sure as I haven't taken the time to look at that yet.The wire mesh basket it's hanging over is just something I happened to have lying around unused that fit the bill.

      "Hi,Thanks for the info here about hubs for Gekkoscience sticks. I have read through this hub topic and the 2PAC topic as thorough as possible. I'm not an electrical engineer so please excuse me If I write nonsense.I would like to experiment with some stick miners and I have some questions about USB Hubs. The newest one in the bundle is 2PAC (from Bitshopper de). The other ones are older (RedFury style etc.). The plan is to connect them all to 1 USB Power Hub.I'm located in Europe so the options for buying a good USB Hub are limited (unless you want to pay some serious import taxes). I have narrowed it down to 2 products:1. Plugable USB 2.0 7-Port High Speed Charging Hub 60W <link>2. Anker 60W 3 PowerIQ Hub 7-Port USB 3.0 <link> topic already contains plenty of info about the Plugable Hub, thanks for that.The Anker hub specifications:It is a USB3 hub.12V 5A AC Power Supply.Provides power -simultaneously- to max. 3 ports up to 2.1A, and 0.9A for all other ports.The hub will be connected to a custom low-power Mini-ITX Linux Server which I use for various purposes, with an ASRock H110 Skylake motherboard and a Pentium G4500 cpu and 16GB of memory. The box is powered-up 24x7.I plan to connect 2-3 2PAC's (not overclocked) to the USB Hub and fill up the other USB ports on the hub with older sticks and place a 120mm fan alongside the hub.The older sticks are all < 0.9A. The hub (USB3) does not have to work with a Raspberry Pi.I have some specific questions about the Anker hub.Q1: Is someone using this hub, do u recommend it?Q2: Do you think the hub can handle this setup (2-3 2PAC's and 4-5 older sticks)?Q3: Are the specs of this USB3 Hub (2.1A on max 3 ports simultaneously) also valid if you hook up a USB2 device such as the 2PAC?Q4: Are the specs the same if I connect the USB hub to an USB2 connector on the Server motherboard (opposed to a USB3 <truncated> The three 2.1A ports of the Anker 60W are charge-only so they do NOT support data transfer. This means that this Anker hub is not suitable for the stickminers. I will go with the Plugable USB.***UPDATE#2*** The USB Hub Plugable USB2.0 7-Port 60W arrived today and it is working fine.

      "I am using the Plugable 60W USB 2.0 hub and it does work fairly well as long as you know its quirks.Quick guide to follow: Stated before but 3 sticks is the max. I don't care what speed you run them at, stock or over clocked 3 is the max. Must run on ports 1,3,5 or 2,4,6 and a fan can go into slot 7 but it draws from port 5,6,7 combo. I run my fans with a separate supply. Max frequency you can run the sticks at and not have it go zombie or get a USB error is 237.50Mhz and that may be pushing it as each hub may differ slightly (225 Mhz might be more stable for you). If you lose power for any reason you must manually push the power button to turn it back on. Use a small UPS to keep it alive if you plan to run unattended. Set voltage to the lowest setting .69 - .70 across the ASIC voltage and you shouldn't get any hardware errors 237.50Mhz should get you between 72Ghs - 76Ghs Supplied power brick is reliable and only gets warm not hot Over all price point is great I ran 3 sticks at 250Mhz for a while but eventually one stick goes zombie or you get a USB error. Might be 30 minutes might be 6 hours but it happens every time at that frequency. You also have to up the ASIC voltage to .70-.71 to get no hardware errors.If you are good with all of that I would recommend getting them.How to measure the ASIC voltage see here<link>\n",

It's still 7 data ports, just like the black one, but the 8th power port means you can run a Pi and a USB fan off it without taking one of the high-current ports. It's still got the 12V fan header too, don't worry about that.The dummy port and port 1 are also powered by a secondary regulator, which means using them won't take any power from the high-current ports.And don't tell anyone I told you this, but that secondary regulator is actually rated for 3A instead of 2, so if you don't use Port D and are careful about it, you could still run 7 stickminers at full speed.Right now it's still priced same as the black one.\n",

Have NOT tested this.Work with RPI 3 flawlessly thus far running 12+ hoursConsThe supplied PSU is pretty weak, the 7 ports came with a 12v@3A and 10 ports 12v@4A. I am currently running the pictured hub with my Anker 5A PSU pulling 49watts at the wall measure by Kill A Watt.SummaryI like these as they have individual power buttons and worked with the RPI and has uhubctl support. Uhubctl allows you to software cycle a logical hub and port to hard power cycle a zombied stick even though I have not had a chance to test it out since the NewPac has been good enough to not zombied out. Supplied PSU has better efficiency than my Anker PSU even though there are weak and would only be enough to power 3 sticks.As you can see from the photo, my sticks has modified heatsinks (40x40x20mm and 60x60x10mm). The heatsink in horizontal fin position worked out very well, I can hold my finger on any of them permanently with the fan blowing and not get burnt, though the one with slightly less airflow in the front is a bit warmer than the other. The other 3 are lukewarm. The downside to these mods is obviously the GS hub is not really an option for me as I would only be able to use 4 ports at best. That's why I used this hub with a single linear row of USB ports instead.Testing condition is 4x NewPac running at 450Mhz.<link> await more $ available to get the 7A PSU from 419Mining and see how many sticks I can run. I have 5 NewPac, a 2Pac. And yes, the spacing does allow me to fit 6 in there even with the 20mm heatsinks.Caveat found during testing with RPIThere is some sort of flaw in the setup when plugging in too many NewPacs would trigger a kernel panic on Pi Zero W, though there can be multiple causes there from power feedback into the Zero, to too many adapters to get it hooked up. Since running 4 x NewPac with a Pi 3B it has operated 1 day 14 hours plus at of this posting without kernel panic. Previously I was able to get runtime up to 3 days continuously with a connected Pi Zero W and 2x NewPac, but when plugging in 4x NewPac the Zero W kernel went crazy after a few minutes to 15 minutes max. The crashes are observed with multiple known good Zero using multiple known good 32GB Samsung EVO Select cards. The problem appeared more with the Zero than the hub, though I do not have further time nor equipment to test conclusively and have given up using Zeros as controllers.\n",

      "When it comes to Bitcoin mining, the choice of equipment can be crucial for profitability. ASIC miners, in particular, have risen to prominence in the Bitcoin mining industry due to their superior power efficiency and hashing capabilities compared to other types of mining hardware. In 2023, various ASIC miners compete for attention in the market. However, the selection process can be complicated, considering energy costs, miner prices, and efficiency ratings.In this blog post, we are going to analyze four major Bitcoin ASIC miners available on the market:Bitmain Antminer S19 XP 141 TH/sBitcoin Miner S19J Pro 122TWhatsminer M50 120THBitmain Antminer S19 90 TH/sBitmain Antminer S19 XP 141 TH/sThe Bitmain Antminer S19 XP is a cutting-edge miner with a hash rate of 141 TH/s. Its high hash rate makes it a power horse for Bitcoin mining, suitable for miners looking to generate a significant return, power usage is 3000watts. However, it also means that efficient machines will be most expensive per th/s, hence more considerable operational expenses in terms of energy costs. This could protentional increase your ROI time.The key to assessing its value is to weigh the initial acquisition cost against its efficiency (watt per TH/s) and your local electricity rates. If you have access to cheaper electricity, this miner high cost could increase your (ROI time).Bitcoin Miner S19J Pro 122TThe Bitcoin Miner S19J Pro 122T is another powerful ASIC miner from the Bitmain line. Despite its slightly lower hash rate of 122 TH/s compared to the S19 XP, it shines with its energy efficiency. This balance of power and efficiency can provide a better ROI for miners with higher electricity costs.Whatsminer M50 120THWhatsminer has been known for producing reliable and efficient ASIC miners, and the M50 is no exception. With a hash rate of 120TH/s, it offers a similar performance level to the S19J Pro. However, its exact efficiency will depend on specific power usage, which might vary. Its a solid choice for both cheap and moderately priced electricity scenarios.Bitmain Antminer S19 90 TH/sThe Bitmain Antminer S19 90 TH/s, while offering the lowest hash rate among these miners, stands out for its cost-effectiveness. Its a reasonable choice for those with lower electricity costs or beginners who are just starting their mining journey. However, its lower performance might require a longer timeframe to reach a positive ROI compared to the higher-end models. If your electric price is close to ZERO , this might be the machine of your choice as it has the cheapest price per th/s and could protentional be the fastest <truncated> the right Bitcoin ASIC miner depends largely on your specific circumstances, particularly your electricity cost. If your electricity price is low, you could opt for a miner with the best price per TH/s, like the Bitmain Antminer S19 90ths, for the fastest ROI.If your electricity is expensive, a more efficient miner balancing watt per TH/s and price per TH/s, like the Bitcoin Miner S19J Pro 122T or s19 XP, might be the better option. Nonetheless, careful consideration of each miners capabilities, cost, and efficiency will help optimize your Bitcoin mining endeavor in 2023 and beyond.Keep in mind this post is done on 14.07.2023 , crypto market changes very quickly and by the time you see this miner prices and profitability can change which could potentially affect your ROI.full postWEBSITE | INSTAGRAM | TELEGRAM | TWITTER | YOUTUBE\n",

All asic miners have one to run the mining software (aka \"control\" board), they are ARM based, but i assume sooner or later they will switch to RISC-V like you did. China is particularly strongly interested in moving out from arm into risc-v.So technically you just need to plug the Compac F to one of those SoC solutions via USB and port/compile cgminer to the appropriate architecture or replace it with your own mining software.I'm curious about the availability of BM1397 at this point, shouldn't you aim for later chips now?\n",

All the while still being a very decent miner for ~6 ASICsCgminer is really setup to run on a desktop OS (like Linux, macOS or Windows), and will not easily port to bare metal or an RTOS on the ESP32.IMO BM1397 is still in the sweet spot of price, performance and efficiency (for people who aren't Bitmain).

I know you said you don't know, for you to get answers you need to find the answer to that question first, i might be interested in buying a few if it was $50, maybe buy 1-2 if it was $100, ditch the idea altogether if it was $200, so ya, sadly, it all boils down to the price.\n",

Cooling will not be hard as the asic is the sole component on the side of the pcb it is mounted on, so different size heatsinks will work. But a plug and play version would be possible too.I guess the esp's are more than fast enough to handle several asics. I will do some profiling so see what the actual number is.I think sadly the BM1397 is the last asic suitable for these kind of miners. If you do the math you will find that newer asics need 20A or even 40A to run, and those kind of currents are not easily managed on 2-layer pcb's (or even 4-layers, just look at the current shunts plastered all over antminer hash boards).Well, the pool needs to send new work every 30s/60s, whether you are mining with 1MH/s or 100PH/s..The few bytes that get send back from the miner are irrelevant (also I've limited the max. tickets in my software to 3 per minute, but if you compile from source you could remove that limit).Just think what 1000 of these miners will do for damage, or 10000?I'm thinking of also creating a simple proxy (also on an ESP) so the pool would only have to supply work to one connection instead of having to waste resources on multiple miners on the same IP address.Regarding the price; the estimate is nothing more than an estimate, but much more precise than a guess But I have no idea about margins.

Other possible commands are;- r for reboot- format to format the internal storage (factory reset)- type <filename> to show contents of file- dir- c to calibrate the core voltage (this is needed as the actual core voltage will drop when you increase the load by increasing the asic's frequency due to droop in the charger, charger cable and pcb traces)- f+ & f- to increase or decrease the asic frequency in 5MHz steps- v+ & v- to increase or decrease the core voltage in 5mV steps- s to save the current asic settings to /asic.cfg so it will reuse these settings after a rebootNever heard of anything you mentioned here..Its too early for resellers, first comes the manufacturing, and I've sniffed enough leaded solder and flux in my life to even attempt doing it myself Bitaxe is cool, I wish Skott all the best. He started his project roughly at the same time as I did, but I only discovered it 6 month ago (I was too busy developing things to search github, although I did search github before I started working on it).

Some sort of block generation will be unavoidable sooner or later unless they do something with the serial interface to make it fast enough (a normal T17 needs a ~1.5Mbaud connection between the asics, so a S19j @120GHs would need roughly 3 times that speed without block generation).\n",

      "I'm developing a series of standalone miners built around BM1387 & BM1397 asics and an ESP32-C3. I've been working on these for over 1 year now and I think I've got enough knowledge now to make a version that can be mass produced, the question I have now: is anyone interested in such a miner?The configuration I'm thinking of has the following properties:- Standalone, only a usb charger with 5V/3A needed and a wireless connection.- Single BM1397 asic.- Hash rate of 200GHs upto 250GHs (and more probably).- Power consumption out of the wall 8-15W (depending on efficiency of the charger and hash rate).- My own miner software (open source, in beta stage, fully working but lousy UI) based on Arduino libraries that allows manual on the fly voltage and frequency settings.- totally not worth running on a non-solo pool, but a cheap lottery ticket where you enter the drawing for free every 10 minutes for as long as you live(*)..I've designed my hardware around parts that are for sale on aliexpress, but for mass production I will have to redesign parts of it using components for sale at mouser.com , and I will need to find a company willing to produce them (a problem as the asics are not sold by any big electronics reseller), and also sell them. Currently I'm thinking of seeedstudio.com, but I haven't contacted them yet to see if they are both willing and capable (sourcing the bm1397's and soldering them on the backside of the pcb).There is also a open source version with bm1387 asics (that I could also redesign to use mouser parts) that you can built yourself (advanced electronic soldering capabilities/tools required).I have 6 prototypes running, live stats <link> 3 bm1387 versions (2 with 2 asics, one with 4 asics), and three single bm1397 versions (workernames containing 'test').I started out designing the miners for personal use and therefor used parts from aliexpress but I'm so satisfied with them (they will run as long as the internet connection is up, and will reconnect in 99.9% of the cases when it is not, the 0.01% is caused by a quirk in the esp software) that *I think* others might be interested in them also.But it will require another hardware redesign which is not needed for my personal use miners.So, should I invest the time (and money) in this for you? Or is this a niche product? I have no idea what the retail price will be in the end, but the pcb hardware and assembly should not be much more than $50, add to that a margin the the sales & production, an included cooling solution (say $5 for the heatsink and another $2 for a fan, $x for 2 small 3D printed clips to mount everything) and that should be it.Comment in this topic if interested, or if you think this is stupid, you won't hurt my feelings as I have already got what I set out to achieve.(*) I'm not sure if any (solo) pool will support low hash rate miners in the future. Pool operators have to pay for their hardware and connection, and a low hash rate miner costs them as much as a complete mining farm. Maybe CK can answer that.ps: new forum user with (unknown to me) restrictions, my old user name got lost in 2016)edit:I've redesigned the miner to use standard parts, but sadly i'll have to make another one as one of the buck converters from mouser.com is apparently a fake Anyway, I did some stress testing to see what it can handle and got this <link>\n",

I could then put said exhaust in the ceiling tile (It is a drop ceiling in a warehouse) and vent the heat into the ceiling. Would that work? Does that trap the heat in the ceiling and not affect the rest of the room? It does have sheets of thick insulation in the ceiling. If that would work it would be perfect. I was initially going to vent it outside as there is a part of the room that has a wood wall that I could put an exhaust in but those types of exhaust are generally like 700cfm which would seemingly be too powerful.

Though I am not into mining yet, I am always getting engaged in the conversation like this. Recently I also posted about the cooling effect of the immersed hardware in BitCool coolant. This makes the venting issue go away since you are taking care of the heat with the help of Coolant that is circulating through the hardware chamber and taking away the heat on continuous basis. However, in your case since it is just single unit with no complex farm, I think a simple vent will do it's job rightly. Moreover you can also position a normal fan on one side that will point out to miner in such way that it will push the air towards Vent and rest will be taken care by the exhaust. If operations start to go above mid scale then you can think about the BitCool Coolant tanks.\n",

In the process they degraded the quality with the cheaper aluminum treatment, or from their point of view, \"optimized their process\" since the fact people were running the miners more efficiently meant that they were leaving \"too much\" margin for \"improvement\" (could be made <truncated> in typical Bitmain fashion, the \"newer\" models are using the lower yield chips. The \"good stuff\" left with the 104T and 100T Js, the \"non Js\" rated for 90/86/82 are simply the lower yield leftovers. Again, typical Bitmain fashion. Too bad some people don't see it and get lured by the \"cheap price\".I agree with philipma1957 predictions. Unless they use the recently announced 2nm node by TSMC, but even if that's in the plan, its probably still a year or two away, so like they did with the S19, may actually start with a 5nm part not terribly more efficient than the XP, just like the original S19 Pro 110T.Desiwe has a more interesting approach, but its just bruteforcing higher efficiency by running parts slower and better cooled (8nm Samsung). But if they manage to upgrade those chips with an even lower node, then Bitmain will have something else to worry. Who else uses Samsung? Ah yes, MicroBT...\n",

These are not meant for the cooling purpose but for avoiding the entry of bacteria's, solid particles and other type of contaminant into clean rooms in the pharma industries. I know this because I am trying to understand the mechanics behind different ways of cooling the mining rigs. In case you have dirty water and bad filtration system around the area then you can option out for the air curtain and certainly do some \"experiments\" with it. An Air Curtain is either horizontal or vertical and is fitted to entrance/door. What a miner can do is project the vertical air curtains in such a way that they will throw out the hot air out of the mining box area. The conventional fans are not proper fit because they are big, circular and their sizes limit the \"surface area\" they can cover. Have you ever experimented on this or do you think it can be good strategy for the up rising miners? May be bigger farms too.\n",

Frankly that has wide array of application in the pharma industries and they do use it for keeping the two sections insanely cold. One you have ability to drive the air in various angles. The design is so thin that it fit to any type of miner box you have. It is like region separator so it's not like conventional fans and can get the work done quickly. You are using high number of filters. This must be adding up lot of cost in your overall project. A) I mean the filter cost must be divided in the two stages viz., 1) Filtering unit - one time cost 2) Filters of 5 micron, 1 micro and 10 micron to be replaced now and then since they are not the permanent one. They have to have the wear and tear over the period of time. Is the water that bad in your region?

      "The problem here would be your power range, so you will need to disable 2 boards and keep only one, with those S19s removing two hashboards leave you at slightly below 900w, with whatsminers set on low you can get a single board down to 800w range.Of course this makes the cost per th a lot higher, and on average you are going to get 30-35th out of those new gen miners, so anywhere between 1.7$ to 2$ a day.You can check my miners sale topic for price refferences to see if the project is worth it, also water blocks cost between 100-200$ for the new gen miners like M30s and S19s.The downside of your project is the limit of power, if you could do up to 2000w it would make a lot more sense.\n",

      "Yes, I'm aware of that. The S19's are just the first \"somewhat suitable\" devices I found, but as you say, they are above the power range I think would be reasonable. I can run the numbers again and maybe I could go with 2000W (or disable some boards as you say), but I was wondering if there are perhaps other devices that are lower-powered out of the box.However, as stated in the OP, the first priority is using available electricity to produce heat (not the mining itself), so in any case, I would only run the miners intermittently. And if I run them with 2000W, it means that the water I need heated is done sooner, so it would run for shorter periods of time. The total energy usage and thus the total hash produced over some time frame would be fixed anyway; so it might not be worth it anyway.I will need to look closely at the costs of course. But disabling some of the boards sounds like at least one first potential option to consider, thanks!\n",

      "First: I have no experience mining. But I know a thing or two about energy, and that's where I'd start. Do the math: how often do you have excess electricity available? What do you do with it now: do you get paid to sell it to the grid, or do you have negative prices when that happens? How much water do you want to heat up, starting from which temperature and going how hot? How many hours per day does this happen?My gut feeling tells me it's not going to be worth it, but it's always fun to see the numbers. The next question would be how hot the water coming out of a miner could be, followed by how much hot water you use in a day.Some made up numbers to get an idea: if you have 1 kW excess electricity for 8 hours on a day in summer, that's 8 kWh. That produces 28.8 MJ of heat. Let's assume you manage to capture 80% of that heat in your water, that's 23 MJ, enough to increase the temperature of 100 liter water by 55oC.Assuming you'll only use this around summer, and can't use it when you're on vacation, you'll be able to use this maybe 110 days of the year. That's 880 hours mining, or 10% of the year. Taking mikeywith's numbers, that's $70 per year in mining revenue. A year later, when the difficulty is much higher, your revenue will be much lower unless you upgrade your miner.\n",

I think what we need to clear up first is how is your electricity system setup-up, do you have batteries or are you grid-tied or other, if you don't have storage capacity for the extra electricity then there is an avalanche of problems including the gear not working at all during one cloudy day because your already strained system can't generate enough extra power.The other thing as heaters were mentioned, those were heaters that run on the grid, you have here a boiler that runs when you have extra energy, so for the comfort it's a big no. I understand the hobby part but it's going to be a pain in the ass to make it actually usable, and if at any moment you're bringing the $ in the discussion it's already a futile attempt, with 150-200 you can get a water boiler, it draws around 2-3 kwh a day to keep the water warm if you don't use so you don't need to power up a gear again to reheat it (if you can ) and you don't need to release water if you reach boiling point either.In $ it will never be worth it, if it's a hobby and he's doing it only for fun, yes it might be!\n",

      "These are very good points of course. I did my own maths, based on about 500W for 6 hours a day, which is power I should have pretty much \"always\", even in winter. That would be enough to heat all the water we need. But yes, of course, it would mean that the miners do not run all the time, which is of course a thing to factor in. That's why I was also thinking about running especially cheap, less efficient old miners - because in essence it would still be better and more fun than just burning the electricity anyways to heat water. Some people (including \"experts\") I talked to suggested not getting a thermal solar installation anymore, but just PV and simply doing that instead for hot water.It is also a good point though that of course it won't be worth it if it just generates $10 a year or whatever. So that is indeed something to consider, especially as difficulty goes up and rewards are halved. I will have to carefully look at the hardware suggested here (S9 and S19 with some boards disabled) to see what makes sense for me.The alternatives would probably be getting a heat pump to more efficiently use the electricity (but then, the heat pump itself is a lot more expensive than a S19 with watercooling setup), or just keep using the oven (burning wooden pellets in my case) and selling the electricity back to the grid.The discussion is quite interesting though, and I think it shows that the individual details matter very much - and that might be why miners for heating have not yet been a thing used more widely.\n",

Call it a case of once bitten twice shy. We've run many of these S19j Pro+ units in the mine through this summer, including some with substantial overclocking of upto 135T. The soldered heatsinks seems to be doing a much better job of heat dissipation and S19j Pro+ miners consistently ran about 5-10 deg C cooler than other S19 series miner in the mine. No, hashboard issues this summer either. While this is with just a few months of testing, I'd say its safe to assume that whatever issues Bitmain had with soldered heatsinks on S17 have now been fixed with S19j Pro+.

      "Hey Skot! I came up with a similar idea at the start of the year and had PCBs manufactured, but only recently got around to putting them together.Compared to your design, it's a complete breakout board that provides access to all pins in 0.1\" format, as I thought better having too many broken out pins than too few.Anyhow; you beat me to uploading the whole thing and testing it out. Good job; I read that it's already working quite well, so far. However I'm wondering what you use to supply the 0.8V at probably around 10A that those 2 chips should be pulling. My next step would have been to design a buck converter circuit. Do you just use a lab bench power supply?I'm definitely interested in collaborating to maybe make this into a compact USB miner with integrated FTDI chip and buck converter (I have a lot of unused slots in my GekkoScience USB hub.. ).Otherwise, I can see a pod miner with more than 2 chips being interesting, too, maybe targeting 95W so a standard quiet CPU heatsink could be used.Disclaimer: I'm a big fan of sidehack's work / GekkoScience and don't think such an open source project is going to compete with them. For one, their flagship Compac F is much more efficient and much faster, and also it's a ready-to-go product. These are PCB files that users have to get produced themselves and get to work soldering them, too.\n",

I just thought for early tests like figuring out the pinout and which passive components to connect where, even a piece of copper clamped to it should suffice.I did consider adding holes for a northbridge heatsink like you, though!Regarding the pitch; I actually found a BM1387 footprint / component in <link> and crossed my fingers that it's correct (it is). You mean a lab bench power supply or a random prebuilt buck converter? And just to clarify: you do have 1.8V regulators on-board, too, right? As for the main step-down regulator, I actually envisioned building my own synchronous buck converter using a buck controller and two MOSFETS, just like GekkoScience.As you noticed, GekkoScience / sidehack, uses a <link> which is a buck controller. It just controls two MOSFETS in a synchronous buck converter configuration, like this. The MOSFETS are in place of the switches and the controller is not shown here; it controls the timing to achieve the right output voltage.I don't think that integrated (single chip) buck converters exist with the types of power we need to push and the efficiency required. For instance, a linear regulator going from 5V, 3A to 0.5V, 30A would go up in smoke immediately. That sounds like a cool idea, hadn't thought of that! Making a more standalone, pod-format device sounds great to me. I'd just personally focus more on the power supply first and getting my breakout running; feel free to work on the ESP stuff - then we can merge everything. Well I meant standard in the sense of 'Intel LGA 1151' or 'AMD AM4' - if we replicate their hole spacing and copper area, it would be possible to just take a box-standard thing like this:<link> can easily cool 100W, only downside is pretty small copper area. So the ASICs will need to be very close and amount of chips per cooler would be space-limited.\n",

A reel contains usually 1000 or 10000 for very tiny pieces , 100 or 1000 for medium but still slightly small pieces.Once you add test TPS40305 power delivery to the board PCB, schematic, Gerber files, i will order the next prototype batch of 5 so that we can test it quickly. if you DM me i can send you a few pieces of that batch for testing.\n",

      "Um for god's sake yes!!!I think I had posted a few links about feeding the chips earlier in the thread... How power is fed to an ASIC, FPGA, CPU, or any other high-power high-speed switching deviceis a critical design point that is easily overlooked. In short the PDN (Power Delivery Network) is NOT just a simple DC bus - it must be treated as a RF stripline due to the sub-microsecond high current spikes that happen with every clock cycle...edit: It was in your thread in the Development & Technical area:A good place to start for resources is TI.<link> goodies:A good paper on it available through ResearchGateFrom the EDN archives: <link>and very good presentation about it with a very simple test circuit <link> In that article figures 3 & 4 along with accompanying text clearly shows the problem and that's using a 5v device. ASICs with their <1v Vcore, well...Results from search of the EDN archives re: PDN's All are highly recommended reading.\n",

      "date: 2022-10-19 03:50:22\n",
      "I'd be surprised if it does not pass as a Class-B device.The main point about the RF design aspects of feeding these chips is not so much about cutting down EMI as it is about making sure that the Vcore at the IC pads stays within very tight limits as the clock cycles the gazillions of logic gates in the chip on/off all at the same time.Remember, unlike a CPU or GPU chip whose various circuits are 'doing their own thing' which includes waiting for data to be passed to/from other areas, in a mining ASIC all of the logic gates in the chip operate in lock-step with every clock cycle. 1 cycle to load data into logic array (cores) from coms buffer (and present result from previous data to coms buffer), 1 cycle to push data through array, rinse & repeat with several thousand logic cores running at several hundred MHz. As a result, the PDN needs to be 'tuned' so to speak to smooth out the resulting current spikes and corresponding voltage dips. That said, since a mining ASIC has very predictable operations going on with no buffering or wait-states involved (aside from in the coms) on vs a CPU/GPU it is much simpler/easier to address the issue.As pointed out in that 'simple circuit' article, even with the bypass cap located very close to the chip there is still a sizeable difference in ripple voltage seen at the cap vs at the chip's power pads. That test circuit gave them 89mv ripple at the cap but 1V ripple at the chip located just a few mm away from the cap. Even for a 5v device that is pushing things - 1v is 20% of 5v. Apply that potential 20% ripple to a circuit running at <1v will definitely cause problems because the switching thresholds are far tighter.Edit: When I started in this Forum in early 2014 I did a fair bit of forensics on the CoinCraft miner from the Swiss company Bitmine.ch (now out of business) that used the A1 chip which Innosilicon designed for them, more precisely their \"Made in USA\" miner that they 'partnered' with AMT to make & sell here in the USA. Exact-same miner, just with parts sourced, PCB's (using Bitmine's gerber files & BOM's) made by and the miners assembled by the US company IMET. A very large part of their problem was due to absolutely clueless design of the PDN on their hash boards. 2nd issue was Bitmine having absolutely no idea about the proper thermal design that the chips required, 3rd was IMET's lack of experience in dealing with high power chips & the needed *very* thick power planes & thermal vias to move heat leading to innumerable issues...Even Inno repeatedly pointed out the errors but the Powers-That-Be ignored their advice with disastrous consequences. OTOH, the company that did the famous DragonMiner (not to be confused with the far later DragonMint) that used the exact same A1 ASIC knew how to do things right and produced 1 damn fine miner.A good start about the Bitmine.ch/AMT kerfuffle starts here and here I'll try to dig up more of those threads that in summary are Poster Child example of how to totally screw a miner design.Last edit: I guess to summarize this, ja, you *can* use a separate Vcore PSU along with heavy bus cable to feed the hash board like the large miners do with bus bars but remember they are pushing much much higher voltages through long strings of chips. Pushing just a few hundred mv at up to 20A through the cables is not so forgiving. That said, just as the large miners do, the most important bit is to properly address the quality of power presented to each chip and not just to what is fed to the power input planes of the board.\n",

      "Nope.8 years ago when I 1st got into mining and joined here I might have but not these days. Going on 67 years old, just don't have the energy to do side projects anymore. After getting home from work (R&D Engineer at LaserMech) it's just eat dinner, go online for a couple hours and then bed time...That said, those links to EDN articles about PDN design considerations pretty much cover everything giving valuable pointers about what to keep in mind when laying out the power traces to the chip(s), how to calculate the inductance of said traces, and calculate good ball-park values for the bypass caps (located as close as possible to the chips power pads) to minimize the Vcore bounce.If anything, just take care with the layout and have a variety of bypass caps with different values you can tack onto the board and experiment with to produce the lowest amount of ripple seen at the chip power pads. Again it must be emphasized to not only place the 'scope probe on the Vcore pad but also attach the 'scope return lead to the chip power return pad. Um, I should add that the 'scope MUST have an ungrounded probe return! These days most do along with the multi-trace 'scopes having each channel return isolated from each other as well as from chassis ground. Connecting the return anywhere else introduces artifacts caused by the high frequency currents flowing through the power planes.It's not difficult to get right or even 'good enough', it's just that it's too easy for folks to not give the matter a 2nd thought and just use a good ol' 0.1mfd cap stuck nearby the chip, leave it at that, then wonder why the circuit is glitchy. As a bonus it would be a good lab experiment for you to see the effects of looking at the voltages not only at the chip but also at various random points on the power planes. Tip: Use the 'scope set to AC input mode, it will let you turn up the gain to have a good view of the ripple voltages. Most newcomers to the high-speed power circuit design world are astonished at how different things look when probing at various locations on a solid power plane - as I've said elsewhere, this is not a simple DC bus feeding a static load or even one using devices with (in comparison) slow switching times. It acts like a DC-biased RF power circuit.Edit: For a good in-depth look into the 'joys' of miner design, I highly recommend the Bitmine CoinCraft A1 28nm chip distribution / DIY support thread thread. It is about doing the exact same thing you are doing - a community -designed, open source miner - but using the A1 chip. That thread also drifts into a couple other community-miner design projects that were going on in the early days. That thread was of immense help when I did the forensics for AMT on the (Bitmine.ch) miner they were trying to produce. In short it covered everything that killed the Swiss design so I had a good idea what to look at. The lead designer in the thread even let Bitmine know what to do and the company ignored them. Oops...Last edit: About the bypass caps. Note the plural. Best practice is to use several different value caps in parallel to get the final total capacitance needed. Usually 2 is fine with a small one 1/10th the size of a big one. 3 caps is even better. That allows each cap to target different parts of the wide range of harmonics the spike produce.\n",

      "yes, exactly! I don't think you guys are going to get Linux running on a ESP32. Not well at least. When I was talking about running cgminer on a ESP32, what I meant was: Porting some of the functionality of cgminer to the ESP32.The things that cgminer Kano edition can do that need to run on the ESP32 (as ESP-Miner) are:- Turning on and configuring the BM1397 over serial - Setting the baud rate, hashing frequency, and filling in some other mystery registers- Connecting to a pool or stratum server and getting the latest work over the stratum JSON-RPC protocol. - we need a place to configure this URL too.. maybe on a simple webpage hosted on the ESP32?- Parsing that work into the format that the BM1397 wants - it's really pretty similar. the only tricky thing is the midstates, but Kano seems to have figured this out.- Sending the work to the BM1397 over serial. 115200 baud is prolly fine.- Listening for replies from the BM1397 (decent hashes) - based on the hashing frequency, know when the BM1397 has been at it for too long and send it some new work.- Packaging up those replies into the format that the stratum server wants and sending it off.- All of the administrative stuff of running a miner like; - Set the BM1397 core voltage and current. - check the fan speed - check the BM1397 temperature - optimize the hashing frequency and core voltage for max efficiencyI put this together with a (hastily made) block diagram on GitHub; <link> I have not coded any of this yet. I tried out some of the ESP-IDF WiFi sample projects and they worked great. I messed around with cJSON and it seems very capable of parsing JSON-RPC. <link>\n",

I am very exited by your project, for a good reason, I started a similair one back in november 2013, here of course (but my thread has been deleted since then, just my account profile can attest the period). Let me present it for reference only (nothing is to keep from it, old time, old chips, old tools, old design...) : Nebula Miner.The concept was to promote a decentralized mining (Satoshi spirit) without taking into account ROI and other profitability stuff. Nebula Miner was a small miner you could buy for less than 50$ (idealy), plug it at home, consume less than 10W electricity and let it run knowing you are participating to the global BTC mining (network securing) effort.Back in the time, the ASIC industry just started, Nebula Miner was based on Avalon 1 chip and Bitmain was not a thing yet. I was living in China and add access to many electronics parts and suppliers. I was working as freelance designing various PCB and embedded SW for them.Nebula Miner had a modular design with a Main Board for ethernet (wifi) communication with pool, and 1 or up to 8 Hash Board with 1 ASIC chip on each can be plug in a chain as show on the photo : <link> I stopped the project because it was almost impossible to buy ASIC chip on the brand new market (without repair spare parts as of today), and alone against the big mining company like Bitmain....But today, looking at your current project, I am thinking about joining force to revive my old dream. I have advanced skills in PCB design and embedded SW development.\n",

They aren't too worried about ROI, and they aren't going to run any of the big noisy industrial miners out there.I've never heard of \"Satoshi spirit\" before, but I think I like the idea. Satoshi open sourced this whole Bitcoin thing and look where we are now. The least we can do is open source projects that are building on Bitcoin.The electronics field has come a long way since 2013! Now we've got amazing, open source firmware SDKs, IDEs, compilers and CAD tools. PCBs and PCBA are dirt cheap now and amazing quality. WiFi SoCs are commonplace and relatively cheap.

(if not use, better not creating a signal out of the package to give ambiguity...)- where the 5V is generated ? I see +3V3 (U11), 1V8 (U5) and 0V8 (U6) being generated from 5V, and BM1397 VDD (alias of TPS40305 VOUT) being generated from VIN_M (the monitored VIN), but nowhere the 5V beoing generated...- on the ESP, I think you inverted TX/RX, please double check it- can you add pin header and TP for debug purpose on the 3V3 RX/TX/RST, (additionnaly to J3), and add also I2C SDA/SCL signal on this debug pin header ?- can you use an optional (with a serial 0R resistor) signal from a CLK_OUT of the ESP (pin 13/14/34/33/32 up to you) going to the BM1397 CLKI instead of the U1 one. I may want to try later if MCU can generate this clock by SW so we have control on the hashrate of the BM1397...- on the BM1397 you pulled down BI (with R4) are you sure it will not being used ? on BM1385 datasheet it is noted as a Busy Input (internal schmit trugger and pull down). Maybe you can link it to a GPIO of the MCU, we will see later if needed. (and add the 3V3 signal to the debug pin header too).- for the voltage level translators (U2/U3/U4), I used to use TSX0104 in my previous design, it is easy to use because bidirectionnal. Did you consider them ?- for EMC2101, the ALTER#/TACH pin can be configured as input (TACH monitor to mesure Fan RPM) or output (ALERT# signal to trigger an IRQ on MCU when special temp/tach conditons are met). I see more value having an ALERT# signal from it to the MCU to trigger an interrupt for Temperature Critical exceeded (with hysteresis to deassert the signal). The FAN RPM is not very usefull for us. Also EMC2101 porpose a Look-up Table of 8 stages so we can control by hardware FAN speed accoding to BM1397 internal temperature. Maybe what you can do, is link the EMC2101 ALERT#/TACH pin to a MCU GPIO, and the FAN TACH to another MCU GPIO (be careful of voltage level here), and SW will be able to configure EMC2101 in TACH reading for some seconds, by propagating the FAN signal, then switch back to ALERT interrupt for a longer period (1h ?). So most of the time we use Interrupt monitor, and only once in a while do a fAN RPM measurement for UI needs...- it would be usedfull to have the BM1397 VDD on a ESP ADC input to measure the BM voltage- it would be usefull to have the TPS40305 PGOOD linked to a ESP GPIO to know if Power is Good\n",

      "Wow, thank you for this excellent review! this helps a lot. I've added my thoughts inline below.The DS4432 is a dual channel part. We only need one channel. I didn't see a cheaper/better stocked current DAC alternative. The DS4432 datasheet doesn't have much to say about unused outputs. my guess is that you leave the unused channel floating and make sure not to enable it in software. (They default to off on startup)The input to the bitaxeMax is 5V. that happens at J1 and J2. There isn't any protection happening yet. Maybe that's a good idea? Any suggestions on how you would do that? I created a github issue for this. <link> oops! nice catch.sureThe BM1397 has a decent PLL hashrate clock that is configurable through a couple registers. I think this is the traditional way to change the hashrate (with the corresponding core voltage change). But I agree it would be interesting to play around with this.. I'll add it.I'm pretty sure it's not needed, at least on a single ASIC chain. But if we switch to the TSX0104 level shifter, there is a spare channel, so I can hook this up. I initially avoided it because I remember it being kinda slow. But now that I'm looking at the datasheet I see that's for open-drain mode (like for I2C). In push-pull mode it's 24Mbps, which should be fine for us. I see it's in stock too -- I'll switch to it. thanks for the reccomendationI feel like knowing the fan RPM is important, at the very least for feedback -- is the fan going the speed we set? And for doing a sanity check on the fan -- is it connected and working? I see what you are saying about the ALERT function though.

      "When comparing 'pod miners', right now there are 2 options; Futurebit Apollo and R909.The Futurebit Apollo with 2-3TH/s costs around 700 bucks incl. VAT, while the R606 from GekkoScience (R909 predecessor) cost only 400 (incl. VAT). But the 909 will also 'only' put out 1.5-2TH/s. So 400-ish would give you a similar hash/ value, although at much higher efficiency. Roughly 100W instead of ~200W+ (should be much quieter, too, because of this). So therefore it might be sold for a bit more than the R606.I'm wondering what number of chips it has; should be just 4-6 chips, probably on the higher side, though, as they need some pretty fine tuning to achieve 500GH/s on Compac F sticks.I'm also excited to see these changes to cgminer by kano. We will have to look into individual chip tuning as well, once the single-chip device works and we try out the first multi-chip boards.\n",

      "Great, did another check :- for the CLKI signal directly on the ESP, please add a 0R (or a 33R as it is a clock) serial resistor to disconnect this signal by HW.- on J3, maybe better to put 1V8 on this debug connector because all signals are on 1,8V level (and now the 3V3 is available on J6)- maybe better using the 4th TSX0104 line for the CLKI signal instead of BI, and put BI on the voltage divider ? BI is low freq signal. Waht do you think about this ? I have the feeling high freq signal are better ont the TSX0104 (otherwise we should better use voltage divider for all signal from ESP to BM).- on the Fan design, I understad you plan to use a 5V FAN directly powered by our input VIN, * Firstly, Fan usually generate lot of noise, we should consider filtering this noise. * Secondly, we will control this fan with a 3V3 level PWM, and the 5V TACH signal is directly on the EMC2101 pin. Maybe better using a TSX0102 for level converting 3V3/5V these 2 signals. * Finnaly, as for this dual signal we are not sure yet of the final usage, I would do a more modular (optioal) HW design using 0R resistors. For exemple: a/ 1 signal from the FAN TACH_3V3 (from J4 after going through TSX0102) connected to a dedicated ESP GPIO (with the 0R resistor so we can unconnect it) b/ 1 signal from the FAN TACH_3V3 (from J4 after going through TSX0102) connected to the EMC2101 ALERT#/TACH pin (with another 0R resistor so we can unconnect it) c/ 1 signal from the EMC2101 ALERT#/TACH pin connected to a dedicated ESP GPIO (diffeent from a/) (also with a 0R resistor so we can unconnect it) this way we can choose by HW (some 0R resistor) the logic we want to try during the development phase.\n",

      "just one set of level shifters for the whole chain.The BM1397 has the ability to cascade the data from one chip to the next. ie you can connect the \"CO\" or \"Command Output\" pin of one chip to the \"CI\" or \"Command Input\" of the next. This works for all of the data pins and the clock. The BM1397 even has 2 different modes so you can change the function of the pins to make routing easier. With this in mind we don't need to level shift between BM1397s. Just when they interface with the ESP32 (which is 3.3V only)On the Antminers they power several BM1397s in series so they don't have to deal with the low voltages as much. I'm not so sure this is the best way to go for a relatively low chip count miner. You run into problems with the exposed copper top of the BM1397 then being at different voltages (and a heatsink shorting them out). It also makes it more difficult to change the core voltage of individual chips.In true Bitmain fashion there is almost no documentation. Just what we can figure out from the various repair guides and poking around Antminer PCBs. I've slowly been trying to gather up everything I've found and figured out here; <link>\n",

The obvious reason is that it eliminated the need for multiple Vcore regulators giving higher efficiency but that came at the price of needing more level shifters and not being able to fine-tune the voltage for each chip in a string - the chip needing the highest Vcore is what sets the voltage for the entire string.So ja, for just a few chips, either run them all in parallel from 1 regulator or use multiple regulators with 1 per pair of chips as done in Bitmains' S1-S4 miners.\n",

Using 9 chips in parallel for each block (domain) in the string that means each block is pulling between 90 to 112.5a which fits well with the s17 PSU can put out per-board. Even using 10w power @1.2v it's still 8.333A/chip or 75A per block of 9.Those currents explain why there is extensive use of bus bars soldered on top of the power planes in miners like the s17.

The Prisma, using the same heatsink profile, took in unregulated 12V into a series string. I believe Bitfury was already capable of series but I don't know much about early generation BF gear, since it was expensive (boasting 2W/GH at a time when most gear was 6+W/GH).

Then code a (Rust) driver for BM13xx (based on Rust Embedded-Hal abstraction).To update on my progress doing so, I received the broken T17 I brought on ebay (2 hashboard seems to be functional enough to be communicating) with stock FW, so I was able to log serial/i2c communication between ControlBoard and HashBoard using Saleae Logic2 (logic analyzer) and code a High Level Analyzer to parse the Serial Protocol (communication with BM13xx), it is available on <link> Basic communication protocol is covered, I am into understanting the registers and their fields now. For this I do cross comparaison with S9k log (BM1393) with stock FW I also have on hand. I will also try different custom FW for the T17 (including BraiinsOS+) to learn how these differents flavor handle the same HW. I would be also very interested to have more log from other miner (S17...). So a lot of work need to be done in this direction...For the ESP32-S3 selection, it is the most ESP32 capable chip, that's why I guess Skot selected it. Its exotic architecture (Xtensa) make it less compatible with existing project. Nevertheless, esp-rs, which is the Rust support for ESP32 family seems to have active community and good result. Basically, there is 2 flavors : - one based on IDF (the framework supplied by Espressif, based on FreeRTOS, so a low level OS in C, that can handle all wifi/network layers) where Rust application can be run on top (so kind of a mixed C/Rust embedded). To my personal point of view, considering this approach, it is better to have a full IDF FW with existing cgminer C cross compiled to it, no need for Rust here, this is the \"standard C FW\" I was refering to earlier.- one based on plain Rust, but no wifi/network is available yet.IMHO wifi is not reliable enought for 24/7 mining device, copper wire (Ethernet) is much more prefered here. That's why I have close look also into W5500 SPI/Ethernet bridge from Wiznet (I used them a lot in many other project), that has a very good support in Rust Embedded enviroment (<link> the Rust embedded framework, there is mainly 2 solutions :- RTIC : Real Time Interrupt-driven Concurrency which I am not yet fully documented. Community seems very active. Alex (from w5500-rs) has a project example with it (<link> Embassy : EMBedded ASYnc, which I start to love more and more. It has great support for STM32 and RP2040 (RPi PICO chip) but no ESP32 yet. w5500-embassy is not finish eyt, but Alex gave me access to its private repo where job is ongoing there. I will try to make progress on it. I tink a great HW for this, is the W5500-EVB-PICO, basically a RP2040 with a W5500 on a stick (brought 2 of them). RP2040 is a dual core Cortex-M0+ at 133MHz. Having a dual core look promising to have one core for the Network <truncated> and the second one for the BM13xx serial handling. Embassy seems to be able to deal with these 2 differents contexts (not tried yet).Finally, why I think Rust is way to go for a embedded miner, it is mainly because Stratum V2 Reference Implementation is done in Rust (<link> I recently joined their weekly dev meeting and they seems to be interesting into a first embedded implementation. It can be done on the ESP32-S3 on top of IDF without the need to have actual BM13xx I think.And about others Bitaxe's chip driver, I have well debugged my EMC2101 rust driver, but it is not finished yet.\n",

      "first off, I am honored, impressed and excited that you are putting so much time into this! Thank you! I am slowly working on the C (esp-idf/FreeRTOS) based FW. Once I get this bitaxeMax_v2 board design wrapped up and ordered, I'll dig into it some more.yes, exactly. Even the C version of the firmware isn't really a port. cgminer relies on too many OS APIs to really be ported to embedded. Nonetheless, cgminer is a great example of the main concepts in miner software and ck, sidehack and kano have done a great job with this. Thanks guys!this is awesome. Anything we can do to better understand the BM1397 is great. I started a GitHub repo to dump everything I am learning about the BM1397 here <link> Sidehack and Kano are obviously way ahead on this. The new cgminer is a treasure trove of BM1397 learning; <link> was lured into the ESP32 world because of their RISC-V core in the ESP32-C3 and the fact that it's available (you can't say that for many 32bit MCUs these days). For those who don't know, RISC-V is a relatively new ISA (processor core) that is free and open -- a welcome change from the fiercely closed incumbents like ARM and x86. The RISC-V core ESP32 isn't quite ready for this project yet, so the ESP32-S3 with the Xtensa core will work nicely until it is.I feel like WiFi itself should be reliable enough for mining. Is the ESP32 WiFi implementation the problem? Maybe the antenna isn't good enough? I'd really like to have these miners be wireless. I dream of attaching one to a solar panel and putting it out in my yard to mine whenever the sun's out.Embassy does look cool. It's frustrating though that it's only really available for STM32 and nRF -- both MCUs that are extremely affected by the chip shortage. It looks like the RP2040 is somewhat available?Great! I'm pretty close on the bitaxeMax v2 design, hopefully we can get you some HW soon!\n",

      "I've never tried a hot plate, so I can't help you there.I have soldered approximately 1 billion PCBs with the following method;- Get a convection toaster oven. Nothing fancy, it just has a fan inside for more even heating. This is like a $50 Black and Decker kind of thing. Never use this oven for food.- Get a thermocouple thermometer. These are $30ish- Use Sn63/Pb37 no-clean, leaded, solder paste. I usually get MG Chemicals brand, in a syringe. Keep it in the refrigerator so it's nice and cold before you stencil it. (obvs don't get it near your food). Wash your hands well after.- Take your time to get the paste stenciled right. Don't be afraid to wipe it off with IPA and try again. The paste stencils better when it's cold.- Use tweezers to put all of the parts on the pasted board.- Put the board(s) in the toaster oven. I usually put them right on the wire rack, which is in the metal tray.- Put the thermocouple inside the toaster oven. Close the door on the thermocouple wire so that it holds the end right above the PCB, inside the oven.- Turn the oven on bake, medium setting.- Once the temp gets to 140C, turn down the oven heat and try and keep it at 140-150C for 2 minutes. Open the door a little if it's getting to hot. This is the \"Soak\" phase- After two minutes, turn the heat to high- Once the temp reaches 200C start a timer for 30 seconds. Keep the temp between 200 and 220C for this phase. Usually you don't need to do anything. This is the \"Reflow\" phase. You should see all of the paste melt.- After 30 seconds, turn off the toaster oven. open the door.- Let the boards cool for a bit in the oven with the door open.- Once cool to touch, inspect the boards with a microscope for dry pads and/or bridges. Depending on how well you did with stenciling there may be a few, especially on QFP packages. QFNs sometimes too. Fix these up with paste flux, solder braid and your soldering iron.Stenciling is the hardest part. reflowing in a toaster oven works surprisingly well, IMHO.\n",

      "Hey @Skot, @NebulaMiner and everyone else reading; I tried solo-mining on my Compac F today and it works really well. Due to Testnet difficulty dropping to 1 after 20 min without blocks (which happens frequently), you should be able to mine at least a dozen blocks per day if your ASIC, driver and host software all work as intended (pretty much regardless of hashrate).This should be a relatively easy and quick benchmark to verify if our BM1397 open-source project works (i.e. produces valid blocks) or not.I guess @Skot who already has a running Bitaxe should be able to try it with his cgminer based board (with no ESP on it); but it will be more interesting / necessary to verify the ESP32 firmware once it's ready.

My understanding is that the BM1397 does not send any response unless it finds a hash below the target. That means it is the job of the mining software to know when the chip has exhausted the 2^32 bit nonce space. It's unclear what the BM1397 does after hashing the entire nonce space, but I don't think it's productive. Using a ESP32 timer and the configured hashing frequency, we should be able to know when the chip is ready for new work.I think it makes sense to have a separate RTOS thread/task listening to, parsing and acting on BM1397 responses.

My idea which im not sure if it will work is to basically have 6 domains where there are 6 sets of two chips in series. the power will come from 12 volt of the apw3 and get stepped down to 5v then 3.3v which then powers the 2 asic domain splitting the power into 2 coming to that 1.6 vdd line it needs.

I know on the s17+ you can get it to around 370gh per chip. yes bitdeer is the offshoot of bitmain. we dont do any manufacturing only cloud hosting, this is just a personal project. the heatsink issue is confounding me and I really am just tempted to use thermal pads but I know how hot these things run and just dont think that will cut it unless youre at like 100mhz, thermal paste would work but you run the risk of not putting enough on and it making contact same with thermal adhesive. The way the 17+ is laid out it has seperate heatsinks per asic but thats also in a machine with a 6000 rpm fan which im looking for this to sit on the corner in the floor and you basically forget about it, maybe get lucky with a block, or just hope pricing goes back up and by then even the little bit youve mined would be worth something. its really frustrating that you either can only do a hobby project with just a few chips or you have to go for it and basically just clone a hashboard. cause I can now see that my design wouldnt really work anyway because if its drawing that much power per two chips in series then me having 6 sets would make it impossible to feed, which refers back to at that point you basically just have to clone a board just with less chips.\n",

      "Quote with image tags.It would honestly be great if you could export those EasyEDA files to KiCAD and then push that KiCAD project to GitHub & continue developing it on KiCAD. I switched myself, too, following Skot's advice and it's not only been easy to switch, but this software is also sooo much better. World of difference.Nowadays most power goes to 12V. For instance, this 1600W premium unit from Seasonic only delivers 82.5W of those 1600 on the 3.3V rail.<link> specced PSU's still deliver 20A, but that's pretty wasteful. You're looking at using 66W out of a 650W unit.You were faster! I am right now running 6 BM1397 in the R909 that Skot linked to you earlier, producing 2.133Th/s at around 100W. So you need 2 chips at 350GH/s each and those will pull about 30W together. Giving them more juice just makes them run too hot and getting less efficient.Thermal paste would still give you contact in some areas. It is just meant to fill tiny imperfections in the metal of heatsink & chip, not to create an electrically insulating layer between them.Maybe look into graphite thermal pads. They have very high thermal conductivity (like paste) and I believe low electrical conductivity.You could buy yourself an R909 and open it up (I won't do it with mine); I see 2 beefy heatsinks, one per side of the PCB. It has 6 chips. No idea how sidehack did it.\n",

One thing I think could be possible is to have them in one domain. S17+ miners have 13 domains of 5 chips making 65 chips. in those domains the gnd only becomes an issue on the 1397 if it is crossing domains. only issue is now I have to figure out how to make 3 domains of 4 chips lol. I wanted to design this for the 1398 as thats what I have the most access to and runs on .36 volts just a lot of current but after learning that kanoi only goes up to a 1397 kinda hampers that and I dont want to design something then wait for compatability\n",

These developers evolved in these emerging open source Bitcoin mining hardware projects are truly spectacular. They are selfless and have the original vision of Bitcoin open source close to the chest. Nothing to scam when everything is FREE. We will however watch closely. What is really awesome is they are actually trying to make it even easier for people to get with PCB manufactures and order these prototype boards themselves tutorials. A hug daunting task for the average person is to actually order these prototype boards. A goal is to make tutorials for anyone with zero hardware knowledge to order these boards and slap on an ASIC chip. Done and Done. Many people who have zero hardware development skill. Can actually gain first time hardware knowledge by the love of mining Bitcoin and through the knowledge provided by these open source hardware projects. Really fun concept of people learning Bitcoin through building their own miner.At the same time Mining hardware companies will still thrive. People will always want boxed, plug and play miners.

      "Hey guys, super excited to finally be entering the Bitcoin market. As most of you know the team and I have been building and refining our home mining system/platform over the years, and our number one request has been when we will release a Bitcoin product. I believe the Apollo has finally matured enough where our production capabilities and hardware has reached a point where it makes sense to release our Bitcoin version.The FutureBit Apollo BTC has been in development for over a year now, and our focus from the beginning was to create a unified platform where anyone can run any aspect of the Bitcoin system in one easy to use, quiet, lower power device, and I think we have achieved that. Our platform essentially combines the 300-800 dollar node market, with a controller that is more capable, and a mining hashboard on top for \"free.\"This aspect is critical to why I founded Futurebit and its mission. Almost no new users to the Bitcoin space run nodes or mine, and both are important in maintaining Bitcoin's independence and decentralized nature. We wanted to create a device that combined both these features in a seamless zero-config way, and offered utility beyond just sitting there looking pretty running a node or mining. The powerful SBC with our custom designed NVMe drive bay can host a Full Bitcoin node and run almost any Bitcoin Application we can throw at it. We hope more Bitcoin devs join our Platform in the future and provide even more utility to the device.On the mining side we wanted to build a low cost hashboard and cram as much hash power within the thermal and noise limits that make sense for a home setting. Those limits were 1) not exceed power that would have any significant impact on anyones electric bill (sub 200 watt), and 2) Run quiet in anyones home/apt. In ECO mode (~125 watts 2TH/S) our custom designed fan runs under 2k RPM and is almost inaudible. In Turbo mode (~200 watts 3TH/s) its no louder than a typical desktop system.These design choices were made so we can start to tell Bitcoin users interested in the future of the ecosystem that there are solutions where everyone can be mining, and not worry about what the ROI or power costs are, and only care that the are accumulating Bitcoin in a cost effective way over the long term and securing the network.I really hope we get to the future where the network is secured by 10's of millions of individual devices like mine and others, instead of the of the couple hundred centralized mines that secure > 50% of Bitcoin's hashrate today. Im not going to post all the details of the device here as almost everything is covered in the below two links:<link> starts this Friday at 6PM EST at the above link. Well be handling all NA orders there directly. Happy to also announce that Bitshopper.de will be participating in the Pre-Order, and will be handling all UK/Euro orders directly.Also might have an Australia/NZ distributor up for pre-order but not sure yet.For Rest of World we have really good Fedex rates and can almost ship anywhere. Obviously check with your local laws for import costs/fees etc.Shipping will start at the end of April into May barring and major delays. Design is complete and we have running prototypes, and all major components including ASICs are on order. We have learned a bunch from our past launches and have built thousands of units so we dont anticipate any major setbacks. As always this is a pre-order so expect delays regardless.Ill keep this thread up as the main community discussion/question thread for the time being, and open a support thread when we have our OS and support docs finalized in the coming weeks.Even if this is not the device for you hope all you guys at least appreciate what we are trying to do and spread the word out to people that might be interested, especially newer users that would never consider mining or running a full node!Thanks for all your support over the years...its been a wild ride and hope it gets even crazier in the future\n",

Controller has USB 3 so fast SSD external storage can be used as well.From what he has told me brexit caused a special deal with EU that makes it easier to ship to UK than even before.

      "Nope - still don't see the reason why a toy miner requires a pre-order of months.It's old mining chips with poor Hash/Joule.I'd just wish sidehack would make something with recent mining chips.All the major manufacturers are ignoring home mining, expecting 3kW and more per miner, so we end up with poor performance old hardware for home miners.125 watts 2TH/s is 62.5W/TH ... = over 810W for 13TH/s ... if you wanna compare it to VERY OLD hardware.(and that's assuming they're not doing the typical over hype stats also)The node option is pretty poor also.Firstly, there's no way you'd ever run your own solo mining with it, that would just be a major block loss waiting to happen for most people.So to run a node yourself, you want an at least an i3 with at least 8GB ram and 1TB HDD, stick Ubuntu on it and add Bitcoin core.A current full node needs over 360GB of disk space just for bitcoin.500GB isn't expecting it to last for very long.NVMe is faster than HDD, but makes no difference for the bitcoin network at all.Space matters.Bottom line is it says $600 for old mining technology and a poor spec node that will need upgrading in the not too distant future.Edit: and with the upcoming taproot changes - using core bitcoin just means getting the next version from them(see the link at the top of the page)... especially if there's any bug fixes for taproot before/after it goes live.\n",

      "You clearly dont get what im trying to do with this product. And its a bit disappointing coming from someone like you that has been in the space as long as you have. The product is not for people on this forum, its for new people coming into Bitcoin now that would never run a node and would never mine in the first place.No one needs an a top end system to run a node, nor the latest ASICs to mine. The point is that we are getting more people involved in doing what they are supposed to be doing to decentralize the network. Sure could I have gone with the latest asics? Yes, but it would have cost 3x more and then I would have the latest and greatest that prices out the people this is designed for.HDD vs NVMe is not about network, its about sync time. We put a lot of time and effort to bring sync times from typical SBC hardware from a week + to under 48 hours with our system. Thats a huge leap and is comparable to the hardware you quoted for a fraction of the cost. Drive is also upgradable, we are not going to charge extra for a 1TB drive when people will be able to upgrade in 2 years to a 2 TB drive for the same price.You should be happy with every node that comes on the network, and every miner that is not part of a centralized mine.What outcome do you prefer? A Bitcoin network run by millions of devices like this \"shitty\" hardware as you describe it, or the current trajectory we are on where a few hundred people control a large % of the hashrate, and most of the nodes are run by centralized exchanges?Funny thing is im working with a few pools to see who Im going to go with to solve the payout issue for small miners, and you were on my list to contact. Guess the 100PH worth of shitty miners I could bring to your pool and 10x your hashrate is not worth it then huh?\n",

      "Assuming that payout issue is the same I found when searching for possible pools for the Apollo BTC before concluding not to participate in the pre-order, it really shouldn't be underestimated from new users point of view. I haven't been following BTC pools at all so it's likely I may have missed some (and I assumed KanoPool wasn't anymore even active due to the stats page not having anything recent), but the conclusion was that with one unit running at about 2.8 TH/s (based on the screenshot), the payout interval would end up being around 2-3 months with the current difficulty and the minimum payout threshold that pools are having. From a new user point of view, that's too long and the user will start to doubt things like settings being correct or the pool not being the right one. Especially when in comparison a single Apollo LTC unit still gives a payout interval of 2-4 days (litecoinpool with minimum payout threshold being my datapoint).\n",

Not bad.C'mon sidehack - where's these new miners you mentioned Deciding to use an NVMe instead of an HDD takes little time and effort.If your base system design is slow and needs NVMe to make it reasonable - go from a \"week +\" to \"48 hrs -\" - then use a better base system.The initial block download also depends HIGHLY on your internet, not just the computer, downloading that 360GB of data (see below)Nope, yaw only happy with yaw one since it means $ in yaw pocket for what you will sell.Most people are going to be asking why it uses so much network when they first get it, why it takes so long to download bitcoin (as you say \"48 hrs -\" but also certainly a lot longer if they don't have 100Mbit internet - 10MBit network will use 100% for over 4 days) and why most people are running at a loss mining with it when it's finally up and running.Getting the ignorant to use something that isn't well suited for them is bad publicity for Bitcoin.At least make sure you include this link: <link> wont be millions of these devices.There will be thousands of unhappy people who shy away from Bitcoin because of them.Sorry, I can't be bought Anyway, I very much doubt you'll be anywhere near 100PH selling 2TH miners.My pool fees are so low so that when people do mine there, although they've already been done in by whoever supplied them the mining hardware, that doesn't continue with their mining fees on the pool, and a 0.0001 payout limit\n",

Can you clarify if this is really the case or is bitcoind and a mining software (cgminer?) the only thing preloaded?If you guys are preloading more stuff then it would be really cool if you hosted a repo where all these bitcoin-related programs can be auto-updated.

If you are talking about full nodes, they are running stock variant of bitcoin core with no flag set.Expensive? Please point to a plug and play full node setup you can buy and a 3TH miner that can be run in your home that is under 600. Most node hardware companies are in the 300-800 range, even a DYI setup will cost you ~200 in components You should also check out eBay, our USB miners are selling second hand for 100+ and Apollos 600+ more than twice what I sold them for. You just trashed quite a big heap of cash (if you're not already trolling and probably already sold them for way more profit than i ever made on them).Wifi was always an alpha feature on our original Apollo, and never hid that fact. The wifi controller was buggy and the chip maker never released a fix for it. Like you know there were simple fixes if you really wanted to get it to work. Either way that won't be an issue with the modern wifi controller on the Apollo BTC.If you knew anything about how hard production is for low volume electronic devices like this (especially being made in the USA) you would know that 1) im barely making any profit off these 2) a pre-order is there to find out how many people are serious about ordering one 3) production takes time and component orders have to be placed ahead of time...im not ordering 100s of thousands worth of components to have a large % of orders cancel during ship time.Even the chinese companies that have 10s of millions in their coffers do pre-orders for lead times twice as long as mine.

Second, the chance to run a quiet system that mines like this one is somewhat unusual. I think the quiet mining and good hardware is what explains the success of the R606's as well. At current Bitcoin prices, it is tough to say this would ever make a profit but most of us believe strongly in BTC and have for years. This and other small miners (like the R606's) retroactively become profitable as BTC goes up. I personally expect BTC to be 100K or more by August which would make this profitable.

      "respect, Stefan.at first the price (475 for pod on bitshopper) looked a bit high for the hashrate compared to for example a second hand Avalon841.But this is silent unlike the Avalon which needs to be put in a garden cabine and probably uses 1300+W for 12TH.Yours at 3.5TH/200W would need almost half of the Watt for the same TH speed.Ok, it will be expensive at nearly 1900 for 4 units but it's still silent It's also a bit higher priced (75) than the Terminus R606 (which I also have and runs around 880GH without issues for months now) but it's (written to be) 2-2.5x as fast at nearly the same draw (100 vs 125W) and 4 times faster at twice the Watt draw (100 vs 200W) in Turbo mode.which means this product isn't as bad as someone claimed on the first pages and as stated from the beginning ideal for home useand can be placed on your desk without noticing that it's on (if the sound level is about as low as the Terminus R606).I got notified by Bitshopper's mailing list about this but it was already sold out when I peeked at it.\n",

      "Well, I think your expectation might have been a little off. The problem isn't the Elon Musk tweet, it's really that people don't understand the situation in China. The Chinese clamp down on crypto currencies has nothing to do with the volatility, but everything to do with control. Crypto currencies remove the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) from the equation of transactions, reducing their ability to control the population. The CCP wants the ability to monitor all transactions by its people so that it can manipulate and control them easier. IMHO, we, as the crypto community, need to ensure this is understood by the rest of the world, so that arbitrary rules by the CCP don't affect the value of the currencies. I apologize if this has been answered, but after reading through four pages about the \"ownership\" of cgminer and the profitability of a single Apollo, I couldn't read through the rest of the posts: Will cgminer run the Apollo?

      "Received my full package and 3 standard units last night. Ordered the non-PSU packages to save about $300. Hooked up with dual parallel miner PSUs (750w server PSUs, 2 Apollo units per). One of them had a small screw loose on the bottom that was rattling inside the package and one of them the front LED doesnt seem to be working, the other 3 blink red to show that theyre bashing, one of them doesnt. But up and running, kinda. Slow to start, one of them the hashboard kept on dropping on and off. Was about to open a ticket with support but since it was getting late, decided to just sleep on it and deal with it in the morning. All seems ok now, getting around 10.5 TH on balanced mode @ 638 watts. Ill let it run for a few days before I try ECO mode and Turbo mode. Never went into this thinking this would be a quick ROI, but its a fun little toy, great to support a US company, and have my kids learn about crypto as well. What would be great is if you could have different pools per unit. Wouldnt mind having all 4 units pointed at variations of SHA-256 coins like one at BCH, one at DGB, etc. I know it wouldve been possible with 4 full package units operating independently of each other, but a full package with additional standard units, it wouldve been fun.\n",

We were on track before memorial day, but then the holiday hit, and we had to stop the line to correct some issues from the first deliveries so lost about a week there. Either way the original expectations were 4 weeks to complete full Batch 1 shipment, we are only one week behind schedule on that (not counting the 2-3 weeks production start delay). I know everyone is eager to get their product, but you guys have to appreciate the fact that we paid about 20% extra in whole product costs (which is a large chunk of our margins), to procure overpriced parts, to ship everything air from suppliers, and ship everything 2 day to you guys. We could have kept everything as is, with another month delay, but things like that matter to me regardless of whether we are sold out with a long wait list. What we do almost no one does for a reason, its hard as shit and almost no one can do it profitably. Companies funded with 10's of millions have failed where we have succeeded, but we are still just a small company pushing boundaries and we have a lot more delays, growing pains, and learning until we get to where we want to go.

Will it be OK to hook one PSU up to both systems provided that the PSU can support the four PCIe power connections that when combined, the Apollo nodes will need?

      "if you're new, you can think of a node being like a mix between an app and a copy of the blockchain. the \"app\" portion of the node is used to send transactions on the bitcoin blockchain. when you send transactions with a hardware wallet, an exchange or a mobile wallet you are using someone else's node. you are pretty much relying on their copy of the block chain. the node on the futurebit downloads the blockchain directly from bitcoin core so that you can use your local copy of the blockchain to send transactions yourself. that way you don't need to trust someone like coinbase, cashapp or ledger to broadcast a transaction.the node also has a function where it monitors the rules of the network, and you also provide copies of what you downloaded to other people who also want to download the blockchain. its kinda similar to seeding a movie or mp3 on kazaa or napster, that's why they call it peer to peer cash the advantage is that you have a truly \"all in one\" device.with something like this, you can generate a small amount of income and no one can censor your transaction. places like coinbase, ledger, cashapp, etc can get regulated so you don't want to rely on their copy of the blockchain. it's also significantly more private to broadcast your own transactions. when you use someone elses node, they know all of your transaction history or something like that.\n",

I'm not a big investor, I have excretionary funds available once in a while, but being told that I can't order a unit because I may have ordered one from the last batch is completely and arbitrarily stupid.If I want to buy one I will. If I can afford to buy one I will. Not everyone can and I understand that but -- and here's the big problem-- WHEN YOU ANNOUNCE THE NEW UNIT ON THE FORUM ITS THE FORUM MEMBERS THAT ARE GOING TO ORDER IT. All of us are big supporters and will continue to be so and as a result will continue to buy what you put out. Stop telling us that we can't order again because we've purchased in the past. What are you trying to do? Limiting orders is limiting your profit and production. If there is such a huge call for what you make then perhaps its time to consider raising the price to make them a premium. As it is your products are being sold after the fact on e-Bay for four times what they originally sold for. Doesn't that tell you something? Stop thinking small time and get going on what you are good at. We will continue to support you, that's not a question its a fact. You are the seemingly only bright light in this chaos of shit products and shady companies. Do more and get better suppliers as you go, its a no brainer from my end but then....... what the fuck do I know.

That's why it seems he puts those restrictions in place, and I think it would be counterproductive to the maxime of decentralizing mining again if the price was 4x what it is now.It's already going to be hard to amortize the cost at 900 bucks per machine, so a higher price and removal of purchasing limits would not help in the decentralization.\n",

I once spent 90 BTC on a bag of honey roasted almonds. (guessing our escrow interaction happened prior to the trust system so I went ahead and left you some positive feedback for this transaction)As a promised update on my personal experience with these miners... I did move them from nicehash where they were only getting 900 sats a day to slush where they now appear to be showing the full 6th/s hashrate (I'm running them in turbo mode) and are getting approximately 1450 sats each. This is with over 100% luck on slush so while they are still a little below expectations, they are now mining at a profit of around $0.05/day each which I think is actually acceptable for home miners given the exchange rate situation currently. So by switching from nicehash to slush, I went from unhappy with my purchase to satisfied, but I would be downright happy if I managed to get them up to 2k sats each. I'll give them some more time and try playing with them a bit more during my free time to see what I can accomplish. Any tips are always welcome. My temps are showing as 0 / 33 / 67.

Out of the box it executes many different commands that you might not want in your device, so double check everything before running it.

      "FYI the stock psu is more than adequate to properly run in turbo mode. I asked earlier in this thread if you want the answer from the source. The only real reason I see to use a higher output PSU is to go beyond the turbo mode to maximize hash rate. I ran 4 units like this for about a day or two and while the units did perform flawlessly at their peak performance, the small room I had them in got ridiculously hot and obviously the fans were much louder. The amount of heat they generated made me very uncomfortable and you void your warranty doing this.\n",

      "I ended up getting a 750W PSU which doesn't even run a fan until 300W, so my PSU is now completely silent. Game changer for silent mining with this device.To tune the parameters first decide what you're after, for example the noise level of the fans you want to tolerate, or a specific hash rate you want to achieve. I've managed to get up to about 4TH/s for a few minutes but the noise of the fan and the heat produced was absurd. Personally I think this device is perfect for efficient silent mining at home instead of trying to get a massive hash rate with loud noise and heat.The fans will stabilize at their running speed in a few seconds, or couple of minutes of running. The hash rate will oscillate a bit more, so you might want to wait a bit longer to see the actual hash rate. Running it overnight should give you a nice stable hashrate reading.Here are the relevant options and their ranges:I would start first with the board power(brd_ocp) and set it to a level with acceptable fan noise. Once that's done, note the current hashrate. Then experiment with different board frequencies(osc) and see how it performs.As a reference, here are the values of the presets:For an absolutely silent mining operation (fan running at 1k RPM or so, basically inaudible compared to the quiet 2k RPM or so of ECO) set brd_ocp and osc to 30. You'll get about 1.3TH/s with no noise. If you want to go higher and keep the noise down, you can add more external fans running at very low RPMs. I'm in the process of designing this solution.Here's the \"official\" tuning guide from the Apollo binaries <truncated> file):\n",

      "I agree with external fans. My Apollo sits on 4 feet that I cut from some rubber and one fan has been slid underneath and one laid on top. I hardwired both these DC fans to a USB cable that is plugged in into one of the Full Package's USB ports, so they run at roughly half speed (5V of their 12V max rating) and it hashes 3TH/s pretty silently at 200W. It is not inaudible, but it was a very easy quick setup with no software modifications. It's all stock on 'Balanced' mode and the fan adapts itself downwards after adding quiet external fans.\n",

If one of them is underperforming, for example half of hashes is incorrect, you are losing half of one core out of 44 cores, effectively 1/88th of the hashrate. And your miner will be 1.1% slower than other perfect miner. But dashboard will show scary 50% HW error rate!

      "Hello everyoneI noticed the relativ low price for S19 hydro (non pro, XP).I realy like the possibility of \"remote colling\".One S19 would replace my 3 very old miners and double the hashrate.But how reliable are those units?\n",

      "The S19 Hydro is more efficient than the air-cooled miner and has higher power consumption. The Hydro system must regularly monitor the cooling tanks and look for any leaks or leaks to prevent any potential technical failures. Additionally, it is crucial to place mining hardware near appropriate water sources and in well-ventilated areas. This will ensure optimal heat dissipation, efficient cooling, and a positive mining experience.ZEUS MINING is selling this miner.\n",

      "I think OP is talking about the non-XP hydro 130-150th range, and he is correct, they are pretty cheap, I have them for 8.5$/th, roughly 0.3$ cheaper than the regular air-cooled S19, and 5$ cheaper than the pro, hydro cooling is not as simple as running air-cooler miner, the cooling efficiency is a lot better but it comes at an expensive cost to set up the right infrastructure, it seems like people are more interested in getting air-cooled miner and submerge them in liquid cooling or, stick to what they already know (air cooling).I think hydro cooling is better suited for larger operations where you have one huge setup that connects a dozen of them, and it becomes worth it, for smaller operations, I am not sure if it's worth it, to this point, I have not sold any hydro units.\n",

Have a 2mm copper plate to put on the chip side of the TEC to spread the heat too.Dont think ill bother with a back side cooler as the TEC will pump enough cooling to the chips anyway. this is going to be totally impractical and go against the reason of having a 2pac (silent, power efficient mining), but its gonna be fun lol.\n",

I've never pushed one past 300MHz (hence why the chart cuts off there; it's my data). VH can tell you where the code stops supporting speeds, but it's probably upward of 500MHz (technically possible maybe with liquid immersion). That's a decent setup you have there, pretty sweet repurposed cooler.If you ever feel like upgrading to NewPacs, they'll mount up exactly the same as the 2Pacs (screws in the same place and everything), but NewPacs overclock like a breeze. You can typically push them to three times the stock hashrate without adjusting voltage. Your setup could see upwards of 300GH, especially with ASICBoost enabled.I don't know how feasible it'd be for you, but GekkoScience also makes a USB hub good for 3A per port.

      "cgminer is connecting to your pool. That's good.Your USB hub is one of the better ones... That's good.If everything was working well for you, it should be no difficulty for you to push to 200MHz or more (with sufficient cooling). Not finding any chips `might' be a dead miner, BUT... Before you consider returning the 2Pac (to the vendor you purchased from) I would try this... You are running it at 25MHz. That is extremely low for your equipment... maybe change it to 100MHz to see if you can `wake it up'. I've seen many times where these 2Pacs don't operate well if they are under-powered... 25MHz may not be asking for enough power to fuel your miner - so give 100MHz a try... if you have a USB or 12V fan to keep things cool, you won't hurt the 2Pac - even at 200MHz.Also, look back to the first few pages of this topic. It may be that the potentiometer needs to be adjusted back to its stock position. Also, try starting cgminer without your 2Pac plugged in. Sometimes hot-plugging a miner once cgminer is already running will be enough to get the miner started...You have many things yet to try before declaring your 2Pac dead...Good luck... And I hope one of these suggestions will help you.\n",

Sometimes, cgminer can detect the 2pac in error after repeatedly unplugging and plugging it in. On other occasions, removing the stick and plugging it back in allows that particular stick to be detected by cgminer, but then another stick is detected as \"0 chips found.\" Does anyone know what could be going on?I'd like to try and run a single instance of cgminer for each stick and see how they do on their own. However, I'm not sure how to enter in the \"--usb :1\" command on a windows pc.

      "Is that the guy in the yellow case with a tiny built-in fan and BM1384 chips?If so, I can't really recommend using it. They basically stole my 2Pac design and botched it into a fire hazard. The main regulator circuit is technically adjustable but there's no safe range on it which means you can overvolt the chips to like 2V quite easily. This is especially troublesome because they put diodes across the node-level capacitors to help balance on startup so if you give it more than ~1.4V those diodes start to conduct and then start to smoke. I think the chips are counterfeit (at least on the ones I looked at, the logos were lasered off) and not very well adhered to the heatsink. Both the ones I looked at had USB configs copied from one of my 2Pacs, including the same serial number on both sticks (all of my devices have unique serials).But hey they got a nifty little built-in fan, so there's that.\n",

So 175 gets 175, but 170 would get either 168.75 or 175; I forget if it rounds down or up.As for hashrate, each stick should level out to MHz*0.11 which means 175 should see 19.25GH per stick and \"170\" would see about 18.6GH74.5GH across four sticks averages out to effectively 169.3MHz per stick so if you were shooting for 170 it looks like you got it.When you first plug in a stick, the exact hashrate is meaningless because it's estimating off the timing of the shares returned, which appear randomly.

It seemed that once per day, sometimes more, sometimes less, one of the 2pacs would zombie out. Frustrating, but <truncated> worked wonders.Not long ago, I decided to fiddle with the frequencies (compac to 200, 2pacs to 150 MHz.)

      "Came across this old discussion by accident and thought it best to clear it up ... mainly to clear up the original post misunderstanding here:<link> what the cgminer code does is indeed the first half of the first hash of the double sha256 hash.The reason is, when you modify the nonce in the data being hashed, it doesn't affect the first half of the first sha256 hash of the 2 hashes required.So you only need to do that first midstate hash once per 4294967296 double hashes done in the hardware.i.e. The CPU generates the midstate (the first half of the first hash) and the hardware then does 4294967296 hashes on the midstate and the 2nd hash, for each nonce value.Now pretty much any CPU can do at least a few MH/s so using the full CPU power of a slow CPU could generate millions of mid states per second.But the miner doesn't even need millions of them per second for the work it requires, the worst design I've seen of that was with the Bitmain S5 that required 4096 midstates before it would start hashing - so about 1ms of CPU work on a slow CPU to get the midstates ready on a block change.Any other new work that shows up, isn't as critical as the block change work, but even for the block change work, generating the midstates is more than fast enough and moving this to dedicated hardware will have negligible hashing performance gain.Aside: Canaan miners do generate the midstate in their hardware if you are concerned about it\n",

      "Hi everyone,I am a total newb to ASIC mining, I have some experience in the Linux OS and some (light) experience as a coder and hardware tech. So I think I can follow what is going on in the thread, but I know I have a lot to learn still. I managed to build the VH version of cgminer on a Raspberry Pi 4 running Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS 64 bit using the same steps I quote below.I am running 2 x 2Pacs on a powered USB hub at 200mhz. It's working great with an avg hash rate of 92Gh/sI would like to re-run this experiment on a Ras.Pi 3b running Pi OS Lite 64 bit. I did find some libs changed in the Ubuntu release so I kept those changes on the Pi OS. So, I followed the same steps I did on the Ubuntu setup after the OS install but I am getting errors on the compile. I am sure others have done this, but I don't know if the more recent OS releases have changed anything. The config (I included below) added support for icarus, bitmain and gekko. I was running one pi to manage them all, but after reading this thread and playing with overclocking, I pull the antminer ASIC and S9 out of the mix. So I tried again with just '--enable-gekko' in config and got similar results. (See next post for the output).Below is what I did, adapted from what I read here and in other threads.I can post the full build output if that helps, but it seems where 'make' starts to crap out is in the 'newpac_miner' folder part of the build:-- EDIT: See my NEXT message for most recent 'make' output ---Any help or suggestions are welcome.

Here's my setup:- 1 GekkoScience Compact F- 1 7-pot USB hub from bitcoinmerch.com with individual switches and blue LEDs per USB port- Ubuntu 22.04 laptop- cgminer (I tried novak and kanoi versions from github)I plugged my mouse to the USB hub. It works. Blue LED lights up.I plugged my keyboard to the USB hub. It works. Blue LED lights up.I plugged the Compac F device to the USB hub. No Blue LED light. No Red LED light either on the Compac F.I see messages in dmesg when I plug and unplug the mouse and the keyboard.There are no messsages added to dmesg when I plug and unplug Compac F. I made sure the power switch is on. I used hardinfo app in ubuntu to check the list of USB devices. It shows the same behavior as dmesg.I've tried running cgminer (both novak and kanoi versions). Both say no device detected.Is this an indication that I received a defective Compac F device?Please help. Thanks!\n",

      "Hi Folks !! This is my first post here. I hope this is the right place to post this. I got a Gekkoscience Newpac to do lottery mining for fun. I read in the manuals on the web that you can adjust the vcore from 550mV to max 880mV. Are these correct ? But when i check my voltage i have only 480mV on both chips and i cant set it any higer with the potentiometer. I use a normal powered USB Hub nothing special. Anybody knows the correct stock vcore settings ?\n",

Think of their comments as a lesson in learning to always dig deeper on your own before asking in a public Forum Do a search using asic miner speed as the search term to see what I mean... The top results are current best available.That all said, yeah that particular scam (dual coins at the same time with incredible speed/power 'specs') comes up at least 2-3x a year and is probably ran by the same people...One does have to ask where you came across that site? I do hope it wasn't from Coindesk or similar BTC 'news' site which are mostly pay-to-publish sites. Several years ago Coindesk ran a 'new product announcement' and 'reviews' on said miners for company running the exact same scam and got raked over the coals for it. Hopefully they have learned to at least use a *little* due-diligence on that sort of 'news'...\n",

      "Hi All,In real life I manage construction at a manufacturing facility. For an office I occupy a 24 foot by 8 foot enclosed trailer. It is stored outside in the North East US. In previous winters I have heated the space with small electric heaters. I am now thinking, why not use miners to generate heat, support the bitcoin network, and generate some dust. I understand mining is not profitable, but I am already burning electricity to heat the space.Before anyone starts with the angle that I am stealing the electricity - I own the business, factory, trailer...In order, my priorities are:1 )Adequately heat the space2) Not excessively loud as it is my office3) Ease of use. I have not mined before nor do I write code or develop software. I do have an engineering degree and I am pretty handy, but computer science is not my background. Ideally I would like as close to plug and play as possible. I do not have much spare time.4) Generate dust.Any suggestions on hardware to achieve my goals would be welcome.Thank you.\n",

      "In terms of noise, I prefer the Antminer S3s. The fans on it are pretty low speed, and don't sound like a like a hairdrier or jet engine like the SP machines do. I'd just get a high quality, single rail 1200w+ psu (you can buy the corsair AX1200s for reasonable prices on ebay) throw two or three S3+s on it, and you are good to go. You could also buy a PSU designed for quiet operation as well (The RM1000 is the only unit I'm familiar with, which can easily support two overclocked S3+s)If that turns out to be too loud for you, you could look into soundproofing the area that you put your miners in, but I don't think you will have any problems in a noisy office environment... it should just blend in with the ambient noise.Curious to find out what your setup will be and how it goes... keep us updated!\n",

      "I am sure if we could put a group together interested in home heating from bitcoin mining that we could get an affordable and elegant device made specifically for this purpose.What I am thinking of is something clean and quiet that could sit on the wall in the living room or den and not have to be hidden in a closet. Another option would be a device that hooks into a hydronic water loop heating system. I'd like to start an interest list and make this happen, but we need a large enough group willing to invest in such a system to make the economics work out. If we could get one of the mining rig firms interested that would also be helpful. I've made some back-of-the-napkin calculations and I think the goal of nearly free heat is very attainable, even accounting for the initial investment in the mining hardware and heat exchanger.I'm looking down the barrel of a nordic winter so I could use this kind of system today. Who's with me? Ideal candidates for this system have the following characteristics:1) already using electricity for home heating2) long and cold winters3) own their homeThe folks at Nerdalize are developing computational heat exchanger modules specifically for home heating that would be perfect for mining also. They use general purpose computers for the computation/heat source, but I have talked with them about adapting their technology for Bitcoin mining. They are interested, but they would need a large enough order to justify adapting their modules for bitcoin mining. They have already run evaluations of a KnC Jupiter mining board and their systems could easily handle the high power/heat densities of bitcoin mining chips. They just need to see customer demand to justify more work in this direction.One thing to keep in mind also is that mining is about to start running into Moore's law. That means we could see 20 nm mining chips stay competitive longer than 28 nm chips, and future feature sizes even longer.This could also be a way to decentralize Bitcoin mining which now seems to be dangerously headed towards data center centralization.\n",

Even better is enough room to keep older generation mining and just add new next generation boards so you can squeeze the last coins (and heat) out of old hardware.All mining rigs are going to need the same thing - power, ethernet and cooling; the rest is just mounting.

      "I would love to see what you've done. I really think that future of decentralized home mining depends on also using the heat.Here's a simple back-of-the-napkin calculation - I would be curious to hear if people think this is wildly unreasonable or not.Let's say the whole thing costs you $1500 to build a 1000W system and you spend about $1700 in electricity for the season (Nov - Feb @ 24h x 30 days x 4 months x 6 cents per kwh) to run it. As long as your mining efficiency is better than break even for the power you'll make $1700+ in bitcoins. Assuming you were going to have to burn that electricity anyway for heat, your net cost is $1500 instead of $1700 for the season. Next season you only swap the mining boards so your cost is $1000 for 1000W, but you can reuse the $500 radiator unit. Assume you again break even, now your net cost for the season is $1000. Or, if instead you keep your old boards which are now mining at a 50% loss, then you spend $1700 in electricity for 1000W of heat and make $850 of bitcoins. Either way, you cut your power bill down from $1700 to $850 or $1000.If the bitcoin price goes up, your mining efficiency is > break even on power or you can use the heat all year (eg. to augment a water heater) then the economics look even better. If the bitcoin price crashes or mining difficulty increases faster than expected, you'll lose - but nothing ventured nothing gained. This isn't a get rich quick scheme, this is a get rich slow scheme. And hopefully fun; people spend much more to overclock their home PCs with no financial gain.The three financial caveats you need to accept are:1) you were going to spend the electricity for heating anyway (24x7 during the coldest months)2) your mining revenue is greater than, or equal to your electricity costs to run the mining boards (during the season)3) the up-front cost of the mining boards is less than the cost of a season of electric heatingNotice that the only real unknown is the mining revenue. However, it is safe to say that the expected return for any mining boards should be greater than the cost of the electricity or else no one would even consider buying it. From a strict business perspective, the mining operation still runs at a loss of the invested capital ($1000) even if you break even on electricity.A clever accountant might also recommend you treat the whole thing as a home business. Then you can deduct the cost of the mining equipment and electricity against the bitcoin revenue and deduct the loss on your taxes for a few years.Please let me know where my math is wrong; I know I am taking a big risk by proposing a profitable scenario in this forum. :-)\n",

After two days of settling, it had to have both air flow and light heat for the water to evaporate, so I dusted off the old L3+ miner and set it up to run air around the room while running an air dryer at the lowest setting. Didn't bring much in in coin, but was a fun to show to the workers that dropped by.Another thing I've been thinking of is linking liquid cooling from for example a bitmain machine (<link> to a central heating system. Mostly it's using gas to heat water to run through the radiators, but with an abundance of solar panels, even in winter there could be overproduction. Instead of pushing that back into the grid, could be used to heat and mine. unfortunately bitmain isn't giving them away exactly very cheap.\n",

      "Why would you need 3 phase for induction cooktop? You just need 220v for that, which is L+L (split phase) for U.S and N+L for the majority of the world, probably for the car charger?So most homes around the globe will have two wires, N and L, where the voltage between the two is 220v to 240v.When we talk 3 phase there are two different setups1- Three-Wire Just 3 L wires no N, the voltage between each two phases is 380-400v ( not sure what that is in the U.S) but google tells me it is 460v which won't work on the hydro miners if the number is correct, such setup only exists in industrial areas.2- Four-wire Wye 3 L + 1N , the voltage between L and L is 380-400v , between L and N is 220-240v, these 4 wires will run along the street and then house one gets L1+N , house two gets L2+N and so on, so despite having 4 wires running under or above your house, you get only 2 since as a normal house all you need is that, when it is a business or a factory they give them the 4 wires because while most of their machines would require only L1+L2+L3 , they would still the N to get 220v for the lights, TV and what not.So in the average country, residential buildings won't get 3 phase wiring, electric car chargers might change that concept, might have already changed that in some places.Back to weird U.S numbers, Phill's numbers match the result I got from Google, 460v is probably too much for the hydro miner given that the specs clearly state 380v-415v, I am sure you can find transformers in the U.S that can get you 400v instead of 460v, just not sure how popular those are.\n",

Fun fact, when designing power systems the component current rating has a much larger impact on price than the component voltage rating does.My guess is that BM just does not care because multi-MW transformers are *not* what one would call a 'standard in-stock item'.

Actually - that site has several excellent articles dealing with power distribution <link> mega farms pulling 10's to 100's of MW per-site have their own substations tied to The Grid's main transmission lines and can go a whole different route. Typically it is incoming xmfrs taking in 33kvac or higher from the utility and dropping that to a distribution voltage of 13kv or so which is sent to the mining warehouses to then be dropped to whatever voltage the miners need - in this case 400V - by several final transformers located at each warehouse or pod.When starting from scratch with a blank slate makes it very easy to accommodate different needs just by having different final xmfrs to provide 240 or 400 or 480v and segregating the loads accordingly.\n",

I cross tested to confirm I have working ports, they all have adequate power and fans right on em but they just won't stay running at stock speeds. Tweaking them slightly to the right as sidehack mentioned however 2 of the 7 just won't seem to hold 200MHz. I've spent a few hours trying to get these 2 sorted.... The other 5 of them worked perfectly. Also reaching out to 419Mining as well for their advice.\n",

      "Just as a note, all sticks are tested for a minimum of 12 hours at 400MHz and must average at least 220GH (80% speed) during this test to be cleared for shipping.These sticks don't run well at low speeds. You don't buy a Ferrari to drive Miss Daisy. These chips were made to go FAST and they tend to choke while slow. The higher the clock, if the voltage is stable, the closer they'll run to true. If you want to overclock one but it's stalling in low speeds, you need to --gekko-start-freq to a higher speed, and if it still has trouble stalling, --gekko-tune-up to a lower step threshold.For instance, I noticed some sticks have trouble below 200MHz and some have trouble below 300. For most, 300MHz is past the breakover point where they start running well. Therefore my test script <truncated> 400 --gekko-start-freq 300 --gekko-tune-up 85which means it targets 400MHz, starts ramping from 300MHz (instead of the default 200), and will step up when the measured hashrate breaks 85% of expected (instead of the default ...90-95%?)So Sledge, it's likely that your sticks are not faulty at all. It's more likely that you need to adjust command line parameters to force it past the sluggy bottom end and into the smoother high revs. If it doesn't level out above 300-400MHz, that's when adjusting the volt screw could start to make a difference.\n",

      "I strongly recommend getting the USB testers. I used this one: <link> was able to tune most of mine to a stable 340+ GH/s at 525 MHz at around 12.5-13W (4.8V x 2.7A). All i did was adjust the voltage screw clockwise a bit to match the volts/amps of the faster running sticks. Looks like I'm getting nearly S19j levels of efficiency at 36-38W per TH out of these which is kinda wild.I did have some finicky sticks under hashing around 40-70 GH/s. i thought they were defective as well but thanks to sidehack & kano's tips i got them out of that range into the 150 GH/s+ range. They eventually dropped back down but I will test on a separate hub & instance of cgminer and report back. I think I should be able to get them to run right with the correct settings & frequency. I've noticed w/ the newpacs some sticks do like to run a bit lower than others.One of the sticks was running fine at 400 MHz over 200GH/s for a bit but now gets 0 chips/zombie and seems to be pulling little to no amps. Any tips on adjusting the voltage screw? I didn't want to mess with it too much or over torque it. It was always properly cooled.Note, these seem to take a bit to ramp up to max speed when compared to the Newpacs. It took like 2-3 hours to work its way up to 340+ GH/s so def don't think there's something wrong with it if it doesn't immediately hit the higher hash rates.\n",

Considering how very very very very very unlikely it is that you will find a block, it would truly suck to get one and then have an orphan race with you losing because a pool with faster connectivity beat you to it. Any decent pool uses dedicated connections and routing to the BTC network vs your normal home internet connection which will take whatever path is available at the time.At current BTC value of just over $61k USD I for one would never risk losing $381,250 as loser of an orphan race...\n",

No idea if there's a way to run multiple diff frequencies under one instance of cgminer but i don't think so.Regarding the sticks running better at different speeds, with the Newpacs & these I've found that you def gotta play around with the frequencies a bit to maximize each stick. No idea if this is accurate by my guess is that the silicon in the actual chip responds differently to each frequency. That or some sort of combination of power draw per USB port, cooling, frequency and the environment all likely play a factor.I have had some that run measurably faster at lower speeds like 350-450 MHz than the same stick on 500+ MHz.\n",

Please reference attached image: <link> said that I have no clue whether that is an analog or digital signals. But it appears that Bitmain included temperature sensing into the chip/die.Further, Bitmain uses the Ti TMP451AIDQFR temperature sensor on their 17 series hash boards to measure board temperature. Which are currently unavailable from any supplier anywhere in the USA (But may be found on eBay or Aliexpress).

      "My original prototypes didn't have that part (330uF capacitor) included, but when testing with a high-impedance power source the voltage tended to sag and cause problems so I added some extra buffering. If you're using a direct connection to a decent hub, it's basically just insurance.Kano's driver is very unlikely to work natively with the BM1398. The chips enumerate themselves on the bus with a distinct ID per generation, which the driver uses to distinguish which chip (and how many of them) it's talking to. It won't recognize the 1398's response and so won't initialize it for use.Temperature sensing using the innards of the BM1397 also won't work natively. Bitmain implemented a register set that communicates with an external temp sensor over I2C using some otherwise unneeded pins, but this has to be built into the driver protocol. It is true that the two temp-sense-diode pins could be interfaced to any temp sensor chip and handled externally.I've looked into using USBC PD for higher power on a device, but at the time there was no real provision for running both PD and data, nor were there any reasonable hubs that would do the 20V spec. Additionally, providing a higher voltage into the device would tend to *decrease* your conversion efficiency, unless you used something like a forward converter with a transformer to help balance out the duty cycle. The problem isn't the power into the main regulator, it's the power out. 400mV 40A bucks are a rare breed. I've looked into this and it's sorta possible but I have something like eleven design projects already in the pipeline so I'm probably not gonna do it anytime soon.\n",

      "The operative word in your reply is \"natively\". While not having dug into Kano's driver to deeply it shouldn't be too difficult to add those ID's. Was more concerned that BM dramatically changed their comm protocol.Your response answers the question, for me, as to how BM reads the 4 external board temp sensors. Thanks.Having used a variety of USB hubs over the years concur that, by & large, they're all crap (save yours) for current handling. I was assuming I'd have to build my own w/ some beefy copper bus's for PD & the USB C connectors.Good point on the decrease in efficiency w/ a larger VDC I/O spread. Kinda' assumed there would need to be an intermediary step down located close to the chip. Like 20V to 5V or 20V to 3.3V. Just use the 20V rail for PD to the port. The device plugged into the port would need to do the step down. Like what is used to do Li battery / Supercap charging in USB connected devices (cell phones, tablets, etc.).In my experience, low V bucks (1.8V & 0.8V) are the realm of CPU/GPU power supplies & are usually seen as multiple units in parallel appropriately sized for the demands of the device. Which obviously would not fit in the Compac X form factor.Eleven projects? You're a braver/smarter man than me. I wouldn't be able to juggle that many projects.Thanks for all the clarification.Pup\n",

      "At this time I know exactly nothing about the BM1398 protocol and cannot advise.Remember any intermediary steps will have their own power losses, and efficiency percentages cascade. Two 90% stages in series still results in a 19% power loss, and if you 20V into 5V you still have the problem of trying to get reasonable efficiency out of an 8% duty cycle switcher. I'd be more likely to take 20V down directly with a half-bridge forward converter and custom wound transformer especially if it was a one-off. That's how a lot of your good active-PFC supplies handle bucking 350+VDC down to 12VDC at a hundred or more amps.The eleven projects can largely be subdivided into a few project families with a decent amount of overlap. Eventually I'll be fully excised from the assembly line and can focus more on R&D. That's the dream anyway.\n",

That would also allow for higher PD than 100W.

      "It would NOT change what PD can deliver. Same as with the USB charging specs the power delivery voltage is a wired negotiation between the master and slave(s) where there is a set of resistances presented by the slave device across the power wires when you plug it in. Something like either 10k, 4k or 2k as I recall. The master sees that and sets voltage output - up to 26vdc - and current limits accordingly. The regulators in the slaves of course need to be able to handle that so if no initial handshake resistance is seen by the master the port limits output to the standard 5vdc @ 1A.That out of the way, a USB-C PD port can both deliver power and handle data -- it's just that data has to come from/go to a different master (for data) device port. In the case of say a laptop using a powered USB-C hub with a PD port that is sized to power the laptop (up to 100w) the hub is the master for PD while the port on the laptop is the master for all data xfrs. The one cable between the laptop and powered hub handles both power to the laptop as well as data to/from it and the hub then splits off or passes through the (data only) to whatever is plugged into its data or display ports.\n",

It's a BAD idea.Solo mining to your own wallet has a MUCH higher risk of losing a block.I agree the above opinnion.I print out some details of transactions in block headers from bitcoin core. I found bitcoin core has an major problems that it sometime provide fewer transactions (eg. 10 transactions) included in getblocktemplete return message. So, the block headers from the bitcoin core may be wrong sometime, I believe. But, solo miners couldn't do anything with bitcoin core in regarding the numbers of transactions included. This is a key issue for bitcoin core to be used for small solo miner independent mining action.I believe that bitcoin core with cgminer in gbt_solo mode, solo miners will get a big risk in reliability issue of block headers. eg. your block header got only 10 trans, others got 300 trans. This may be a problem for equal opportunity right in bitcoin network??? The bitcoin core may be usable for running your own wallet without realtime reliability issue. But, it is not purpose for yourself solo miner's mining.I heard some pools can get all transactions packed and just wait for previous block hash coming in. Then, their block headers is formed. Much quick. Or if a pool resolved a block, and delay submit, and form a new block, and hashing it out. So, a block is resolved in few seconds from the same pools which often been seen. It is rare chance to resolve a block with a nonce. But, it is even hard to find second nonce for the same block. So, often, saw a block would not be solved for longer time, then, suddenly, few blocks are solved in next few minutes. It is funny thing in bitcoin mining. Or corruption? Or equal opportunity right?

Even hubs traditionally known for mining sticks such as this type probably won't suffice, because so far stick miners pulled way less current.This high current requirement is kind of new, since the Compac F to my knowledge is the first one to pull almost 3A or 15W from one port. I think this is even outside of official USB spec; hence any non-mining-specific products won't really cut it.Nonetheless, it seems the person who recently found a block with these, runs 3 miners on a single BitcoinMerch 10 port hub. Keep in mind this only delivers 120W, so 12W per port or 2.4A, which is still within USB spec. However you won't get the F's full potential if you limit it to 2.4 Amps.I actually had the 4port version of the hub from this kit and it didn't work well, even though it should have been able to deliver 2.4A to at least one port. So I'm not saying the 7-port version will not work, just to be careful. It uses BC 1.2 spec to deliver 2.4A, just as the 7-port version; and from my knowledge in BC 1.2 the device needs to 'ask' the hub for the full wattage (which mining sticks don't do).It seems if you want to use one of the typical 2.4A hubs, you will not be able to put more than half the amount of theoretical maximum devices into it due to power limitations. What I mean: often the hubs are advertised as: \"2.4A 10-port hub\" but only come with e.g. a 20W power supply. In that case, you would only be able to power a single of those 10 ports with 2.4A.Meanwhile, I believe you can put 7 Compac F's into the GekkoScience hub (but you need of course around 100W PSU - hub comes without one).Otherwise I'm not sure why @Sledge0001 chose not to put all 9 miners into a single hub.

And I not speak about a barrel jack just some mm copper pad on the usb stick nothing big and no components to add.Low voltage has a lot of losses on small section cables.That's the official USB specification : Multi-lane SuperSpeed (USB 3.2 Gen 2) device 1.5 A[d] 5 V 7.5 W2.4-3A isn't within specifications need an USBC connector for these type of power delivery and it's add a huge layer of complexity.It's why all usb devices USB 1.0/2.0/3.0 consuming more power than about 0.9-1.5A have an external power supply connector for stay within standard.A direct copper cable on a copper pad are in all cases better for keep voltage than a USB connector for this type of consumption.You have a certain number of stick aligned with your cooling/power supply/cable/custom design but in 2/3/5 years where are too weak you trash all these stick and replace them without change anything just solder the 2 wires on the new stick but keep all other part forever. Each part are independent and can be replaced but designed for your power available.

      "First of all, that's trivial to do (don't see the issue) and secondly, you can use any type of connector to provide the extra power. It could also be feasible to solder thick wires with USB-A on the end, though, I suppose.In case you want to do this, I have to revise what I said about soldering to large VDD and GND planes: the ones I thought about are obviously not at the right potential and would skip the power regulator circuit, so you need to solder to the existing USB connector's contacts (plus side: they're nice and big).Yes, you need thicker cables due to high power. So what?That's wrong. 2.4A is definitely in spec. All my mobile devices are charged at 2.4A through USB-A - I think it's the USB PD 2.0 spec or something like that (commonly known as 'fast charging').If you want to go higher, of course that's outside the specification, but that's why I said that sidehack makes these with 2.4A in mind.. of course you can overclock higher if you provide more power through specialized hubs, but you could run them in-spec.Look at your phone. It has a single USB connector without external power supply, yet it charges at 2.4 Amps on a normal modern phone charger.Okay, so the idea is to keep the lower part of the stick (power supply circuit). Not sure that's going to save you that much money. Also it is virtually the same as in Compac, NewPac, 2Pac, but it is slightly tuned to the chip(s) that it powers, so they would need to make it somehow modular (move resistor to change core voltage and similar), and I'm not sure it makes sense to save at the very most $10 off a $250 device.\n",

      "Dude, a water loop with a few mini blocks for multiple sticks will easily cost you less than a single of these sticks. These aren't just USB sticks... (compare mining stick price to usb stick price, maybe you don't know typical stickminer prices? )Why not try it? Get a $5 USB-A extension cord, rip out the power leads, scrape some solder mask on the back (front) side of the miner (the side where it has the heatsink on), and solder a barrel jack or something to the large ground and VDD planes and solder two thick enough wires to the USB input + and - wires.This would be a reversible (even though not pretty) mod.It seems the sticks are limited to 850MHz; I am on 500MHz right now and around 2.6A, so I suspect for running 850 you will really need more than 3A, more like 5A (25W) or something, so it would definitely be a cool PoC with actual benefit.They're not made for 500mA. They need at least 2.4A, which some off-the-shelf hubs do provide (within USB spec), but 3A-capable mining hubs are preferred (look in this thread; there is sidehack's own hub and another one whose name I forgot - it's what was used in the recently found block by someone with 9 Compac F's).I don't get your point. What do you want to be swappable? You talked about the cooling system (watercooling). I don't get why you can't just take off the $2 heatsink that they come with and add your own cooling solution.

      "Why add a connector when you just not need any connector ?Need a power supply a wire and a solder point for solder directly the copper cable on the copper PCB that's the better way for have the higher voltage/current. You seem never have measured any data cable and view issue at each connector. In high voltage even a damaged insulator can cause major issue.People who want loss power on their USB connector use their USB connector it's not an issue but add a pad somewhere on the PCB change nothing with an easy way for cut power coming from USB. Voltage can't be take from 5V usb and another from another power supply for power.USB PD 2.0 it's 20V@5A. USB norm is a voltage and a current within 5m cable look what happen with your 5V 100A charger at the end of a 5m usb AWG28 cable by measuring the voltage and real current at the end you will understand the issue. It's not for nothing than voltage increase to 20V for transfer 5A with USB-C.Current is limited by cable section and length or even connectors.An industrial low voltage power supply isn't really cheap but yes you can keep all and you not lost any time because it's like hot plug an usb stick for replace the WHOLE miner and you can exchange easily each part (cable usb hub power supply computer for controlling stick and custom voltage source for each miner) without trash all like a pod. 5V USB or 5V from industrial power supply not need any change and like I already write a \"chip\" exchange = whole stick miner exchange not unsolder asic chip and solder a newer. Package probably not the same vcore change so no.I just ask two copper pad and a 0ohm resistor or removable fuse for cut usb 5V supply and provide directly 5v to the pcb like probably all other people since 7 years asking for the same thing Imagine how many time the people who made is own pod with usb stick lost time for design smaller water block put so many pipe who can cause leak too for almost nothing because hub port aren't correctly aligned for put one big water block. You think really that the cost is low ?It can just align 4 or more miners and put even an already existing cooler because it's like VRM IC aligned on mainboard or graphic card so something probably already exist for put that under watercooling and cost are way reduced just need to solder 2 copper cables on each miner and use standard material for all other.\n",

So you would gain a significant benefit from this mod and it should be pretty easy to try. Also it's reversible.Then I still don't understand what you are 'keeping' when upgrading to a new stick.

Thanks for input.Someone please tell me immersion cooling for Compac Fs isn't as simple as hanging the USB hub upside down over a sufficiently large and thick metal container full of low-sulpher mineral oil with only the device dipping into liquid.

      "EDIT: Kano's setup instructions can be found HERE: <link> guys.So some of you already noticed because of reseller presale announcements, but we're dropping a new stick built around the S17 BM1397 chip.We call it the Compac F. It is red. Hot-rod red.It is also made for overclocking. Hot-rod overclocking.The two photos above were taken from the same test. I haven't stressed my tester sticks past 3 Amps from the USB bus, but if you are able to keep everything cool, in theory, the hardware should be good for more like 500GH. Which is a little absurd. Kano is working on the driver for this guy, and we agreed to cap the speed to 800MHz (538GH theoretical) for safety and sanity's sake. Because of a new IC package design by Bitmain, the chips cool more efficiently, which when coupled with our proven robust Compac power systems makes this stick quite a machine.This isn't going to be marketed as a baseline miner like the Compac, 2Pac, NewPac. It's physically compatible with our previous USB sticks and built off the same proven platform, but this one is a limited release with only one planned batch. If enough people want it, we may make more.Resellers are all the usual suspects. 419Mining, ASICPuppy and BitcoinMerch are stocking in the US. Bitshopper.de is selling in Germany, and Eyeboot.com will have stock in Hong Kong. MineFarmBuy is also interested but are a broker, not a reseller, so you'll have to talk to them to figure it out.\n",

      "I may experiment come summer. Would definitely be interested to know if anyone comes up with an effective, basic design that isn't a fire hazard... The following is just a little brainstorm..Does immersion simply allow overclocking more safely or is there anything about it that inherently adds capability (i.e. \"cooler chips hash better\")?Sidehack, you earlier mentioned the Compac F theoretically reaching speeds of 500GH/s with adequate cooling. Do you suppose that instead of frying the chip, with immersion you'd then simply be running into the limitations of even the best usb hub before such a fast hashrate?Does a higher voltage (via adjusting screw) necessarily mean a faster miner or could it possibly result in its running less efficiently (i.e. hotter)?I'm impressed that Sledge manages to keep his sticks at 75F (585MHz & ~380GH/s) using only an Artic fan per 3 sticks (he did mention their being in a temperature controlled environment). I'm wondering how big of a role fine tuning the voltage could play in maximizing efficiency (especially with regards to temperature).\n",

      "date: 2022-02-06 16:20:57\n",
      "Adjusting the voltage allows for higher operating speeds, because faster switching speeds require more power to make the switches switch faster without choking. Tuning for the lowest voltage at which the speed is stable is how you optimize efficiency. At super high speeds, even with good cooling, you're not running into hub limitations, you're running into limitations of the power delivery parts. The main inductor is rated for 17 amps and beyond that, you start to saturate the magnetics and regulation suffers. Basically, even without cooling, it wouldn't be safe to operate.In general, up to that point, better cooling means it'll safely run higher speeds. Might need to pipe in power directly if the USB jack has problems.\n",

I just run a basic installation of Rasbian and have it setup to run headless when I create the SD Card. I do everything else in PuTTY via SSH. The hardest part for anyone who is new would be compiling cgminer but there are plenty of tutorials on this forum (and I think even in this post) to get anyone through (including myself).Each adjuster has it's own position for the most part as originally I tried finding one spot and set everyone of them the same. Because each ASIC is a tiny bit different due to silicone lottery there isn't a complete one size fits all solution if you are going to push it past the 400MHz that the sticks are originally made for. You also need to have a USB power draw thing (I don't remember the technical name but it plugs into the USB port and the stick plugs into that) for testing and adjusting voltage because you can end up with way to much power even at 500MHz if you have too much amp wise if you adjust too much on it. After I finish each stick I just move the next stick onto it. So you only need 1 of them and they are less than $20 on Amazon.I think you are going to continue to have problems on a Windows based machine. Each stick upon receiving them I did run myself on my personal desktop (at the time a AMD 3950x on a Gigabyte Aorus MB, but I used a USB hub that could provide 2.5A so even at 500MHz it would get angry at points). The PI is a cheap very easy to setup solution and you can just set the sticks up with some kind of cooling solution and forget about them really. I monitor everything through the default miner.php included in cgminer.\n",

I still think it's a cool idea, so nice work there.As for hub stock, we got hit by parts price increases pretty severely so had to take the thing back to almost zero to redesign for parts we could source affordably. Couple that with a fairly time-inefficient case manufacture process and limited time available for dealing with issues around CompacF manufacture and you see the problem.

      "It's about the same process for all my sticks going back to the original Compac. You fire up cgminer set to the clock speed you want it to run at, and if it runs smoothly (basically, not a lot of errors and the hashrate should be close to GH=0.672*MHz) you can dial back the voltage a bit by turning the knob anticlockwise. Repeat until it starts to run poorly, and now you know where the threshold is so turn it back up a little (knob clockwise).If it runs poorly from the start, turn voltage up (knob clockwise) until the numbers smooth out.The most efficient mining will occur at the lowest voltage setting at which the numbers are stable.If you're looking to maximize hashrate at a particular power draw, tune the stick to a particular hashrate and check the power use.

      "elsupreme The USB sticks aren't the only thing you need to consider when trying to adjust amperage. Your USB hub and what each port can provide voltage and amperage wise is also very important. I have the Bitcoin Merch 7 port one and I can tell you it's not great. Just like others have said, it has power problems and each port is inconsistent. Then not only what each port can handle, but how much they can handle when multiple ports are used. For me, I can only achieve a stable 445Mhz @ roughly 2.4 - 2.5 amps per stick. I have found that each port resets at different max amp draw causing the plateau and this decreases with each USB stick plugged in with the first port drawing the most power and amps which takes away from each port as it gets farther away from the power source. Use the USB ampmeter so you can watch and tell at what max amperage does it plateau and from that, you can then tell your approx max freq you can use on that hub. That is the most likely case of your issue.As for eyeballing to set the rest of the sticks off one, good luck. Each stick and USB port is different. So you are better off adjusting each one, one at a time. Otherwise you are either going to be under volting getting low hashrates or overvolting for the hashrates you are getting.For anyone achieving 500mhz or higher, can you please let me know what your hardware setup is like and model of your USB hub?\n",

Most 'Amazon hubs' won't work well with these :/If you have an ammeter (image below), you can check if you're in a good range. If the stick is only pulling e.g. 0.7A, the hub won't work since it would mean it doesn't deliver enough power. If it's pulling more like 2A or 2.3ish amps, it looks good, but do note that the sticks can run faster if you allow them to use more than 2.4A which is the maximum which you can usually find on regular USB hubs.Maybe try setting frequency to 300 honestly (after installing a fan). They really don't like to run slowly. There are also other parameters that were talked over a lot in this topic, you can look around a bit and try the different suggestions, makes no sense to repeat them over and over (you're not the first one whose sticks didn't run perfectly out of the box ).Yes, the screw in question is physically on the PCB.

That's because many of them only deliver the full amount if the device requests it through actual USB messages according to the USB power delivery specs.

      "It's very hard to find a powered USB hub that provides 3A per port because that's way above the USB3 standard, so it's non-standard by definition.A standard USB3.0 hub has a maximum of 0.9A per port(4.5W).[1]Hubs that support the USB Battery Charging 1.2, or BC 1.2 for short, work up to 1.5A per port(7.5W) [2]There are <truncated> ways of going beyond that. The most common value I've found is 2.4A (12W), for example that's what the 7 port hub from bitcoin merch delivers. [3]If you need to have a hub for USB2-3 devices that deliver 3A per port you can either buy a used one (the gekkoscience one and others are all sold out AFAIK) or, if you're more adventurous, there are some people making custom developments and sharing their designs. Here's the post[4] and the actual source code for the design files of a 4-port USB2 hub with 3A delivery per port (15W) [5]. In theory you could DIY your own USB hub with 3A per port using those files if you have the skills.Ideally the next generation of USB miners should be done with USB-C, which allows much more power in a standard way. For example, the Dell dock WD19TBS has a USB-C that provides 3A (15W). [6]USB-C allows the creation of devices like this guy, a 4 port USB-C hub that delivers 12A per port (60W). [7]I'm not sure if there's a way of delivering power to a USB2-3 device from a USB-C hub. But that could be worth checking.After a quick search, it looks like it might be possible to use one of these new USB-C hubs to get 3A per port.

      "Even than if it worked, I would find these kind of miners with usb-c highly dangerous. People, who doesn't know much about electricity or doesn't make some research in this topic can easily burn their homes down only by plugging a usb-c miner in a hub and letting it behind running without any super active cooling. They would/could think, it's a small n cute, noiseless device - which it is -, compared to a 1000W+ asic miner, so what wrong could possibly happen?! Well... The thing is, in my opinion, that people are broadly used to using fastchargable and other devices, what support 20-60-120W input capacity. They, in most cases, only see the number and think the bigger, the better and don't even know, what it in fact means. It's a hell of a load. Maybe I'm wrong and way too precautious but even 12-15W is enough dangerous, if you don't know how to handle it.With usb-a miners, though, there can be theoretically no problem regarding heat. I mean, you can cool them down with a fan or two and don't need any uber extra knowledge. However, if you want to use usb-a miners on high frequency (aka high amperage) and max them out, you must do some research beforehand, in order to accumulate a level of understanding what's going on in the background. Otherwise, you're stuck with the idle, \"safe\" frequency, or with older usb miners, which are safe to use and almost PnP devices compared to a compac F.If someone want to mine for a living won't buy any low hashrate, unefficient usb miner and additionally geather the pieces they need to get them work, but a robust 1000W+ asic. For hobby miners and DIY fans should a usb-a compac F or something similar be enough to play around with. It's rather about fun, possibility of solving a block in this case, than being profit driven. I'm not saying usb-c would be a dead end or would be bad, I only find it risky and a bit too dangerous. That's why I reckon usb-a miners are enough. Who knows what kind of super-chips the future and the developer misterminds bring us.\n",

      "I see your point, but I think it is to some extent. It already can melt with an usb-a connector, than with a usb-c it is preprogrammed to melt. Since, usb-c chargers and hubs handles a higher amperage --> higher wattage. To be able to get a higher current out of a usb-a you have to educate yourself. You cannot go to a general store and buy the first hub you see as it is with usb-c.A bit longer explanation:With a regular usb-a the average input lies at around 5V/1,4A=7W and the cup is around 5V/2,4(3)A=12(15)W. Usb-c starts from here. Usb-a was meant firstly for data transfer, usb-c for fastcharging and data transfer. The cable is important as well, however, we don't use any cables to usb miners, therfore would be theoretically irrelevant if usb a or c. But the charger types/hubs were designed to cover the above described power demands, that's why we hardly find any usb-a hubs, which can support not 3A but even 2,4A.We can consider this kinda involuntarily built in protective mechanism. If you don't do your research and you don't understand electricity a bit, cannot overclock or even use your miners properly.Let's assume, there would be a hipothetic Ferrari2 with usb-c connector and 2 BM1397 ASIC Chips. It could draw ca. 30W or more. Anyone who has a common 30W+ usb-c hub can without any research and understandig easily just plug the thing in and it would run. But for what a cost? If a compac F melts at 15W, what could do 30W or more (e.g. 120W) with a device without any super active cooling? There wouldn't be enough 1 fan for sure.Correct me if I'm wrong, but safety first. If someone can start a device without any deeper education, no matter the consequences it'll do so, because people tend to be comfortable and lazy.\n",

      "No, no, the Compac-F does melt without cooling. You can also easily build a NewPac with a USB-C port and it won't melt without cooling. Just because it handles higher loads doesn't mean you have to push that far.The future stick miners could also just ship with fans and fan shrouds out-of-the box and then it would be pretty safe to sell them as-is.\n",

      "I'm curious were these results measured at the port or just what speed CGMiner is running at? Honestly I have been unlucky with the SiPolar hubs and I have 3 of them. It's not that they don't work and they do appear to be legit hubs. The issue arises when I try to push the miners to where I know my other hubs perform and they start consuming above 2.5A a port.My experience is that I feel like they are limited to only allowing 2 miners and an Arctic Fan on each SiPolar hub. I simply can't get them stable past 540MHz due to a lack of power. I can watch the power consumption go up on each port when tuning but as soon as I get past that 2.5A mark I believe the port /hub is going into protection which results in a miner crash / reset.My ICONE hubs are running 3 Miners on each at 590 - 600MHz with an Arctic Fan which tickles the 3A mark on each miner but they don't seem to go into protection.

      "What are some of the best ways to ensure these miners are running stable, getting proper airflow, and are not getting too hot over time?One thing I've checked is that the required power at the given frequency remains stable. This will depend on how much the USB hub can provide, for example 400MHz would require about 2A, and 500MHz would require about 2.4A (which is the maximum for many USB hubs). You can of course go higher if the USB hub can deliver that much power per slot. If there's no tripping on the hub, and the software remains stable, this should be fine. You can measure this with one of those cheap USB power meter testers you can get online.Now, in terms of heat, I'm not really sure how you could ensure the device is not running too hot. Of course you should run a fan pointed into the aluminium heat sink, but I'm not sure if the angle/distance plays a huge role. Also, at some point the fan might not be enough. Not sure how to establish that.I've been thinking about maybe getting one of those thermal cameras to monitor the temperature. What would be a reasonable range of temperature for normal operation with this device? Also, are there any components that are more critical regarding thermal conditions? Should it be cooled from the back and front as well?, or it doesn't matter too much?So far everything seems to be running smooth, but I'm not sure if I'm just slow cooking the miner\n",

I am just trying to find tutorials to figure out where to start. I bought some GekkoSience USB Miners and never got around to using them. I recently moved and am looking at finally getting them up and running but again not sure where to start.On Hand currently I have 1 Newpac I got off of EBay over a year ago and never messed with. I also have 1 Compac F I ordered from Bitcoinmerch last year and have not messed with yet. I also have this these HUBs on hand: 1 - BitcoinMerch.com - Powered 7-Port USB Hub USB 3.0, Upgraded 65W Compatible w/USB Miners Newpac, Twopac, Moonlander, Antminer, US Plug 1 - Sipolar-USB Hub- 10 Ports USB Data Hub-Industrial USB Powered Hub - USB 2.0 Hub for Mining, Bitcoin MinerI also have many computers sitting around largely not being used (Linux, and Windows and Raspberry PI 4s, a RPi400, some Zero's, ZeroWs, ZeroW 2s and 2 Radxa Zeros). What I don't use for this project may go toward setting up some RPIs for mining Monero.Items on Order arriving in a week or so: 1 - SABRENT 60W 10-Port USB 3.0 Hub Includes 3 Smart Charging Ports with Individual Power Switches and LEDs + 60W 12V/5A Power Adapter (HB-B7C3) 1 - HPE 511778-001 750watt Gold Power Supply (renewed) and expansion PCI-e board - to power the Terminus R808I have ordered another Newpac and a Terminus R808 off of ebay that should be here in a week (lets hope they work) as well as another new Compac F off of Amazon (also from Bitcoinmerch).

If I can join these to a pool and by chance something comes of it so be it. If not at least I can say at least I tried. So my questions to the Gekkoscience community are: 1. What is the best tutorial to follow to get cgminer up and running on a Raspberry Pi 4 so that it works with the miners I will be using? (I have come across mentions of needing specific versions of cgminer based on what USB Miner I have.) The Bitcoinmerch site lists a few commands but I do not know if that is for the best version of cgminer.2. Should I attempt to try and run these all on the same RPI 4 or should I split them up and do a few on one RPI 4 and a few on another RPI 4?3. Regarding the Raspberry Pi 4, does the amount of Ram make a difference? ( I have 4gb and 8gb RPIs).4. Should I attempt solo mining or do a pool? Its all a lottery with these right? 5. I have seen references about running a full node. I even saw some videos a while back on Youtube mentioning you can possibly get rewarded by hosting a node but again not sure how that works. I have many computers options on hand to choose from for a node (Linux, and Windows and Raspberry PI 4s, a RPi400, some Zero's, ZeroWs, ZeroW 2s and 2 Radxa Zeros), only I am so green I am not sure if running a node makes sense.

You can always do solo mining with these for example at ckpool solo, and you will be running a lotto every day. That works, but very small chances to win. You can set it up in a pool, or nicehash maybe, but you will be paid very, very little per day, say dozens or hundreds of sats or less, and that's assuming the pool allows you to provide such a small hashrate.Running a node is different than mining, any PC can do that. You just need a lot of space, say 500GB at a minimum for the full blockchain, and increasing. Just download Bitcoin Core and run it. You will be able to connect to your own Bitcoin node when it finishes updating in a few days. Running this node doesn't affect CPU too much. Running your own node helps you with better privacy, you also don't have to trust other nodes, and you can learn a bit more about Bitcoin. You don't have to be connected all the time, but you should be connected most of the time. Otherwise you will need to wait until it updates the blocks you missed while you were offline. About the rewards you mention, that's probably someone talking about a lightning node, which runs on top of a Bitcoin node. You can earn some sats by routing lightning payments. That one should be online all the time to make sure the routing goes through.I hope that helps you. Happy USB mining!\n",

I tweaked the voltage using the bottom right screw, but ultimately think downloading the latest gekko driver settings to ramp up the chips would have solved it.I wanted to confirm that my settings look correct in the first screenshot in order to keep these little guys on long term as a lotto play. difficulty 442, 400MHz, pool connection, correct cgminer version, correct github fork, etc.1st screenshot<link> had issues with one of the sticks constantly disconnecting (my words) and trying to ramp back up to the set frequency. This eventually went away, but I don't know why, so I wanted to post a few screenshots of it happening to see if anyone can identify what I'm doing wrong.Screenshot of the miner ramping up to 335MHZ (after I set it to 400 and it ramped itself back down)<link> of the miner going offline (my words, not sure what its doing)<link> of the miner w/ logs of it coming back online starting at 200MHz<link> I understand these miners are for fun and could maybe get 20-25 cents in a shared pool. However, I'm trying to understand if they even have a chance at hitting a block solo (I know the chances are 1 in 220million or something). Does my overall hash rate have to be a minimum of the current difficulty 29.79T to even have a chance? Just trying to understand the relationship of hash rate and difficulty.TIA\n",

      "Since you're running up to around 400MHz you're pushing the limits of what your USB hub can provide, so they reset and start all over again.I'm assuming you're using the BitcoinMerch USB hub:That USB hub is quite alright, much better than most, but it has a limit of 2.4A per port. You're hitting that limit when getting towards 400MHz, so try setting it a bit lower, say 380MHz or so. Note that it might be the combined power that is tripping the hub as well, so check your power supply to see how much it is providing. Experiment with different values per miner. You should be able to get up to around 480MHz with a single miner connected.You can confirm this by connecting one of those cheap USB measuring devices like this one:Keep going up towards 400MHz and you'll see that when it reaches 2.4A it will reset.It's really difficult to find a USB hub with data and power with more than 2.4A. The recommended one is the GekkoScience USB hub which is custom made for USB mining. It's pretty expensive and hard to find though.That one will allow you to go higher than 400MHz with no issues.If you do manage to get that one, make sure to have excellent cooling as it will get really hot.It's all probability, so think of it as a lottery. You have an extremely small chance of finding a block with these guys, but you definitely can. Sledge0001 found a block with one of those Compac F miners: <link> more hashrate you have, the more chances you have. But anyone mining can find a block, even on your first try!.\n",

      "Hello fellow miners I've got 3 miners, one of witch is acting weird. I have a gekko usb hub with 120W PS and active cooling of course. I run the miners with the following start line on cgminer's 4.12 version: <truncated> 420 --gekko-start-freq 350 --gekko-mine2 --gekko-tune2 85Two of the miners running smoothly and stable on 420 MHz with an avg. of 275 GH/s.The 3rd miner however was stable for a good while on this frequency but than it begun to destabilize itself.Example line from CGminer for the \"healthy\" sticks:0: GSF 1005xxxx: BM1397:01+ 420.00MHz T:420 P:420 (30:15) | 100% WU: 100% | 313.1G / 273.7Gh/s WU:3823.6/mExample line from CGminer for the problematic stick:2: GSF 1005xxxx: BM1397:01+ 420.00MHz T:420 P:384 (30:15) | 100% WU: 100% | 274.1G / 237.5Gh/s WU:3274.1/mThe first Mhz value and the \"T\" (I assume it means target value) lines up with each other, but the \"P\" (I have no clue what it could be, maybe power or performance?) never reaches the first two anymore and remains always below them. The \"P\" comes to a halt either around at 384/386 or sometimes at 404/416. (The performace depends on this, therfore the reduced hashing power.) Both percentages are sitting on 100%.The stick must be okay, because it can reach the \"healthy\" sticks' hashrate within the 5s time window, otherwise it couldn't get to it at all.I've noticed, if I put this problematic miner in pair (gekko USB-port-wise) with an other, it may destablize the one I put it in pair with. Sometimes, after several restarts (hotplug-out and plug-in back after waiting 10+ sec/or hours, or complete cgminer restart) very-very rarely the \"P\" value reaches the \"T\" but some times later it restarts itself and never reaches the \"T\" again.I've tried every single angle with the slightest turns of the little knob in the right bottom of the stick, every single usb-port or variation but nothing helps. I fresh and re-installed, both the CG-miner and RPi op.sys several times, no changes there. I tried different pools, just to see whether the pool's algorythm has any effect on the performance but this wasn't the answer either. This isn't rocket science, even so cannot solve the problem. Can you please tell me what \"P\" stands for and how could I get this value lined up with the others?It really would be great if I could get this stick working again.

Would be great if you can measure what each stick is pulling. If the problematic stick is below 3A, feel free to increase core voltage a bit and maybe point a fan directly on it to make sure these ~15W can be cooled off reliably.Also play around with your start speed. I have a stick that needs a pretty high start frequency to really get going.But first and foremost, label your sticks and figure out the settings required for each stick; they can definitely vary.

I tried every single slot and variation (alone or with the other sticks) as well, without any improvement.I have a current tester and it pulls at 420MHz ~2,4A. The flat side of the \"knob\" is almost in this position: _. If I turn it like / or | can't reach 100%, gets sometimes super hot and stops around 76% max 88%, than \"collapses\", restarts at a lower frequence. I tried more than 420MHz i.a. 450, 470, 500MHz without success. I think it should work at 420 just fine, because it is definitely above the 200-300 \"instability\" threshold. I'm starting it at 350MHz, but tried 380 or 400 with the same <truncated> Thank you. I must have overseen it, because I've read the entire readme and looked explicitly for the \"P\", but found nothing. Plateau makes sense now. I'm cooling the stick with the same 10 cm diameter fan, what I'm using for the other 2 sticks as well. The fan is placed directly above the sticks, if they run together. If the miner runs alone the fan is placed before the alu-heatsink so it blows the heat away and cools the heatsink down. The fan mustn't be a problem and its air-troughput is adjustable.

My stick is roughly between \\ and |, if I look at the stick the way it sits in the hub (USB port to the bottom, vertically down pointing towards planet earth's centre).

From 5-25 min the stick was unstable, couldn't even reach the 100% level.I see however, the problem rather be the CGminer itself, because it deregulates the stick for wathever reasons (can't be heat) and pushes its performance drastically back to the 180-260 GH/s range (Avg. 230).

      "Hi guys,Can anyone guide me to the best USB hub for overclocking 4 of these Compac miners? From hours of browsing today, I have realized that only the official GekkoScience 8 Port Hub is capable of giving 3A per USB port. This much is the minimum required to overclock it and there is no other, literally no other USB Hub on either Amazon or Aliexpress that has the capability to provide 3A power output on EVERY USB port. Is it a normal thing to find a skilled <truncated> repair guy and ask him to make a custom USB hub? Has anyone done this? Wondering this because the USB hub that works seems to be out of stock everywhere.Warm Regards,Anon\n",

      "Sorry for the late reply. Your troubleshooting and setup steps were the first I read, because I didn't want to mess something with the stick up and/or spam here. It was super useful and everyone should read it!!! In my opinion, there are some other very important \"soft\" variables one has to consider as a little amendment along your tutorial (if you have to make adjustments and the factory settings wouldn't be good enough) This post might will be a little long, but it worth to read, if someone has adjustment issues like I did.I got some new miners and I started everything from scratch by observing the new and good-running ones. Than:1) I unplugged all the miners and I took a look at the little \"Vcore-button\" of the new ones after doing an hour testrun with them, to see if their factory settings are ok. They were stable so I compared the Vcore settings of all these good miners. Most of them was almost set identically at 17 min.1.1) I copied this Vcore setting (17 min) and started the problematic at this point but it didn't worked out. It kept crashing. 1.2) I set the Vcore as I mentioned in one of my earlier post at ca. 25 min. (example from the NewPac thread: <link> Than I plugged the problematic stick in a usb tester in order to see the amperage.3) I plugged the usb tester with the stick in the gekko hub and started CGminer with my erlier compac F settings. (+ Fan of course)4) I let it ramp up and it stablized itself almost. I had to make a tiny adjustment turning the Vcore counterclockwise just 1-2 millimeters. But all this very-very slowly. I saw the amperage slighlty decreasing but the stick got up from 94-95% to 100%.5) I waited and observed the hashrate, amps etc. The hashrate gone up until the point it had reached earlier.6) I waited and after 5-10 min the hashrate begun to climb further higher (instead of crashing) and stopped at a point. I'd say 3/4 way through compared to the others' at 420 MHz.7) I've turned the Vcore slighlty observing closely the amps, the hashrate and WU-value. As I turned it in one way or the other the amps changed along with the other rates. BUT it is very important that it took some time until I saw the stick's reaction. So turning just a 0,1 mm, yes, \"0,1\" mm in one direction and waiting 5-10 sec to see the reaction. If someone turns it like 2-3 mm or more at once you can forget it and won't work. You'll see the stick's reaction of course but you cannot fine-tune or adjust it but it can crash due to the quick change. It was my expreience at least. It is like jumping in a tub full of hot water. If you emerge yourself slowly, little by little it won't hurt, but jumping... The same happens with the stick reducing or increasing the Vcore (Amps) like crazy - I reckon.8.) I saw the hashrate climbing up almost until to the point (2-3 GHs less) where the others were running. With this maybe \"rookie\" method I managed to fine-tune my miner in 4 hours.9) Along the road I've noticed that this stick got somehow hotter than the others and thus the cooling was an issue though. Hence I had this only stick to cool down I could point the airflow much centered at the heatsink and this solved the problem.What have I learned?1) Mark your factory Vcore setting before you want to make any changes.2) Always start at the 25 min. mark (see point 1.2 above), if you turned the Vcore far away from its factory setting or you don't remember this one anyomore.3) Be very-very-very patient and slow with the adjusment. (Only begin it if you have time and you're not in a rush.)4) Do it with only one stick in a hub at once and use a usb tester.5) Have a super airflow.You can find all these infos in one way or the other in the other posts before but I wanted to sum all those up here in one and stepwise. I hope it'll be helpful. Using multiple sticks in one hub0) Before using a stick in a pool be sure it is running smoothly alone. If not please see above.1) Start CGminer only with 2 sticks in a hub at once.2) When they are runnig smoothly and are stable, plug in one more. If stable, one more and so on. Don't start with 6-7 sticks at once. Maybe all of your sticks' setup is fine but the \"stronger\", slightly more stable sticks can destabilize the weaker and vice versa. ...and you end up thinking there is something wrong with the stick even if there isn't.3) In the meanwhile be assured they get enough air, what can cool them down enough. A fan from above spins in one direction and the last stick(s) in case of 5 or 6 may not gets enough air, gets hot and crashes, although there isn't any problem with its settings at all.\n",

      "Hey everyone! Quick question that maybe someone can help with. Ive been running a handful of Compac Fs for a few months - love them and how easy it was to get them up and running having used Newpacs in the past. My issue is this - I bought another one as I had 11 and one open high powered port on my second gekko hub. I got it yesterday - powered down the PSU that powers the 2 hubs (750W HP PSU with a Parallel Miner X11 breakout board), put the new stick in (didnt touch the potentiometer - have never really had to running them at 400mhz), powered up the PSU and started CGMiner on my Raspberry Pi. The new stick (serial number ends in 2807) which I got from ASICPuppy (I mention this because Ive bought 4 other CompacFs from him so I know hes not selling bad hardware and in my conversations with him he seems knowledgeable). The stick will not run with any stability at any frequency. CGMiner wound up tuning it down to 160MHZ and it wouldve continued to drop if I didnt stop it to investigate. I put the stick on my USB Multimeter to compare the current draw against another stick and it doesnt seem too too far off. I figured it may be an issue with power so I tried powering it alone in one of my gekko hubs - same thing when CGMiner is starting up it shows the current clock frequency (200MHZ), the target frequency (T) as 400, then (P) which normally ramps up quickly on my other sticks to the target Ive set seems to get stuck at 154 and after several minutes the stick just throttles itself. It has yet to achieve more than 55 GH/S. Is there any sort of fundamental difference in the Compc 8.2s vs the 8.1s that would requireI do anything differently? Current hardware and software Ive tried to troubleshoot this with is as follows:- Gekkoscience USB Hubs (tried the stick in several ports on both hubs)- RaspberryPi 4 Model B (tried using both the 32bit and 64bit versions of Raspberry Pi OS and tried running it on a Pi with Ubuntu)- software Im using is CGMiner 4.12.0- tried running it in my old Sipolar hub (each port has a maximum power output of 2.4a according to the specs)- tried notching the core voltage potentiometer in very small increments which didnt change anything)Has anyone else had any experiences like this? If yes - any ideas as far as what the next steps should be? I reached out to ASICPuppy but have yet to hear back from him and in the event I do t hear from him today, would like to try to figure this out if theres anything I may be doing incorrectly.Thanks!\n",

      "In my experience, every chip needs a bit more or less voltage; that's due to the 'silicon lottery' effect.Since you have USB multimeters: can you post how many watts / amps your 'working' sticks are pulling at a given clock speed and how much the new one is pulling at the same clock speed?How much did you increment it? How many watts did you reach? As long as it's under 3A, you still have some headroom. Also make sure that it's cooled properly, but I assume it is, since the other sticks seem to be getting enough cooling as well.\n",

      "Hey guys - thanks so much for your input!n0nce - I was only able to compare the initial current as it would start ramping up - which was the same as all of my other sticks. Trouble was I couldn't get it to achieve the clock speed I was setting so I wound up comparing it to another one of my sticks at 200mhz which was 4.96V / 1.671A (so approx. 8.25-8.3 watts). Sidehack - Initially at the end of the cg miner command line I was typing I was adding \"--gekko-mine2 <truncated> 400\". I tried adding the starting frequency (300) but it made it display the 300mhz frequency, T 400 P 0 for about 25 - 45 seconds and then the word ZOMBIE would show up for a few seconds and it would reassign the next consecutive # before GSF (ie. if it was 7: GSF 10052807, it would then change to 12: GSF 10052807, and the loop would continue). Was chatting with a coworker earlier who is a home-mining enthusiast also and he suggested I take out the \"--gekko-mine2\" in the text I was inputting and *knock on wood* for the first time, it's working! Running steadily for the past 45 minutes.

With this type of heatsink (relatively low surface area), I believe the added static pressure will be better for the sticks.A little 3D printed adapter like this will be needed, though.I would personally just turn the hub around and fix it in a way that it doesn't dip into the liquid, just to be on the safe side and since it's easy to do.

      "Yeahtrade secrets :-( So I didnt mean to interface the temp probes with CGMiner and have the data run through the Compac (that would be amazing but beyond my coding abilities). Ill have to dig through my random parts bin thats in the deep depths of my storage unit in the basement of my apartment building to take a photo - but I built a gaming rig when I was 14 or 15 (Im 32 now so were talking early 2000s when 5.25 bays were plentiful on PC towers) and I had a 5.25 bay mountable Fan Controller - it had 8 temperature probes and was able to control 8 (or 16 if you used the included splitters) fans. It was 100% hardware based - no software interface - just a big display across the front and 2 banks of buttons that controlled everything. The sensors were very, very thin and small film-type probes that would actually be perfect for a project like this. Me being a little bit anal, it would annoy the hell out of me to only be able to monitor 3/4s of my miners. Im trying to track down another one of these controllers but havent had a ton of luck.And I 100% agree with you about the fan attached to heatsink theory - seemed like a no brainer to me and I was pretty shocked to see that no matter what fan I used (I was testing the different between a Noctua NF-A4 20 and the BitcoinMerch supplied off-brand fan) that the temp was still considerably higher than running them without anything attached under optimal airflow. There is a guy in the UK who sells a much more well thought out mount that he prints himself called, if Im not mistaken, the IcePac - his mount looks like much more time went into the design than the one I mentioned. He has the fan angled up 20ish degrees to optimize the air flowing across the heatsink as opposed to most of the airflow being impeded by plastic on the top and bottom of the shroud. But - after my experience having spent nearly $300 for something that made my miners run hotter - decided against testing the waters with it. I run my Noctua industrial fans at full speed or at least close to it with the 12V pins on the side of the gekko hubs - the arctic USB fans towards the front run at whatever speed they are meant to plugged into 5V - and the ISB fans I got on Amazon run on the medium setting - havent brought a tach home to measure anything but I can attest to the fact that every heatsink on those 12 miners is warm to the touch. By no means would I call them hot.\n",

      "Good idea; such a stand-alone solution would certainly be much easier to deploy and still easy enough to use. Since it's generic PC hardware, you may even be able to use such a device to directly control one or more PC cooling fans to cool the whole stick miner rig down.In case you can't find your 5.25 bay stuff, I'm sure there is similar, modern stuff as well, with smaller footprints.That's so helpful, honestly! I was about to order those expensive little suckers, so you guys saved me a lot of money. Yes, these 12V pins are fantastic; makes for such a nice compact package compared to having a second PSU dangling around.I may have been running my fans a little bit slow (using a Noctua RPM 'throttle' to keep noise down) but I'll make sure to just run them at full speed in another room.\n",

      "So I will say this - compared to the Arctic F12 which performs similarly to the Noctua NF-A12x25, the industrial 3000RPM fans are pretty loud and I could see it bothering some individuals. I don't mind the noise - I actually enjoy some static noise when I'm going to sleep. But, these fans are also costly, I spent approximately $30 USD on Amazon for each fan. I'm going to make a short video so you can have a listen and have a realistic expectation of what you're in for before you go ahead and purchase anything.<link> Also - with regard to the BitcoinMerch CompacF/Newpac Fan Upgrade... I don't want to sound like I'm trying to attack the guy's 3D printed product. But, it is expensive for what it is, and definitely did not perform to what I considered the implied expectation (mentions that 3 Compac's can safely achieve 1.05TH/S). They DO cool the sticks effectively compared to something like, for example, a single Arctic USB Fan positioned so it is aimed at multiple stickminers (which I have seen lots of people do in photos online) but I don't think that they could sustain the advertised hashrate for a very lengthy period of time. I would imagine that most people who have this sort of setup are striving for maximum uptime. For me personally - I consider safety to be paramount. These stickminers are capable of producing enough heat that, if used improperly, could create a fire hazard.

There are multiple project online where people get industrial miners very silent (e.g. through acoustical insulation and / or placing them outside); ROI is definitely easier on those, but you need a higher budget.

      "Precisely.Remember, it is not only just 1 chip inside of any given miner that solves the hash but extends to being just 1-core inside of that chip (and these days it is over 4k cores per chip) that spits out the correct number. IF a miner of yours finds a block then what matters the most is how fast that is transmitted to your pool (solo or otherwise) and it in-turns broadcasts that to the BTC network so other miners can build on it to confirm it.Ja having a full-up ASIC miner with several hundred chips in it \"gives you more rolls of the dice\" per-second so to speak but as sledge0001 proved earlier this year, even against the astronomical odds a 1-chip stick miner CAN find a block. In his case it was one of Sidehack's Compac-F sticks that did it.But as other have said: Sticks are strictly for hobby or 'lottery ticket' use. Frankly, if you insist on pushing the envelope of those uses, just get an old s9, pull one of its cards and <truncated> it and get damn quiet several THs pulling around 800-900w.

Your issue may be different than mine but I decided to take a crack at it because the hub was only about 6 weeks old. I found that all of the solder was in tact - assumed one of the caps had broken loose or something so after I took the board apart, I noticed the lights on my USB MultiMeter turning on and off as I was slightly bending the PCB. SO! I removed the lower 2 gold-colored spacers from the middle 2 posts and used the lower screws to pull the center of the PCB down.

Especially if it's not too many chips, most desktop PCs should have enough free PCIe slots, enough headroom on the PSU under normal conditions, and the cooling solution would obviously be automatically taken care of, as well.I see availability and price of suited USB hubs (and extra PSU) as a big entry hurdle to stick mining, so being able to use what you already have (the PSU built into your desktop tower) would be great.\n",

Meanwhile if you were to setup a whole new watercooling loop for a bunch of stick miners, the 'overhead' in price is much higher.The chip doesn't need to be redesigned, no. The Compac F actually has an FTDI chip on it which handles the USB communication with the host and sends commands and data to the BM1397 over SPI or I2C, if I'm not mistaken. So the FTDI chip would need to be replaced by a PCIe chip. If there are driver issues, one could just pull power from the PCIe socket (I believe up to 60W is fine) and benefit from the PSU and cooling that's already set up within the chassis, but route out a USB connection through the back. As the card's back panel would otherwise have no I/O, it would be possible to add a single USB port where you plug in a short USB cable that goes into a nearby rear-IO-USB port.\n",

I feel like sub-1kW 'pod miners' are the best middle ground between low entry-cost (acquiring and running them) as well as low noise (relatively easy to cool) and still non-negligible hashrate. So I hope that's something you will be announcing.. Never got around to writing a Compac F review, but my biggest issue with it is that even if millions of it are running worldwide, the combined hashrate wouldn't amount to much more than a couple thousand industrial ASICs. It's probably not going to save the network in case of a coordinated attack from large mining operators, and users could gain more sats by buying $1 worth of BTC every day.However, if you can manage to produce miners with +10TH, it's going to be a whole different story.. The issue with e.g. filling up a GekkoScience hub to its max and achieving multiple TH is simply the overhead (one PSU circuit for each chip) in hardware and thus in cost and probably cooling as well.\n",

      "I'm saying this in the nicest way possible and I verified with the man, the myth, the legend Kano the information you are asking about aka the numbers after T/P which in your case are (32:16), etc. is not something to be worried about. Jack is new to Mining and does not know that for years (I'm talking back to 2014) the Raspberry Pi has been the control board for many miners. Hell the older Avalons products used a modified OpenWRT firmware on TINY TP-Link hardware. Bitmain used a custom board that ran the same OpenWRT firmware as well. KNC used the Beagle Bone Black on the Saturn, Jupiter, Neptune and they swapped to the Pi on their Ltc miner. The only OS regardless of hardware that will give you issue (and I can verify because I've tested myself on both a 3950X and 5950X) is Windows and it's poor I/O performance in the case of handling USB miners. Please refer back to my posts if you want to see screenshots but at 575MHz (on both T/P) which shows (22:11) pulling less than 3A per stick to keep the USB ports happy. The first and only person to hit a block with a CompacF also shows the same. I know people do not like reading 50+ pages of posts but if you are new to mining or never used something that didn't come with a preinstalled OS that you just plop your pool info in. You really need to spend time reading that. Every single question that's been asked has been covered already in this post and most are just information pulled from the other Gekkoscience product threads.I have 12 sticks running across 4 Gekko hubs, Apache running to view miner.php, etc. my CPU usage on my Pi 4 with 8gigs is 80% but it has NO issue handling data. Memory usage is 0. If you have ever used any other miner and could run \"top\" to see CPU usage you would be surprised that all run about the same.\n",

      "Very nice setup btw! If you have one stepping down it is because it is having trouble keeping up with that frequency and its a flag setup in the drivers so it can try to keep the stick mining by stepping down the Frequencies, this is fairly simple to fix thankfully if you have a USB voltage reader. The sticks from the factory are tested at only 400MHz anything after if it doesn't work right off the bat you have to adjust the voltage regulator on the stick. I personally do it with every stick so that I can keep each USB port under 3A at the frequency I am running it. There is a few post on here with how to adjust and remember follow like it says, a small change on the POT can be a pretty big swing on power to the stick. You can make the adjustment and start CGminer again and you are trying to keep % and WU: % pretty much as close to 100% on both, but when T: 500 and P: 500 you want both to be at 100% WU: 100%. During the start of the sticks it ramps up the power which is why those numbers will fluctuate and there is some information by Kano and Sidehack in here about it. It'll drop here and there as P rises toward T (target) which in your case is 500MHz. But if it does downclock itself the only way I know to reset the process is just to restart CGminer. I have used the Noctua's like Cygan has and some of mine still have them on with the 3d printed adapter. Mine were just powered via 3pin fan connectors as they come from the factory. They worked very well at 500Mhz-525MHz and I had 6 of them running across 2 Gekko Hubs. As I got more sticks I decided to just use 120MM fans up top to cool them down because I saw the same performance and it was much cheaper than buying 6 more Noctua's when I have a TON of 120mm fans laying around from other builds.\n",

      "i think you need to adjust the voltage screw. if you don't mind playing around with it, you can probably get all your sticks to run around the same hash rate with the same script / MHz setting as well. I used to run different MHz values for different sticks but I've found that if you play around with the screw at different positions then you can have the sticks running within 5-10% of the same hash rate. I've done this on prob 20+ sticks.Some you have to turn clockwise, others counterclockwise. there is no rhyme or reason.<link> the hash rate stabilizes lower than what you had prior to turning it, turn it in the opposite direction. sometimes you'll overshoot or undershoot. i don't even use one of the USB power consumption meters anymore, just eyeball it lol.It's somewhat annoying cause it takes time. You need to adjust it, leave it for like an hour or two, then try it again in a different position depending on how the hashrate behaves. i've had to adjust the position of the screw of a stick or two after a couple of months or weeks of operation, no idea why but it could be simply cause of a change in the ambient temperature.\n",

      "You maybe pulling too much power from the USB port and the regulator is shutting it down, have you been tuning that setting with the USB Power meter? I can't stress that enough even though someone said you can eyeball it, it's probably true when you are at 500-525MHz but at 575 you are starting to pull some extra power and if you aren't sure it is just going to keep failing. This is currently at 2 days of uptime, we had internet go in and out so I restarted Cgminer but prior I was on day 14. I am running 12 sticks all at 575MHz, as you can see in my previous pictures only 5 or 6 have Noctua fans, the rest are only cooled by a Noctua fan on top of them blowing down. Since I have 2x USB Power readers I literally spent quite awhile tuning them doing only 2 at a time where they MAX at 3.1A (some were not happy if I tried to keep at 2.9-3.0A). Each stick is different so what works on one, 99% of the time won't work on the other. I learned this long ago when I only had 3-4 sticks and started messing with the pot. on them. LOL!\n",

      "^^ remember that the max current per-pair of USB ports in each row of a Gekko hub is 6A so having 2 sticks on 1 pair with each pulling 3A or more will make the regulator for that pair of ports shut down and then hopefully restart again. My stick is pulling a safe 2.85A @ 575MHz so when I eventually get a 2nd I'd still be good with 2 in a row.\n",

      "Yup thank you for pointing that out because I was thinking in my case where until I got new gekko hubs I had to double up at share the 6A which at 550MHz I had all sharing plenty happy with head room.I have a few that run perfect at 2.85-2.9A but like 2 of them are just bastards that won't be stable unless they jump between 2.98-3.08A.

      "Honestly for this 'Ferrari' stick they're really a must-have. Shouldn't run you more than 10 bucks online and really help dial in the overclock.Too much voltage on the core, and the stick gets too hot and / or you exceed your power supply; too little voltage and it will be unstable. How much you're actually pulling though, can only be measured with such a meter.Keep in mind this meter measures the supply voltage and amps on the USB, so voltage will always be 5V and you see the current change, even though the pot on the board regulates the ASIC core voltage. This is of course normal since due to Ohm's law, more voltage on the core is directly proportional to more current going through the fixed-voltage power supply.You can either look at current or power draw; doesn't matter since 5V supply voltage is fixed, so just try to stay below 3A or 15W per USB port.\n",

      "There's 300uF (minus DC bias derating) of ceramics and a 470uF tant/poly at the regulator output, and then another 330uF tant/poly for bulk plus some 4.7uF and 0.1uF ceramics for high frequency bypass right at the power pads of the ASIC. It would probably run fine with either of the tant/poly missing, but not both.\n",

      "eeeehhh yes and no.... I assume that is a large value cap in parallel with the bank of lower value caps right? Ja the ASIC chip may still be operating because the DC is 'reasonably clean and good enough' but it would be interesting to probe there and at the chips power pads to look at the switching spikes with and w/o that cap...It is far too common for power supply designers that want to feed high current/high speed digital circuits to neglect the fact that chip switching speeds are deep into the RF spectrum making the DC power planes feeding them a transmission line. The end result is that as the gates inside of the chip switch the signal and DC power voltages at the chip pins can/will be quite different than what you probe and see as you get away from the chip.Point is ya should verify the at the chip itself that the Vcore referenced to its return pads along with the data eyes into/out of the chip look solid even without the cap. Neglecting that is one of the things that back in early 2014 killed Bitmine.ch's Coincraft miner which used their A1 chip that they paid Innosilicon to design and work with a Foundry(TSMC) to source. Well, that and totally neglecting the fact that that you also need sizeable heat sinks on top of the ASIC's... The folks that did things right used the same A1 chip in their legendary Dragon miners had great success with them...\n",

I haven't yet seen something like this specifically, but you could get a Noctua NA-FC1, 4-Pin PWM Fan Controller for 25$ and a SATA to PCIe adapter for 5$. Or maybe skip the latter, just cut a spare PCIe cable and solder it to one of the NA-FC1's supplied 12V power input cables.But I don't understand why wouldn't you just get a DC fan and plug it into the GekkoScience fan output or with a (easily to DIY) adapter into one of the extra USB ports?

      "It won't help you too much by only inrease compacF's freq. The maximum freq in cgminer for compacF can be 800 MHz. But, there are drawback in doing so:1. the numbers of hashed local block header data won't be increased significantly by incresed freq. We want more block header data to be hashed in per seconds. There is some bottleneck to limit effect of freq increase. 2. heat will be increased significantly, which may cause burning of chip.3. (5:14) or (14:14) or (28:14) indicator as I post before, will more significantly affect the number of hashed block header data than freq does. So, keeping (5:14) status is better than increasing freq. 4. Increasing freq won't increase output of found nonces, and won't increase quality nonces (which has higher diff), this is the key to success in mining. We want the nonce which can reach the target or higher diff. Now, too many nonces with below 10k difficulty. 5. Higher freq will produce more failed nonces which can not pass 1st test under asic boost mode. ASIC boost mode in BM1397 chip may limit the quality of nonces. I turn off asic boost, and got more quality nonce or more higher diff nonces. I set freq at 350MHZ and got 320 GH/s. No nned higher freq.6.

      "Ah sorry, this isn't correct.There's no such thing as making changes to get better 'quality' nonces.If it mines twice as fast it will get twice as many nonces.Due to Proof of Work, you expect that twice as many nonces will have, on average, twice as many of those nonces above any given difficulty.This result can be achieved by either 1) mining twice as fast or 2) mining with twice as many miners at the same speed.The ticket mask decides which nonces the chip returns and I set that to 16.If you set it to 32, you'd get half as many nonces in the same time, with the same average expected difficulty.Setting it higher just reduces the amount of data that travels back from the chip to cgminer by intercepting it.It has no effect on the 'quality' of the data, it just affects the average difficulty of the data by removing the lower difficulty nonces from the returned data, the chip still generates this data, it's just removed from the returned data, i.e. less data returned.Read here, coz it would appear you may not understand the meaning of difficulty: <link> mining is simply based on the fact that if you hash some data, 1 in 2^32 hashes will, on average, start with 32 zero bits.1 in 2^16 hashes will, on average, start with 16 zero bits.1 in 2^96 hashes will, on average, start with 96 zero bits.Asic-boost uses the idea that some of the hash processes can be reused for another hash, meaning the hash process is shorter in this case i.e. sometimes you can do the whole hash process a bit faster.It has zero effect on the value of the hash.\n",

      "Fix your quotes, dude.1, yes ticket mask is internal to the ASIC. Like he said, only nonces above the ticket mask are put into the stream of data coming back from the chip. It's similar to how cgminer will get a pool diff, so only nonces above that value will be forwarded to the pool server. 2. When you testd nonces, did you give it all of the appropriate data? ASICBoost uses an additional data field not previously implemented (left as zeroes I believe) in order to generate multiple midstates simultaneously from the same data. If you're not integrating that into the hash, most of your nonces would test bad because you're testing with incomplete data. This explanation is probably insufficient and Kano can tell you more.3.

      "Hi, I'm new to the forum, but not to hardware and mining.I have:- 18 of Compac-F sticks. - 2 x 30 port industrial USB hubs with 300W PSU (60A/5v) each, so plenty of power. (600W or 120A/5V)- Each hub has 15 ports that run on single USB (2.0) cord, 2 cords per hub, so I have 4 cords (but have been plugging in the second cord into the other side, so I only run 2)I have measured the consumption/voltage on the sticks and they go up to ~3A/4.8V per stick at 500Mhz @ ~ 320Gh/sThe PROBLEM is that I cannot run all 18 of them at once on my Raspberry Pi 4 (with the latest cgminer, your version)I ruled out that PI is a problem. It can run 10 or even all on ONE (either) hub with no problem (I run 9/9 these need spacing for cooling, plus even with this much PSU power hub goes down to 4.3V with 16 sticks in), but when I plug in the second hub, cgminer only sees 9-13 sticks max. PI CPU doesn't go over 60%, memory consumption is low too, so its has something to do with USB?I have tried different USB cords/sticks configurations etc....it must be some kind of USB restriction?Can you please help me with this?As a side question what's the minimum USB voltage they need to run? I know there is a voltage pod, so theoretically I can even run them at 4.3V (at the hub side) if my voltage at the chip would be ~1,45V correct? The only problem I see is my hub shows 5.2V when NOT hashing and sticks starting up and if I adjust the screw, until I'm at 1.45V DURIUNG mining for sticks stability, it could possibly go way above the 1,45V at the INITIAL stage of mining, when sticks are just starting up and not hashing yet, would that be a problem?Another side question - what file is a config file for current version of cgminer? I have used the save option during mining and now it looks like no mater what options I run the miner with it will run with the saved ones, I looked in the cgminer folder and there are tons of various config files. I assume if I delete the config file it will revert to default settings?\n",

      "I'm sorry I can't help with this; I can answer your second question.The buck converter circuit should give you a stable output, as long as the input is in a relatively normal range. I've seen 5V USB devices running on anywhere between 4.7 to 5.1V normally, but it's possible that 4.3 could suffice. Do note that the potentiometer doesn't affect your input voltage (5V side) but just the core voltage; so it's possible that other components such as the FTDI chip will stop working even though the core is happy. I don't think 5.2V is too much out of the ordinary, but I'd be careful of having voltages on the core of 'way above 1.45V' (how much is 'way above'?).It takes the config file if you specify it. I.e.: run it with the -c or --config parameter and pass the config file's path.The contents should look something like this:Just input the information that you'd otherwise pass by command line args into that file. Then you can run it simply with ./cgminer -c example.conf.\n",

Probably can even run on single hub, but will need voltmeter and pod adjusting...My problem was that both of my 30 port hubs are constructed with 8 usb hub chips each. Each chip controls 4 ports, so its like 8 separate 4 port hubs connected.For my two hubs system actually sees 16(!) 4 port hubs. It just cant support that many hubs.Each hub has 2 usb cables, one for each side, so each usb cable supports 15 ports or half the hub. I originally had all 4 cables plugged in into the PI.What I did - I only connected 2 cables to the pi, each cable goes to a half of each hub and loaded them with sticks (with single port spacing)This achieved voltage/amperage needed to run the sticks (both sides share the power line) without overloading the system with amount of hubs connected. I can only run 16 sticks this way, it will do for now.Hope this makes sense.\n",

What's the CPU usage?Mine is at 20% now, running 16 sticks at 500MhzThe way to see that your USB bus is overloaded is your CPU usage, it will skyrocket. It only happened when I plugged in another hub WHILE cgminer RUNNING. When it happens, just stop cgminer (ctrl-c) and run it again, to save your PI from extra heat, it should zoom at around 20% normally.If I plug in and turn all hubs on BEFORE i run it, it would just find x amount of sticks (not all) and just run normally at low CPU load. So, it the cgminer that gets confused by all the hub stuff and goes nuts.Btw, I'm only using USB 2.0 ports (white inside), don't use USB 3.0 ports (blue inside)Try only running 2 USB wires to PI (to USB 2.0 ports!), only from 2 hubs, rest of the hubs just interconnect, meaning connect the wire from hub 1 and 2 to PI, as for the other hub - just plug in the USB wire to hub 1 or 2.

A message does not automatically have to be a problem. He wants to understand what the message means and where else should he ask about this if not here in the appropriate thread.

Things didn't work for me so I am trying to figure out what the problem is. Here's my setup:- 1 GekkoScience Compact F- 1 7-pot USB hub from bitcoinmerch.com with individual switches and blue LEDs per USB port- Ubuntu 22.04 laptop- cgminer (I tried novak and kanoi versions from github)I plugged my mouse to the USB hub. It works. Blue LED lights up.I plugged my keyboard to the USB hub. It works. Blue LED lights up.I plugged the Compac F device to the USB hub. No Blue LED light. No Red LED light either on the Compac F.I see messages in dmesg when I plug and unplug the mouse and the keyboard.There are no messsages added to dmesg when I plug and unplug Compac F. I made sure the power switch is on.I used hardinfo app in ubuntu to check the list of USB devices. It shows the same behavior as dmesg.I've tried running cgminer (both novak and kanoi versions). Both say no device detected.Is this an indication that I received a defective Compac F device?Please help. Thanks!\n",

      "You right, I remembered doing it this way, I ended up reinstalling the RPI and Cgminer, didn't want to spend anymore time on it at the moment.Haven't mined for a while and finally started again, still trying to tacle the voltage drop.Power supply is constant at 5.2V (60A supply), even loaded, which is default voltage on the hub, so it's the voltage regulating chip in the hub.When hub gets loaded, voltage drops on sticks to like 4.7V, using about 3A of power. That's rining 8 sticks. (Same on second hub)Will turning voltage pods help much or this voltage is simply too low for the chip. What Voltage Chip should run at? (Range?)I can measure the voltage if you tell me where (I remember once someone posted the contact points, but won't find it now)What I'm afraid is turning up the pod too high in offset of the future V drop.My Initial voltage is 5.2V, I dont want to burn the chip if INITIALLY let in too much V. before the drop that will occur with load.Does it have thermal protection?\n",

      "Yes, you want to keep the power mode on normal when setting a power limit on the miner, it's almost impossible to bring the miner to an exact figure, so your 3050w limit will usually be slightly less, a few watts here and there, also, the power consumption on the tool isn't 100% accurate, so make sure you use a wattmeter to get the exact correct number.I would also look for a different tank, 6kw is too much for Antminer and a bit on the low side for 2*Whatsminer, but at the end of the day, the lower you go on these Whatsminer the more efficiency you gain overall.Also if the project kicks in and you want to sell the package as a 200th miner you would want to get the M50, they range between 25w/th to 28w/th, the lower the more expensive of course.The M50s 110th 28W would be a good pick, it should do 110th at 3080w default, so if you want it to stay at 2900w (to not go above 5800w for the tank) it will do 103th or a total of 206th for the tank.Meanwhile, keep in mind that you will remove fans in the tank, the reading on the wattmeter will take the fan readings too, the fans in the pics you posted are running close to full, they consume about 85w each at full speed (7k rpm), so the reading on Whatsminer tool will be a lot more accurate when the miners run in the tank.\n",

      "This sucks, and by the way, I think the basic version of this tank does not come with a heat exchanger, which means you can't re-use the heat generated by the miners, my understanding of immersion cooling is that there are two types, a single loop, and a dual loop, the tank you bought looks to be using a single loop, the miners are soaked into the liquid, a pump sucks in the liquid from the top of the tank into the radiator /dry cooler, gets cooled down, and sent back to the bottom of the tank.Using this setup, you have no way to redirect the heat to a place like a swimming pool, but can be used to heat a living room or whatever space that dry coolers blow hot air against.The second type would be dual loop cooling, this setup uses a heat exchanger, which has 2 inputs and 2 outputs.1- Input from the cooling liquid.2- Input from the water source (swimming pool or whatever).3- Output of the now \"cooler\" liquid to be sent back to the tank.4- Output of the now \"hotter\" water to be sent back to wherever you want (the swimming pool again).So basically the heat exchanger will take the heat from the liquid cooling and transfer it to the water without these two mixing together, you can probably build your own tank that does this, since you are located in the U.S and that's where most of the good grade cooling liquid is made, the concept is rather simple at least on paper.-A tank that can hold 2 Whatsminers (can be made of glass or some strong metal).-50-60L of cooling fluid (probably costs 300-500 for a good grade).- A small pump.- A heat exchanger.- A dry cooler.Of course, the final shape and those LEDs and fan control come at an extra cost, and they will be some trial and error, so a ready-to-use tank like the one you use has some merit, I would just confirm with them that it comes with a heat exchanger aka \"dual Loop\" system so that you guys can actually use it to heat the pool.\n",

I can't see them just strapping 2 together in parallel and running a single set of much heavier lines coming out of the pair. Parallel feeds to them from the utility HV lines sure, bonded together as a single output - no.No matter what the incoming service panel would of course have to be upgraded and it would/will probably be cheaper and certainly easier to just have a 2nd service panel to distribute incoming power from the 2nd xmfr. Of course you will need to monitor the 2 service loads to they stay within their power limits. As I recall you have some decent 3-phase power monitors in place for that With the incoming lines from the transformers to service panels being independent of each other, balancing the load between them is not really an issue. Just 80% max out your existing transformer and add future loads to the new xmfr distribution panel or shift some loads around if desired.\n",

      "Introducing the newest quiet consumer miner from GekkoScience, the newest addition to the Terminus pod-miner line, the R909.It may not look like much right away, but it's a significant improvement over the R606 in almost every way.This miner is built with the same physical dimensions as the R606 so anything built around them would still fit this unit. Airflow ducting is the same, same 80mm fan. However, you'll notice ports and jacks are located at the exhaust end instead of accessible from the side.This makes the unit more readily stackable, as you no longer have to keep three sides clear - two for airflow and one for cabling.It also allowed us to expand the circuit board by 15%, making room for a better main regulator and improved thermal management. Heatsink area over the chips is increased by 40% over the R606, and we've added more board mounting legs for improved stability especially during shipping.The miner runs on the S17's BM1397 ASIC, as used in our Compac-F USB stick miner. Kano has been hard at work improving the driver, and has added several features that will be very attractive to tuning enthusiasts, though the stock settings will already be fairly excellent.The miner is guaranteed to run at 1.5TH from under 100 DC watts at stock voltage and do it nearly silently. Better performance isn't guaranteed, but is probably attainable. Take for example the test unit I had running 1.8TH at 70 watts, or the above-photographed machine which pulled down almost 2.1TH from 88 watts (on stock voltage, no voltage tuning) for over a week:The Terminus R909 needs an external controller running cgminer, with USB connection to the miner (a 6-foot USB cable will be included with purchase). The driver has been tested extensively on linux PC and Raspberry Pi. Like previous Terminus models, the miner runs on 12V power from either a standard 2.1/5.5mm barrel jack (rated for 8A) or a PCIe 6-pin jack.The \"stock\" speed will be set to 400MHz, expected to see 1.6TH, but higher frequencies are possible. Kano will explain the details, but he's been working on adding tuning features which include setting individual chip frequencies. Core voltage is adjustable in the range of 1.4V-1.6V per chip, same as on the Compac F, and though the R606 had a fancy push-button interface, we've rolled back to a basic knob you turn with a screwdriver on this one. That may be improved on future versions but I won't make promises just in case.This miner also features Blinky Lights, but they're not as intrusive as previous models of pod or stick. The rate of blinking is proportional to hashrate. The base light color is a delightful pink-magenta.The BM1397 chips have a significant temperature coefficient, which means that they pull noticeably more power as they get warmer. Nobody at GekkoScience will be offended if a tuner or enthusiast upgrades the fan, as more airflow could mean reducing power consumption by 5-10% just from maintaining lower temperatures. These units take a standard 80mmx25mm 3/4-wire 12V case fan.And like all GekkoScience products, the Terminus R909 is Made In The USA.Approximate dimensions: 3.5 x 4.2 x 6 inches.SALESSo far, two resellers have confirmed to stock this machine, and should have stock in time to start delivering orders by Christmas. Production is already well underway on the first batch. This post will be updated as more sellers are <truncated> shipping from <truncated> shipping from Ohiobitshopper.de in Europe/Germany (forum user MacEntyre)The Terminus R909 will include a 6ft USB cable.

I don't mean that to come off as an attack, but this will be my 9th year on this forum and there are still trustworthy pools/solo pools you can mine on. What I do notice though is you follow any project Kano is involved with because YOU want something changed. I am sure like you said there are others but it's YOU that follows into Sidehack's product releases talking about how it's not truly something. Which as of right now and for the forseeable future it is as I do not see pools disappearing for awhile, and by the time they do this hardware will be the equiv to running an Antminer U1 on a modern day pool.Another analogy when it comes to the end of the pools, would be again comparing a person watching for the end of the world and prepping for it. It would be the same as calling every gun manufacturer and complaining that even though they only make the firearm that nobody will be able to make bullets for it if the world were to come to an end. You are literally worried about something that isn't a problem and have been all over any Gekkoscience release because Kano is involved. So how about you set up your own stratum server and run instead of worrying about mining directly to Bitcoin core? OR, how about you pay to have your own developer write a new miner specifically for people like you and the others you mention and then you don't have to follow people like Kano and Sidehack constantly trying to tell people that it's not a solo miner because in the future you can't just mine directly to core?\n",

I have been so busy, I buy the items when I see them in stock but keep getting side tracked. I have never even powered them up. Hopefully none are duds. I also have multiple USB hubs two from Bitcoinmerch and 2 Sipolar-USB Hub- 10 Ports USB 2.0 powered hubs as well as multiple RPI 4s in 4GB and 8GB as well as Radza Zeros, Libra Computer, a Neo PI, RockPi4b and multiple RPI Zeros and Zero2s. Anyways enough rambling, on to my actual questions / concerns - Are there issues with running multiple hosts? I ask as I am not sure if the USB 2.0 ports on an single RPI4 can handle all of the miners above across two powered USB2.0 hubs so I am thinking I may I run two RPI4s as hosts and run the Compac-Fs and the 909 on one and the older miners (two Newpacs and the 808) on the other. Will that work with two hosts mining to the same pool from the same Public IP address, or do I need to introduce a some kind of proxy to regulate work for the two miners? (I am not sure if a proxy is needed, but I read not to long ago about a proxy being an issue with mining Monero and thought I would ask about it. ) - Given the USB hubs have their own power supply does that make the USB power concern a moot point?Regarding power - I am thinking of getting a UPS with surge protection or a 10 plug AC power strip I have that also has surge protection to plug the RPI4s, POD miners and USB hubs with the usb miners into. Any concerns there? I am also thinking that if I go the multiple RPI4 host route, I can then split the electricity draw between multiple wall outlets so not to overload one wall outlet.Thoughts and guidance much appreciated.\n",

      "For the power supply, I'm using a +10 year old Corsair TX650 (650w, 80Plus Bronze). It won't be the most efficient power supply, because of it's age. Also power supplies are the most efficient when you use 50% of their total rated output power. But hard to find (impossible?) a 200w 80Plus Platinum computer power supply. And I didn't want to buy a new one, to only save ~1$ per month of electricity.It is kept on, with a \"jump start\" adapter, like these : <link> I use the 6-pin PCIe connector on the R909. In theory that plug is rated for 75watts (link). But I don't worry about that. Just check it's well plugged in.For the configuration and installation of the Raspberry Pi, I've got an old model, so I went with the command line OS, no fancy interface or desktop.To \"flash\" the SD card, I used RaspberryPiImager (link), selected Raspberry Pi OS Lite, and in the advance options activated \"Enable SSH\" giving a username and password. I'm using a SSH connection to connect to the Raspberry Pi.Once everything is copied, put the SD card in the Raspberry, and turn it on.Connect the Raspberry to the network. You'll need it's IP address to connect to it. You can find it on the router, or with a program like Advance IP Scanner (link).Once you found the IP address, you can connect to it with the program Putty (link).It will ask for the username and password you entered earlier.For the installation of CGMiner, I used Kano's website : <link> apt-get updatesudo apt-get upgrade -ysudo apt-get install -y build-essential autoconf automake libtool pkg-config <truncated> libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev gitcdgit clone <link> cgminerCFLAGS=\"-O2 -march=native -fcommon\" ./autogen.sh --enable-gekko <truncated> apt-get install -y <truncated> run CGminer, and start mining, I go in the CGminer folder (cd CGMiner), and enter this command :sudo ./cgminer -o mining pool -u btc address -p x --gekko-start-freq 400 --gekko-r909-freq 525I saw somewhere that you should be able to enter that command without \"sudo\". But if I don't enter \"sudo\", it can't access the USB peripherals. I'm too lazy to find the fix.I use \"Screen\" to be able to run multiple programs in the terminal (CGMiner and HTop) : <link> use \"HTop\" to see the CPU and RAM usage : <link> happy with it also. I ordered six Compac F, before the announcement of the R909. I ended up not using the Compac F, as the R909 is much easier to power, is compact, and needs only one fan to cool down (compared to the Compac F that needs one fan each, plus the USB Hub that has a fan also).For my question what numbers should I look at for the \"rejected shares\" and \"hardware errors\", if I looked up correctly, these are the calculation to get the \"rejected shares\" and \"hardware errors\" percentage :Number taken from my earlier screen capture. You need to take the values that are at the toprejected shares percentage = R * 100 / (R+A+HW) = 6944 * 100 / <truncated> = 0.046%hardware errors percentage = HW * 100 / (R+A+HW) = 7616 * 100 / <truncated> = 0.051%If these calculation are correct, I think I have some headroom to lower the voltage, and watt usage. 2Th/s was my goal, I don't want to push it more.On graphic cards, I'm happy when these values are bellow 1%.\n",

I had to change the hw code in cgminer to allow this correction (back when I added the ferrari)Also the lower accepted rejected count on your display doesn't mean much since share difficulty can change, so that's no longer comparing equally weighted numbers, just look at the top A/R/HW.\n",

      "Is there a general thread for Gekkoscience miners? Not just for the R909?I will mention this here since there is an R909 in the mix, but It may be better suited for a different thread. Let me know. I tried mining the nicehash pool this morning via cgminer, and though it works, the difficulty seems to be a little much. it is very slow and the R909 seems to hang at around 89% but still hashes at around 2.5TH/s. The Compac-Fs see to be the ones that struggle the most as a few of them will reset the frequency down to 200mhz and ramp back up. I am running 1 R9-9, 4 Compac-Fs and 2 New Pacs with an over all hash rate of 3.1TH to as high as 4.2TH/s. The pool settles on a difficulty of 40k and and overall it does get excepted shares, just really slow to handle them. That being said, I was curious if anyone else had tried to mine nicehash with usb miners. Is it worth it or is there an increased risk of damage to the miners? Anyone have suggested difficulty for nicehash pool?Here is what I used: NiceHash External Mining: sudo ./cgminer -o <truncated> -u <truncated> -p x --gekko-newpac-freq 350 <truncated> 400 --gekko-r909-freq 550I was thinking of trying it again with the --suggest-diff 20000 flag and then with --suggest-diff 10000 flag to see how those work. I have been mining ckpool with --suggest-diff 10000 flag to see how that went. it seems stable just getting about half the shares than if I let it auto set the difficulty. When I do let it auto set on ckpool it usually sets it somewhere between 2400 and 3400.

Sometimes it'd load up and work for a few seconds then drop out again, but most of the time it just doesn't work. I ended up in a pinch just using a second lab PSU for the laptop, just like the one powering my test R909, and it's been running beautifully at 600MHz for the last day on that setup.Didnt have the problem on a Pi controller, because it was running off the same clean power source as the pod.

So far, their most quiet fans in my experience are the A12x25, which even at roughly half speed (1000RPM) provide ample cooling and static pressure for my application while being almost silent. Of course, they don't fit this miner.Other Noctua fans however, need more RPM to cool properly and are definitely audible. Even larger ones like the NF-A14 PWM.I installed the NF-A8 PWM in the R909 earlier today and it sounds slightly higher pitched (at full 2200RPM speed) than the stock Arctic F8 at 2000RPM, although the sound is a bit quieter and more pleasant; the F8 almost sounded 'rattly' in a way; some kind of frequency was probably spiking higher than the others.Right now, I am running the Noctua with the included LNA (low noise adapter) at 1750RPM and that makes it almost silent from a few meters away. However, it results in a bit less airflow than even the stock fan.For now it works without issues at 525MHz and a bit over 2TH/s, but I definitely need to check my temps somehow.\n",

Yet still I am getting 2.487Th/s on average. Still super close to that 2.5 mark, or 3.8% lower than my previous result, while reducing clock by 50MHz, so a 7.2% reduction in clock speed.This indicates to me that above 650, we get into diminishing returns.I guess on its basic level, the transistors are going to be 'pushed' to switch faster; but in the realms of CPU overclocking I've never heard of a high frequency killing chips / diminishing their lifespan.

At the beginning of the run, cgminer reports up to ~2.5 TH, then, after 30min or 1 hour it slowly drops the hash rate.Currently, at 725 MHz (which seems the maximum, increasing it, the HW errors raising as well to an unacceptable ratio), the miner is dropping down to ~2.190 TH.Also tried to increase the voltage knob from 12 o'clock to 3 o'clock in small steps, to no avail. So I turned it back to the factory setting.The next step will be to measure temps and increase airflow if necessary.\n",

      "Hello all, i want to share my experience and some advise on cooling as i found out points to improve:I got 4units few weeks ago, all 4 came with bolts off in the case, initially i wasnt clear where they came from i thought they were spare bolts , but as i set them and ran for couple of hours at stock frequency 400 i saw the hashrate going down to 1.4T and they went down to zombie no chip that made me think about temperature issuesI open each of them, net it is not easy to open but that can be an improvement in future i found out:1 both heatsinks were moving missing the bolts i had at the boxes.2 the fans are pushing the air to the inside vs pulling it out3 there is no thermal compound on the backplate heatsinks what i did:1 put thermal path covering the backplate heatsink (20w/k), used same compound for the top at the BM chips.2 when bolting it i made a cross then center then cross then center until the bolts were full secured, 6 bolt array needs a sequence to avoid the issue of having some loosen bolts due to the center bolts will cause the outer ones to lose pressure as the heatsink gets tightened.3 inverted the fan to pull the air, why, the current setu makes hot air stays inside the case (measured with a temp camera) Results:550 stable - 2.2T each (48hrs no TH drops) very cold running- i kept them back there for longevity 85w per R909.600 stable - 2.4T each (48hrs no TH drops) temperature got slightly high, but still looks fine.650 stable - 2.6T in some / 2.5 in others (48hrs sone git back to 600Mhz) i guess silicon lottery and or needs better heatsink like cpu server with very small fins but many to increase thermal transfer and better fans <getting some 6k high cfm>As i saw risk of damaging the asics i stop there (i had compact F damaged due to temps, 6 and replaced the asics with new AI but after monitoring i found that thermal will kill the chips so fyi) I will do the same 750 test and report back just with one and try to measure temps with my temp camera.hope this helps to improve the thermal protection so far with stock heatsinks these toys performs amazing just make the backplate to really work adding thermal compound on it and you will really use the backplate to remove heat.\n",

But the air as it was not strong enough to move out stayed there in the front near the cables. with the changes the backplate is draining more heat from the pcb, pcb is colder and top maintained temps so contact issue was the initial problem. Then all front part is about ambient temperature, as air gets higher speed it is 2 to 3 degrees lower just cos pressure changes, and the air going out of the fan and case is hot.I am running it at 650 now and here the temps i just captured as i was intrigued on how much temp gets from 100Mhz more:FP= 66 (some are hotter 69-72)Pcb = 36-37 relative coldBP= 50 (seems it still gets heat out)EX = 49 - 52I assume with current stock fan might get too hot to go higher on freq, not sure the asic temperatures down there but they should be extremely hot. 650 had maintained 24 hrs at 2.6T stable (21 degree temp intake, maybe cooler temps can allow it to go higher on freq. - mine anything higher than 650 starts to bounce back to 650-646 and i get lower hashrates.\n",

I will test it so we can see if works but what I decided based on the construction of 909 was to set a stronger pull fan as I see that will be enough... at the end these are 150W tops devices and to make it push-pull cable needs to be routed differently to make the fan on top no \"gaps\" and create a tunnel at the 909 chassis. Also power consumption won't be great if we add fans and 6k fans pulls a lot of power at full speed. To me is a balance on the lower power possible and the highest hashrate possible, which I just haven't found it yet...I don't see it worth to change design for push-pull, I would better look for a pipe/type dissipator/heatsink with very close fins like the ones used at server CPUs, that will maximize the airflow that passes. I am trying to find in the market any CPU like heatsink that I can try on it before I convert them to water cool as I have the compactF (just learning if the current air-cooling can get improved, but my end point is water-cooling it as summer is very hot here and air density is quite poor).But well it is all about learning and experimentation so couple of usd worth it (at least to me).I am using some alpha cool memory water cooling same as for the Cf to cool them down, I am working on the holders to leverage the 6 bolts and the backplate which is a great add BTW! so doing some design/testing to assure PCB does not bend. I also ordered some SSD and custom memory watercolors to see if they fit better than the small Alphacool NDXs. I will test before I move them to water and share if it improves... for now 650Mhz @ 2.6T for 48hr and heat is well managed by the current design just with the few mods I did.

If silver or gold each pin *can* handle up to 5A per pin. Since there are 3x circuits and each takes 2 pins (1 feed, 1 return) you get the 15A max for the 6-pin connector. Safe max for tin plating is just 3A. Those max ratings also are highly dependent on what gauge & type of wire is used as the wire pulls heat away from the connection.

Otherwise yeah if anyone who understands the hardware better and has done overclocking can speak to if i shouldn't have been running at 600MHz is the issue, or if it's just that one that may have had a problem to begin with, that would be cool.Being that i think that R909 was already an exchange for a 909 going down for other reasons and Bitcoinmerch has a warranty policy regarding running it above 500Mhz, i'm now hesitant to clock the other one back up to 600 anyway. That's why i'd like to clarify if 600 is actually any issue or in that one had some flaw to begin with. I've seen a few people in here talk about running it up to 700MHz and it self regulates down if there are issues. Also why i'm hoping someone might know what would have blown and if there is actually just a way to fix it. I don't think my reseller knows anything about repairs.\n",

After having owned a Futurebit Apollo that operated at about 200W, I was looking forward to the R909's sub-100W rating.But in practice, it's even lower! I haven't fiddled a lot with voltages, and I'm getting about 1.88TH/s with <85W at the wall (including power for the Raspberry Pi)! I'm using an old Seasonic Gold rated PC power supply that's not even at peak efficiency, since it's rated for 450W.Without cgminer running, my meter was reading about 12W, actually. So if you're running cgminer on some sort of homeserver that you have up & running 24/7 anyway, you can save another 10W.For one R909, a ~120W PSU would probably be perfect efficiency-wise (they are made to peak at about 80% load).This makes it really viable to even do lottery mining in central EU where we pay on average about 30 cents per kWh. Basically, this unit will cost you under 20 in electricity per month. Or, of course, you can go with a pool as well. cgminer runs quite stable for me on a Raspberry Pi, connected to kanopool.

I presume you've got the bm1366's connections from tracing the signals on a hash board and not from an 'official' repair guide? There are a few things that stand out to me and might be worth looking in to;- the mode_0(in) and mode_1 signals are connected together. &&- the decoupling caps c4 & c16 are connected to to these pins To me it seems as both pins are actually ground (vss). You can check for connection of these pins with the big ground pad to see if that is correct.- the mode_0 pin is left floating for mode0 Antminer has previously defined mode0 as mode_0 pin connected to ground.Changing the description of these pins and of the mode does not change the functionality of anything but seems more correct to me (if the 2 connected pins are actually vss).Did you find a way to log the communication with the hash boards or are you going the software disassembly route first?\n",

Excellent updates and services as always.Few issues:-1) Web UI doesnt update/shows inactive even when pool side reports hashing (known issue)2) No Red led light at the front at all, even after multiple reboots.3) Initial setup was done through the Web UI, But now when I plug in a monitor and try to log in it says \"incorrect password\"Any way to rectify numbers <truncated> numbers 2 & 3. 2) the led is disconnected. Not sure how but it looks like it hasnt been soldered on properly.

      "DaveF, I was thinking exactly the same thing. Could be an issue with the existing fan. Ive ordered a couple of different variants myself as I never got a reply from support after the initial query regarding the LED.I suppose it all depends on the starting voltage of the fan. Most 12v fans have a starting voltage of 5v so if that was to dip lower then it would stop and struggle to start again. As you said 3.3 to 5v is a tighter margin so should hopefully be ok *crosses fingers*. Its all trial and error at the moment. To be fair the heatsink is keeping it below 75c under moderate loads (when updating the node). So it may well be ok in my circumstances to run passively. But I just dont like the idea of it.\n",

Back then people tried to run 12V fans off the 5V rail to reduce noise since for the most part you did not need the airflow that you need in todays PCs. But, it caused a lot of them not to spin at times. Once they started moving, even with a flick of a finger they kept spinning. I know there is a big difference between a case fan and the little one on the CPU and 5 to 12 is a much larger gap then 3.3 to 5 but could that be causing some of the early death issues?

At least I wanted a more convenient way to switch between (test) setups. Only Linux is supported and tested, but the code (bash script) may be ported to macOS.Feel free to use it when it adds value to your setup. While this script can (and should) be executed as regular user, apollo-miner won't work out-of-the-box for non-root users. But this can easily be fixed by adding the user to the dialout group.

Inch it up until things start acting odd?Last thing I want to do is melt the hardware down, but I want to utilize the extra wattage in the most efficeint way possible.Third thing, I have a linux box(Mint Mate) running full nodes for Digibyte, Decred, and soon Unibright. Would I be better served using that as my controller for the Futurebit ASICs?Thanks again for an amazing product!!$DGB\n",

      "I can answer part of your question.I have 1 full node and 2 standard units and I have each one running on a it's own 500watt power supply. I have power set to MAX (95%) and frequency set to MAX (60).Max power usage is 277, 270 & 268.I'm getting ~3.8 Th/s on all three.Total hashrate on the mining pool is 11-12Th/sI've had them running for 1 week and so far they have not caught fire. :-)I have 3 more standard units coming from the 2nd batch and I assume they will run fine plugged in to the powered USB hub.\n",

      "Adding to this a bit. I am running this on 95% with the frequency at 54 and was getting around 3.5-3.6 TH/s on the pool. I tried it at 60 but the TH's rate fell to 2 TH range for a bit so I bumped it down. I've also been messing around with the Newpac USB miners and one of the things I've noticed while overclocking those is that it seems each chip had its own ideal frequency range. Some chips run faster at 485 MHz than at 515 MHz for example. I suspect these might be similar. Gonna try 55,56, 57 next and see which level it runs best at. Afterwards I think I will decrease the power range a bit, I just tested it at 90% and saw the same or similar TH/s results. Note - I added 2 fans that I connected through USB and currently get temps of ~55 C to 65 C. Normally the temps were 65 C - 73 C so I think they easily drop the temps by 5-10 or so. I felt adding it would make the stock fan work less hard over time and operate more efficiently.PSA for anyone that wants to get a cheaper PSU that I can confirm works with these:<link> - Dell 03MJJP ~$20 (after tax/shipping)<link> - Breakout board ~$20 (after <truncated> to my calculations, this can actually host the full package + 2 standard units all overclocked to the max by itself for less than $40-$50 after cables. It seems these pull about 270W maxed out so if you used this PSU to run 3 units you should be under the 900W this puts out on a standard plug. As always DYOR but just wanted to put it on people's radar.I am currently running this + 2 gekkoscience usb mining hubs with no issues. I was initially worried the PSU might be too loud since its from a server but it seems the entire set up is surprisingly quiet. When I move it to balanced the PSU slows down the fan speed as well and gets even quieter so that's pretty cool & unexpected. You can't hear it at all over the AC.\n",

Came today, all good. Went to fit it, it's slightly higher than the original so needed some modifying but made it work. That's not the problem though, the problem was putting it all together. Went together just fine, turned it on and... nothing. No IP address, nothing on the screen, nothing. Pulled it apart again, checked if anything was not plugged in. Nope all good. Few more power cycles, few 10 minute waits, still nothing. Strip it down one more time and look on the floor... oh, there's an SD card there... FUCK! I must have knocked it out while working on the fan for the SBC. Plug the card back in, reassemble and bam, instantly comes to life.So if anyone has an issue please don't be a dumb ass like me and check if the SD card is actually in and seated properly!\n",

      "I kind of disagree with this. The point of running a node is to be able to broadcast your own transactions without using a 3rd party. Whenever you use a client like trezor wallet suite or the ledger app, you are using their node to transmit your bitcoin on the block chain. You are essentially trusting someone else to be honest with your bitcoin.while running a node does benefit the network because you seed block data to other nodes, verify other transactions & \"listen\" for attacks, there is a benefit to running one yourself and using the data you verified yourself to transmit a transaction. you don't need to trust anyone to send a transaction. in an emergency such as a nation state attack, running your own node would be the only way to 100% broadcast a transaction with privacy & assurance.--That said - does anyone know how to actually install bitcoin core on this thing? I am new to linux/ubuntu and not very familiar with how to trouble shoot things. I tried installing Bitcoin Core but didn't really have any luck It would be nice to be able to use this device to broadcast transactions using my local node's data.I have never installed or used Bitcoin Core or sent a transaction using my own node.

(this may have been a problem with my internet connection)[and the hdmi just started working after a reboot \\_()_/]3) this one is much less urgent, but is there planned support for a dark mode on the dashboard? right now i'm just hashing in eco mode and using the web dash to manage things over wifi. i have the sd card image downloaded but waiting for feedback cheers,plank\n",

I run an ASUS GT-AX11000 Router - one of their high end gaming routers and evidently the 'Two-Way IPS' logic inside the router was blocking the connection to slushpool. Of course there was NOTHING in the firewall's network protection dashboard that indicated this to be the case, but as soon as I disabled 'two-way IPS' the miner worked.The background on this is as follows... I was pulling my hair out for two weeks or more trying to understand why I couldn't connect to any pool and then tried testing it using a VPN and discovered the connections were successful if using a VPN. Since I knew that running the miner inside a VPN tunnel works, the question is, what is not 'seeing' the traffic due to the VPN? - Well, Comcast isn't seeing it, that's true and my ISP was what I was afraid was causing the issue. But with the VPN in use, the port filtering on my firewall/router ALSO isn't seeing traffic to e.g. slushpool, and that's why subsequent connection attempts worked.

      "Each of our ASICs have ~4k SHA256 engines in them (so ~175k in each Apollo). Only one of these need to be bad to throw a really high error rate. Error rate is calculated against good solutions based on an internal solution difficulty, not ALL solutions produced by the ASIC (would be impossible/waste of resources to do integrity check on each SHA256 pass). What happens with a bad logical core is that ALL solutions it produces are spit out as valid solutions, then the miner software does a check on them which are determined to be bad solutions, so the calculated error rates ends up inflating higher than it really is. Normally each core produces an random amount of error that just has to do with spontaneous logical errors that happen in the chip due to low gate voltage, this is what the error rate is supposed to convey, but we cant easily catch the kind of errors that have to do with a bad logical cores.

      "There is certainly a point for getting in early: If you create a LN channel now with let's say 1M satoshi, it will cost you around 400 bucks and people can transact up to that amount in this channel back and forth. But let's say you keep that channel for multiple years, the value that can be transacted with 1M sats is ever increasing and e.g. might reach a point where it's the equivalent of thousands of $.This way, channels created early (even small ones, <1M sats) gain usability and 'size' (in value terms) as Bitcoin value increases over time.However, I don't think it will ever be something very profitable, even with many more transactions, since fees are by design low (1 satoshi - realize how little that is per hop) and the market is competitive the better the network is connected. The protocol tries to automatically use the routes with lowest fees - the more routes, the less chance people will use an expensive node since they'll find cheaper ones that bring them to their destination.\n",

Double-check your USB node drive is plugged in the USB port in the back of your Apollo, properly formatted with the folder name \"Bitcoin\" in the root directory, and press the Start button below.The wording of this confuses me as my understanding is that the node operates on the NVMe SSD rather than through a USB drive (granted, I'm a noob, so maybe I'm misunderstanding how the terms are being used).

After a few hours they stop mining, looks like a lot of people have this issue. But I'm getting a message related to a segmentation fault in screen: Command terminated with signal 11 (core file generated). For the time being I wrapped my start script with crypto_curious's script from page 14, and they haven't stopped mining since. However I dont think enough time has passed for me to consider this a good fix, we'll see. Some people in this thread suggested the issue could be related to a bad connection to the internet, which is definitely possible in my situation. I'll setup something to track that when I get back on site. Im wondering if anyone else has seen the \"Command terminated with signal 11 (core file generated)\" message in the screen session running the miner software. I am on Ubuntu 20.04 with an older kernel 5.4.0-58-generic (needed for issues related to GPU mining). My only other gripe is the miner output is extremely busy compared to other miners Im familiar with like trm and xmrig. What stats should I keep an eye on?

So your attack vector isn't any different if it's an Apollo unit or another machine; everyone would be equally affected by a Core bug. However, for privacy it would be indeed nice to not tell everyone what machine you have; after all, this leaks that you're mining. Mining is banned in some countries for example or requires a permit since it's seen as a business and stuff like this. So I agree it would be good to be able to turn it off.Usually any NVMe SSD with 1TB should work fine. Samsung m.2's are very popular, and just a bit more expensive than the cheap stuff.

      "Advertising bitcoind version (0.21.1 in your case) is harmless. Every bitcoin node out there advertises its version so it can efficiently communicate with other compatible nodes. However, when you reinstall system, <truncated> string will disappear and your node will become generic bitcoind. This setting is configurable somewhere in bitcoin.conf, read the docs for bitcoind if you want to change it or keep it after reinstall.You assumed bitcoind is running in Apollo as root? I don't think that's the case. You can verify this in ssh session, just run htop.I suggest reinstalling OS on Apollo, see below. You can run bitcoind as a separate user (to decrease escape risk) with generic version string, that's what I do.That was my very concern when I first put my hands on this machine. I have reinstalled Armbian Ubuntu (default system in Apollo) to Armbian Debian, headless, ssh access only. See my post with details:<link> can do something like that. For me, not applying security updates on Internet-exposed machine is a big no-no. That's why I reinstalled. Since this post, I upgraded system to latest Armbian-Debian 11, did even more Telegram stats, it's been running great. Also I moved it to another country, so I am bitcoin node operator in two countries now If you decide to go reinstall route, you have endless possibilities. I have 1TB USB spinning HDD connected as a node drive, formatted to Btrfs, so I have checksum warnings, had this drive already so cost was free. If you need to have it nice and tidy without extra equipment next to it, as it was, just buy any 1TB SSD, if will be all right. Bitcoind is barely using SSD bandwidth and speed anyway. Have fun\n",

      "Exactly, I Previously had 2 gpu-mining rigs, one running 12 cards the other with 5 cards. Having 2 power supplies is fine as long as you have it set up correctly. First youll need a piece of hardware like add2psu which connects the 2nd-slave psu to the master, you can also use a paper clip if youre willing to take that risk. The main thing is to connect the peripherals to 1 psu and not both. For example for mining rigs the gpu riser and gpu will be connected to 1 psu so both pull from the same power source. You should never connect the riser to one and the gpu on it to another, that would cause problems. So Im terms of the Apollo dont plug 2 separate power suppliers into 1 machine..My old rig ran 24/7 for around 3 years straight never had any serious problems or fire related incidents, you just need to know what youre doing\n",

I found out that it was not the unit but the fan itself as the lower temp and faster rpm followed the fan from unit to unit.I further looked at the fans closer and notice a distinctive difference.Batch 1 (4 units) I got had these fans with smaller gauge wires and a different wiring pattern.Blue yellow red black<link> 2 units had larger gauge wiresBlack red yellow blue<link> fans do have the same order at the plug to the board just different going into the fan.

But you have to use USB cable between Apollo miner and your custom SBC, as jstefanop uses proprietary GPIO connection protocol in Full node miner, so you can't use GPIO pins.If you are planning to use exactly the same SBC - OrangePi 4 - this is possible. Full node and standard miner are exactly the same, one just has Orange Pi4 via GPIO and NVMe installed and other one doesn't. And full unit has different one side panel to accommodate HDMI and the likes on OrangePi.I know as I replanted OrangePi successfully from one full node unit to standard unit, because USB port on standard unit was broken off when I opened the box! So I removed OrangePi and bits and installed in that standard unit, making it a full node. It works, miner now works via GPIO not via USB port which was broken. Didn't wanted to claim warranty to jstefanop team and waste a month time, it was not worth it when I was already almost certain that it would work. And it did. Former full node is now stripped standard miner and it works as a slave to upgraded master miner.\n",

      "To upgrade to a larger M.2 SSD without an enclosure, I first got a second SD card and imaged it using the resources from the first post. That was more of a precaution than a necessity.Then, since my node was fully in sync on the original SSD, before I replaced the M.2 SSD I use the full node's file manager app to connect to a valid SMB file-share target on my home network and copied the node's data-files to it. It's way faster copying ~400 GB of data on your home network than it is to wait for the node to re-sync from scratch. Then I shut everything off and replaced both the SD card and the M.2 SSD. Upon bootup the OS formats the M.2 and starts to sync the node, which will take days. So, that's the time to stop the node, reconnect to the file-share and copy the data-files you backed up onto the new SSD, overwriting whatever the node just recently created with what we know to be complete data files. Then all ya have to do is re-start the node and it'll sync any changes that occurred while you were working on the full unit. That'll take minutes, as opposed to days.HTH\n",

For anyone who don't know how to mitigate this, device should be returned for a repair.I noticed this flaw, and fixed it somewhat by raising Orange Pi 4 fan voltage from 3.3 to 5V where it should have been running from the start - fan is rated at 5V but have been slowed down artificially.

Therefore, shutting entire device because you actually use it as advertised (Turbo Mode + Desktop use, or Turbo Mode + Bitcoin Node syncing) is a factory defect. I resolved defect in my unit myself (rewired small fan back to 5V supply), but I can imagine surprise of many less experienced enthusiasts who wake up to see their brand new miner, set to Turbo Mode, dead cold in the morning, because it has shutdown during normal as-advertised operation. Or even more disappointment when a customer would actually try to use that Desktop Class Computer for a minute and it would shutdown suddenly.

Goal of the device is to run Bitcoin apps/wallets in an easy to use manner on top of the full node/miner. Even when we start offering things like Lightning Apps these won't take up all the CPU resources. Your free to game on it if you want, but expecting it to work flawlessly while doing so and running the hashboard in turbo is definitely not what we advertise and way beyond the scope of the device. Ive also explained many times that you should not run in in turbo while doing the initial sync. While we have tested it and works fine in our test setups, there are environments (over 35C ambient) where the CPU could overheat. It only takes the device 24-48 hours to complete a full sync with a good internet connection so the downtime is not much if you really want to run turbo 25/7.

I'm likely gonna keep them on eco mode since the efficiency makes more sense for me with my high electric rate, but wanted to confirm so far turning down the hashrate has helped the stability issues I had with running 3 units (1 full 2 standard). Not sure if it's an internet connectivity issue since it seemed to happen while the rest of my internet is working just fine.

Since stopping the node, the Apollo BTC has been running 3 months without failure.It never made any sense for me to run the Apollo BTC unit with a full node as I have RASPIBLITZ on an 8gig raspberry PI which has a full BTC/LND nodes.I can only suggest anyone with a similar internet provider problem do a week long experiment as I did and just stop the node all together to see if this helps until the software matures.\n",

      "v0.3.2 ReleaseNext version of the Apollo Web UI has been pushed to all Apollo users (you should see a yellow update button on the upper right screen, or refresh the page if you don't). This is a significant stability and bug fix update and also includes the latest miner binaries with many fixes, and latest Bitcoin Core v22 release for your node. Its recommend that every Apollo user upgrade to this version, we have resolved most remaining issues and has been rock stable in our tests (check out our 19 day uptime below!). Release Notes:Updated Miner Software to latestUpdated Bitcoin Core to latestAdded NVME SSD format option in settings (only use if your formatting a newly installed SSD, or if your Node will not start up/drive is corrupted)Added Bitcoin Core version number in Node sectionAdded swap service directly to API for dynamic ram requirements for upcoming native BTC appsFixed issue that would cause connected standard units to not restart mining after internet outageFixed issue that would cause dashboard to not display stats if system timezone is changedMany other stability and big fixesThe update will take 5-15 minutes so please do not refresh your web UI or restart/shutdown the Apollo until the web dashboard has refreshed. The miner should automatically start and dashboard refresh to latest version after update is complete. If you are having issues with the update or not seeing changes, rebooting your Apollo and closing your Web UI window and starting a new one (if you are accessing remotely) should resolve most issues.\n",

Last night I wrote to Futurebit support and they replied that most likely my Apollo BTC Miner goes into temperature overheating and therefore to deactivate the mining process until the node is fully synchronized. Probably the mining process together with the download of the blockchain and the synchronization of the node in addition to an environment that is not cold but at ambient temperature (about 21 C) overheats our Apollo BTC too much and disconnects from the network to avoid damage from temperature or operation . In fact, when this happens I turn off the miner for about ten minutes and when I turn it back on the IP reappears and I can access it from the web dashboard. Now I have turned off the mining process and I am only synchronizing the node (I have reached 98%) when everything is synchronized I will start the mining process and see the results.

      "Ok I can finally say that I have solved the problem and I am very happy !!! The crux of the matter was because it frequently disconnected from the router or network and went into lockdown, the IP address disappeared and I could no longer log in via the web dashboard. From a recent email from Futurebit support they advised me to first finish the synchronization of the node and blockchain download, and then start the mining process.My Apollo Full Node has been continuously undermining for 3 days without network interruptions or overheating problems and therefore disconnections. I am very happy with this and have found the solution thanks to Futurebit support.So I recommend to those who have problems similar to this, first to terminate the synchronization process of the entire blockchain and deactivate the mining process by holding Apollo Full Node in a not too hot environment and then when the node has finished synchronizing all the blockchain start the mining process.Happy mining to all guys...\n",

      "I know this post is a couple months old, but in case the OP is still needing this (or others who might be looking to do the same), I was able to get my full-node unit mining my own node. I didn't do a 'write-up' of this, and it does require some basic / intermediate Linux knowledge, but in a nutshell:I installed ckpool - source package found here (they don't supply pre-built binaries): (<link> and set up a simple pool in standalone mode (without ckdb support), with my local full node (127.0.0.1:8332) as the btcd, and 127.0.0.1:3333 as the address for miners to connect. Once I got bitcoin.conf (from the node) and ckpool.conf (from ckpool) set up so that everything was working as expected, I modified the script that starts up the node, to also start up the ckpool process.Someone else may know a solution to this problem, but I had to replace the bitcoind binary with an earlier version 0.19.1 - this is because version 0.20.0 and later which removed the coinbaseaux flag from the GBT response, and ckpool doesn't play nice without it there (even though it isn't a required flag ...).Then in the ApolloUI, I set up my pool as: <truncated> - User and pass: <same as rpcuser and rpcpassword from <truncated> comes up on its own when I (re)start the device -- and if you don't change the RPC username / pass from the defaults, it also remains fully integrated with the UI, though obviously you don't see anything about ckpool (since the node_start script modification I made launches ckpool in a screen session (screen -dmS ckpool), like the node and miner services do, I can pull up the running ckpool output via (as root): screen -x ckpool). If you do change the rpcuser and rpcpassword from default, it breaks the UI - but at some point I'll probably take the time to figure out how to change the values the UI uses to connect so that I can change the RPC <truncated> of results:<link> : this unit has always had ~40% hardware errors since I first started it up 12/27, regardless which mining pool I used (tried ckpool, nicehash, slush, etc).

Once more services and apps are part of the system the RPC credentials will be tied to the user password that is set during setup.HW error issue is not a concern, very small number of units will have this issue and its because 1 or 2 bad cores out of thousands of cores that are any our Apollo are constantly spitting back bad data. The way our system is designed its hard to filter out \"real\" HW errors due to low voltage/overheating on the cores from \"bad\" HW errors due to bad cores.

All other comments/general questions go to the anouncment thread: <link> StartedThis post is for the Full Package/Node version, while it is geared for new users its still recommended you read the whole post as there is important information that pertains to how our system works.If you are looking for software for your USB Standard Version to run on your own system see post below:<link> you are looking for the Apollo BTC Image for your SD card (to re-flash to stock state etc) you can find that below:<link> are the quick getting started instructions that you should have also received inside your Apollo, with more details and an FAQ section at the end. This thread is a great resource for additional questions, and is always monitored so if you have additional questions that are not covered below please feel free to post. Carefully remove the Apollo BTC, Power Supply, and AC Power Cable from the box. Be sure not to touch any PCB components on the exposed bottom of the unitTurn the ASIC miner over so the blue micro-controller is exposed. Make sure the white Micro SD card, as well as the M.2 SSD are both firmly in their sockets and did not become loose during shipment Plug in your HDMI Monitor cable to the side HDMI port on your Apollo, and a USB Keyboard/Mouse to the USB ports in the back of the Apollo. If you are not using wifi, plug in your network ethernet cable to the ethernet port on the back of the unit (note you can setup your Apollo over ethernet without a <truncated> if you wish, see instructions below). Plug the supplied AC power cable into the APU-200W Power supply, and the other end into your AC socket (please note the power cable is for NA markets, the power supply works in all markets (120 and 240v), but you will need an adapter or your own AC cable). Plug in the two 6 Pin PCIE output cables into both power ports of the Apollo. Make sure the 6 Pin connectors are firmly plugged into the Apollo, the cable will overheat if it does not have good contact.WARNING: Always make sure both PCIE plugs are plugged into the Apollo, even if you are using your own PSUNEVER Plug in two separate power supplies into the same Apollo THIS IS A FIRE HAZARDIf you ordered Standard Units, repeat the steps above, and plug in the supplied Micro USB cable to the back Micro USB Port of the Standard Apollo and the other end into the USB port of the Full Package Apollo (you can use any standard USB hub if you run out of USB ports).Switch on your power supply on all the Apollo units, and wait for the Full Package Apollo to boot.

This is because of two main reasons:1) Due to the low relative hash-rate of the Apollo, and the high difficulty of Bitcoin it can take a very long time to receive a minimum payout on some pools, especially if you want to avoid paying a \"payout fee.\" Do your research on each pool and what their minimum payout is and their fees. Once you commit to a pool you will be tied there for up to several months until you get your payout, its its extremely important your committed to that pool before you start mining. While some pools can pay out smaller amounts to their own side chains/internal wallets you have to DYOR on whether this is right for you2) Bitcoin Pools are very centralized and a lot of hash power directed at these pools are from large mines/cooperations with a large portion in China. While the individual hash-rate of your Apollo might not seem like much, the collective hash power of all FutureBit Apollos could have a significant impact....you are voting on what kind of network you want Bitcoin to turn into when you point your hash power somewhere, and that usually boils down to what the particular pool supports. While we dont want to play sides on where our users choose to point their hash power, we think slush pool is a good first choice. They have a great user interface, relatively low hash-rate, are based in Europe (and outside of China which is important), and are developing Startum V2 protocol which we intend to support and further help decentralizing pooled mining. Once you have chosen a pool, go to its help section (for example on slush pool its at <link> You need to figure out the mining URL and port for your region, your username if its an account based pool or a wallet address your mined bitcoin will be deposited to if its wallet based, and password (usually can be anything, but some pools use this for options). You can enter this information the first time you visit the Apollo dashboard, or by selecting the pool settings on the left navigation menu. In the URL field you have to enter both the pool URL as well as the port (ie <truncated> If you do not enter the port the dashboard will not let you save the pool information. You do not need to enter stratum+tcp:// before the pool URL. In the username field follow the instructions your pool gave you for your username (its usually the account or worker name you setup with the pool, or a BTC address). These are sometimes case sensitive, and the Apollo will not connect to the pool if it is not correctIn the password field just enter any value if the pool does not require it, or whatever password you setup with the pool/worker (sometimes this is NOT the same as your account pool password). This field is also sometimes used for more advanced pool settings3) For users wanting to play the lottery with their Apollo (ie solo mine), we are working on direct solo-mining support to your full node on the device itself. For the time being you can use a good solo pool like <link> Settings/TuningThe Apollo BTC comes pre-tuned with three main modes, and these modes should be more than enough for most users. The Apollo-Miner firmware already has built in per chip tuning so unless you are an expert user that really wants to push the hardware on the extreme efficiency or performance side you probably dont need to touch the custom settings. Under the Settings side panel you will find the three different modes you can toggle. Your Apollo is shipped and starts mining in ECO modeECO: This is the most efficient, quiet, and low power mode. Your Apollo will mine at about 2TH/s in this mode and consume about 120 Watts. The fan should be barely audible in this mode. BALANCED: This mode provides a good balance between power, efficiency and noise. Your Apollo will mine at about 2.5TH/s in this mode and consume about 160 Watts. The fan will be slightly louder in this mode, but should still be quiet in a normal setting.TURBO: This mode provides the highest hash rate capable with the FutureBit APU-200 PSU. Your Apollo will mine at about 3TH/s in this mode and consume about 200 Watts. The fan will be loud in this mode.Custom SettingsFull Node InfoThe Apollo Full Node runs the latest release binaries from bitcoincore.org, and is automatically configured and setup at the system level. It will start syncing a clean chain state from block 0 on your nvme SSD on first boot, and is capable of downloading a full unpruned node on its 500 GB drive with a 1-2 year buffer. This is the core that will enable us to release additional apps and services in the coming months and years (solo mining, block explorer, Lightning network all planned in the short term), and allow you the user to verify your own transactions and chain state without needing to trust anyone else. These updates will be issues directly through the dashboard, and you will see a yellow \"Update\" button once we start releasing additional functionality. Few things to keep in mind:While our SBC is extremely powerful for its size, the initial chain state download will stress all 6 of its cores to the max for several days while your node syncs. Its not recommend to run your hashboard past the ECO setting while the node syncs, as this can overheat the CPU and cause it to shutdown. If your in a warmer environment its recommend to stop the miner until the node fully syncs (24-48 hours). Do NOT hard shutdown your system while the node is running (ie press the off button on your power supply). You should always shutdown your system via the shutdown menu in the Apollo Dashboard, or via the Desktop. This will ensure your node saves the chain state properly and does not corrupt the node, or your SD cardThe node should automatically configure your router to open port 8333 via UPnP, and you should see more than 8 connections in your dashboard. If it stays on 8, this means you need to manually open the port to your Apollos IP address in your router port forwarding rules. This will help count your node as a public node, help other nodes sync, and further decentralize the Bitcoin network. All blockchain data is stored on the NVME drive which is located at /media/nvme on the linux system. It is also accessible on the desktop via the file browser. If you want to download the Bitcoin Core wallet (which is not installed by default for obvious reasons) you need to first shutdown the node via the dashboard menu FIRST, then startup Bitcoin Core UI. The Bitcoin core wallet can not run/share the blockchain data at the same time as the node is running. If you are setting up the wallet for the first time, make sure you select /media/nvme/Bitcoin as the default folder otherwise it will start to download the blockchain on your SD card which will cause you lots of headaches (will fix this with symlinks in an update)FUTUREBIT IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST WALLETS OR DATA/BITCOIN ON YOUR APOLLOAs always, its recommended to store your Bitcoin on a hardware wallet/seed capable wallet where you have your seed backed up. Since the Apollo is a essentially a full desktop computer you can download any third party wallet software you wish, and use almost all USB/Bluetooth hardware wallets Never store wallet data/sensitive information on the SD card your system resides on. Treat the NVME drive as your permanent storage solution (ie third party wallets/apps make sure your wallet info is store in the /media/nvme directory and NOT a default location in the system. If your SD card becomes corrupted/unsusable (which is very common with SD cards), you will need to reflash your SD card which means any information stored on it will be lost. The NVME drive on the other hand is a much more robust storage solution, and any information you have saved on it will be accessible even if you have to wipe your SD cardTell all your Bitcoin friends your miner runs a full node, and you now have a device that embodies one of the purest versions of satoshi's original vision. (ie something that has not occurred since the original bitcoin core release when EVERYONE mined, ran a full node, and wallet on the same CPU!) FutureBit OS/SystemDO NOT perform a distribution update to 22.04, only regular and security update are supported. You will need to reflash your SD card if you perform this update as its not supported. The FutureBit Apollo BTC with its modern 6 core ARM processor and 4 GB of RAM allows it to run a full desktop environment. It runs a flavor of the latest Ubuntu 20.04 operating system with 5.10 linux kernel. You can run almost any Linux based application and use it as a full desktop/web browser system. Most Monitors, Keyboards/Mouse, and bluetooth accessories will work with the system, but support is limited beyond the basics. Dont expect high resolution / odd sized monitors to work, or drivers for all USB devices to be available. We chose the Ubuntu Desktop environment since it is a familiar and easy to use desktop even if you have never used linux.

      "DO NOT perform a distribution update to 22.04, only regular and security update are supported. You will need to reflash your SD card if you perform this update as its not supported.Known IssuesUsing a special character ($%&@ etc) in your dashboard password during initial setup could cause the futurebit system password to not be updated correctly, only user an alphanumeric password for your dashboard until this is fixedAfter updating your web UI or first boot on a new system/flash you might see an error on the node dashboard after setup. Simply restart the node (stop/start in the menu) or a reboot will fix this issueFAQQ: I updated the system and now my Apollo won't boot or shows command line text on the screenA: Please flash your SD card to the latest image. Older version of our image has an issue where you could not update the underlying OS through the OS updater and would cause the system to brick. This has been fixed in the latest image releases (please note only regular and security updates are supported do NOT do a distro upgrade to 22.04 otherwise this will brick your system as well). Q: My Apollo freezes or is unresponsive when its syncing the node A: When you first start up your Apollo the node syncs from scratch, and needs to download and process the whole ~500GB blockchain. This is very CPU and system intensive, and during this initial sync that can take up to 48 hours your system can be sluggish and/or can even overheat/freeze if your running it in a warm environment. Its recommended to stop the miner during this initial sync (or not run it past ECO mode), and turn the miner back on after the node has fully synced. Q: My node dashboard keeps telling me to port forward 8333A: Your node will keep saying this until it has fully synced. Since no inbound connections will happen while your node is syncing, you will have to wait for your node to fully sync before it can start participating in the networking and helping out other nodes. If this message still occurs after your node has synced, then you need to manually port forward 8333 to your Apollo's IP address. Please contact your router support on how to do this. Q: The miner dashboard shows offline, or keeps going offline when when I restart itA: Either your device does not have a proper internet connection, or your pool url and credentials are incorrect. Do NOT include the stratum+tcp:// part in the url, and make sure your username and password are correct, they are case sensitive in some pools. If you did not setup a password with your pool worker, do not leave the password field blank, put in something random (ie 1, x, etc). Q: I have a full package unit and one or more standard units. Some Standard units show 0 hashrate or dont start hashing right awayA: USB Driver is a bit finicky for the USB controller on the hashboard. It can take several minutes for the controller to establish a good connection to the Standard unit and start hashing, so please wait 10-15 minutes and it should start up on its own. If you keep pressing restart the software won't have time to properly start up the hashboards. Q: I dont see any video on my HDMI monitorA: Your monitor needs to be powered on and HDMI plugged into your Apollo BEFORE powering on your Apollo. The Apollo will not recognize your monitor if its powered on before the monitor or HDMI cable is plugged in. If this does not work double check your input on the monitor is in the correct HDMI port. Please be aware that not all monitors will work with the Apollo (odd sized monitors, really high resolution tvs etc).\n",

      "Installing a water cooling kit can greatly reduce the noise, prolong the life of the chip and additional to that it can improve the miner's performance.The noise is reduced because you dont need these high-speed fans, which are required for air cooling, any longer. As I mentioned above: By using water cooling, the temperature will drop significantly which also has a positive influence on the power consumption of the hashboard.Make sure that you choose the right kit if you are going to buy a kit. There are a few differences between the S19 models.\n",

      "Hi,I am new to mining, and am about to get towards the end of the month a new Antminer S19 95TH, so, as I have some time to prepare/plan, I was wondering if I could get some advice on how to set it up:- I was told that I need a separate line of 220V, however I was thinking to get a step-up trafo from 110 to 220V having 5000W. Is this OK?- I understood that the antminer comes w/o any power cables, so I have to get 2 power cables (similar like those for PCs) from what I could see on its picture, correct?- what software do I need in order to have it mine properly?- in order to configure it, is it possible to connect it to a monitor and a keyboard?- I saw on a tutorial video that the miner needs 2 cables, so would I also need a UPS to plug those cables?- as sometimes most of tutorial videos are pretty old regarding pools, and software used, is it possible to get a link towards a more recent video?- do I need a cold wallet? I have right now 2 wallets on Crypto and Shakepay, however I understood that more securely would be a cold wallet, so which one would be a good one to use?I am going to consult also this forum and see what I can find as information.Thank you\n",

      "Greetings to all bitcoin fans!I have something interesting for you today!We have been working on Bitcoin Asics based heating systems for a while now and now I think we have something to share with you!The first thing I would like to mention is that we are staunch supporters of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies! Many call cryptocurrencies on POW unecological, destructive to the economy, for this reason many states ban mining, and cryptocurrencies in general. But we can't give up on POW, if only because bitcoin is based on POW! After connecting asics for mining instead of heating devices that use electricity, in this case no one can say that Bitcoin is not environmentally friendly. In terms of economic benefits, this direction also promises great prospects, because if we install bitcoin heating systems on objects that consume electricity for heating, we can conditionally assume that the cost of electricity for mining is zero, that is free. Our mission is to popularize the use of asics in heating systems and make it technically possible.What we realized is that at the moment there are very few offers on the market that allow you to use asics for heating and heating systems in most of the available objects. Yes, there are many offers on Chinese marketplaces for conversion to liquid cooling, as well as hydro asics from the well-known Antminer, Whatsminer, but it is not suitable for heating in widespread use. Many technical problems arise during the actual connection, they are mainly related to the hydraulic part, it due to small internal dimensions can quickly clog, collapse under the influence of pressure or electrolysis, may not pass enough liquid that leads to overheating. All this requires the addition of intermediate devices - heat exchangers, special heat transfer fluids, pumps, and other equipment, and all this becomes too complex and expensive to become a reality. Therefore, we have developed and established the production of special heat exchangers for asics, which we call water blocks. Thanks to bimetallic construction and special technology of water blocks production we have achieved the following results:- now we can connect the asic to any hydraulic system directly, we do not care what coolant is used, the stainless tube is not subject to corrosion and electrolysis processes. - We also have a huge internal size for the flow of the coolant, which also corresponds to the standard of half inch, and can be connected to any pipeline- we have a fully monolithic, one-piece water block that can withstand any pressure possible in heating systems, we don't have to worry about the hash board being damaged.- We can connect the asics directly to swimming pools, we don't have to worry about the water block breaking down from corrosion and electrolysis, as it happens with water blocks that are made of 100% aluminum.- our units can be made 95% using recycled materials, which can bring additional savings and tax advantages in some cases. - we can say with certainty about high reliability of the hydraulic part, expected service life is more than 50 years, stainless steel is not subject to corrosion and chemical attack.Example of water block for Watsminer M 30 C model<link>Thanks to special water blocks, as well as properly selected software, and other solutions, we can confidently say that it is now possible to implement asics on most objects that need heating, and we can maintain the temperature of the coolant from 30 to 70 degrees. But the most preferred temperatures are 30-50 degrees. In our opinion this brings the general acceptance of bitcoin closer to the general acceptance of bitcoin worldwide and makes bitcoin more environmentally friendly.At the moment we can connect such asics to any heating systems:All air-cooled Whatsminer modelsAll air-cooled Antminer models.We can also install our waterblocks on liquid cooled models such as Antminer S19 Hydro, Whatsminer M53 and othersI wouldn't want to give a lot of information in one post, so if the topic attracts attention, I can talk about technical details and answer questions.\n",
