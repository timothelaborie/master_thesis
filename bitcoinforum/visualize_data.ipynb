      "our ASIC miner hardware is suffering a very big BUG,here it isOur mcu environment is cortex-m3, os is rt thread, tcp / ip protocol stack is lwip.The reason of the problem: lwip connect/close cause memory leaks, which makes MCU crashed about every 60 seconds.So the mining performance can not match the hardware. The efficiency is lower than we expected.our ideas:1 fix the lwip's memory leak when connect/close socket, solve the reset problem .2 reduces the times of connect / close socket , you need to change the stratum proxy side, get more works at one time.mcu side: need to initiate a request to the stratum proxy side, and the work number could be configured.stratum proxy side: needs to acknowledge the request from mcu side and find out how many works need to be transfer to mcu and then transfer them.For example, There could be a \"getwork2\" which has many \"getwork\" implemented in it.So, once mcu client has a request (e.g. 10 works), then stratum could transfer 10 works to mcu by only one connetion transaction, rather than 10 times <truncated> we need to same time so much, we prefer the idea 2) very much,thank you for your time and if you think you can help us to code&achieve it,plz msg me.\n",

Just because something is perceived to be \"slow\" (in this case) is NOT a good reason to try and do a manual upgrade on a system. We do quite a bit of QA and testing prior to putting out a release as well, however we are also human and do not catch everything possible. We aim for the best case scenario which is a stable and working version of StarMiner.As noted previously, we are aware of the \"slowness\" with the webUI. However, the miner application runs properly and at full capacity which is the more important aspect. Any webUI in general is in the end \"eye candy\" and a layer on top of the actual mining application itself. Granted, the webUI is meant to make things \"easier\" for the end user, yes.\n",

It will generally start at USB0 and increment by one from there, so just add as many as you have devices.

      "For clarification purposes, StarMiner is not a \"ROM\" nor \"firmware\" (both terms have been commonly misused by both hardware manufacturers and community members). This is an \"image file\" that is parallel (for example) to one installing Linux on a Raspberry Pi. We just simplified the process by making sure that this image runs both Gridseed and Zeus Miner ASIC units, and eventually Scriptor 8X FPGA units. To answer your questions in order:StarMiner does not use a GUI \"per se\" from the Raspberry Pi itself. There is a webUI which is accessible by going to a web browser (e.g., Firefox, Chrome, IE (yuk!), Safari) and going to the IP address of the StarMiner Raspberry Pi. This is \"our GUI\" and is focused on the specific aspects of ASIC mining for the \"end user\" without \"extras\" that could get any \"curious George\" type end user into trouble. WiFi can work on the Raspberry Pi via the command line and using wicd-curses. However, not all USB wifi dongles will work with a Raspberry Pi. Please refer to this site for more specifics related to \"Raspberry Pi friendly\" Wifi devices.StarMiner \"could\", however and to prevent people from damaging their Gridseed Mini and Blade units, we compiled and configured cgminer for \"scrypt only\". Looking at the \"operation costs\", you are actually wasting power trying to \"dual mine\" with a Gridseed Mini ASIC versus just scrypt mine with it.By the \"Gridseed 5 chips (orb)\", if you mean the \"Gridseed Mini\" (as it is commonly referred to), then yes. There is also more information and further discussions on our LitecoinTalk forum thread for further review, as well as our SourceForge site under Wiki and Discussion, both of which are \"work in progress\".Let us know if you have any further questions.

      "For any WiFi device, one still needs to configure it properly unless you really want to run all of your network traffic via wifi unencrypted and \"open\", thus vulnerable. Using the command line (thus, logging into StarMiner via SSH or via the console by plugging the Raspberry Pi into a monitor and keyboard), this is done via wicd-curses. It is not \"sexy\" as a GUI, but it does the job it is designed to do in a TUI (Text User Interface) style just as well. For reference, I am part of the developer team, as well as the Owner of Linux ETC. StarMiner is my original concept and thus, it is \"my baby\" as a project here as well. StarMiner came to be due to the lack of proper controllers that \"looked pretty and sexy\", but were \"not up to snuff\" mining functionality wise. Reminds me of buying a car...always look \"under the hood\", not just at the body. Yes, \"time is money\". Most of us in the mining circles know and understand this as well (myself included here). However, this is also a Raspberry Pi which is just a minimal/basic ARM CPU and 512MB of RAM, not like perhaps your video editing workstation on Apple's Mac hardware with 16GB+ of RAM and an Intel i7 CPU (as a polite guess ). Having a GUI run on top of (1) a mining application like cgminer or bfgminer; and (2) Apache web server running Perl scripts will overload a Raspberry Pi to make it operate under an extremely and excessively high load (i.e., you are moving at \"snail's pace\"). The webUI is meant to resolve some of the \"plug and play/miner\" needs of basic users in place of using a GUI. So, when you refer to \"time is money\", having a miner that runs as \"snail's pace\" also fits in this situation. We are aware of such, and designed StarMiner to avoid running as \"snail's pace\" and thus be more effective and efficient as a mining controller tool.So while I admit, StarMiner may not make everyone happy (as you so noted above) by not having a GUI interface, the reason, sound logic, and engineering behind such is noted. Most would prefer knowing that StarMiner can and does mine with their particular ASIC device (we have a growing list on our SourceForge Discussion section) in full and efficiently versus \"where is my pretty GUI\" that will overload a simple Raspberry Pi.\n",

      "This post is in reference to a StarMiner SourceForge Ticket made recently.There is publicly known an issue in general with Raspberry Pi model B units that have stamped on the board itself Made in China (versus the Made in the UK versions). We (Linux ETC) have experienced this issue first hand as well. If one were to Google such, you will find a list of various complaints and griefs about this. The \"short version\" is that quite often, the Made in China Raspberry Pi units are poorly fabricated when compared to the Made in the UK versions. This is why Raspberry Pi (the company and .org itself) decided to move a majority of their production to the Sony UK facility. There are still \"some\" Raspberry Pi's made in China (allegedly for the \"far east market\"), and I am not saying that all Raspberry Pi units from China \"are bad\" here, nor all from the UK \"are good\" either. It seems though the reason for the move (besides RaspberryPi.org is based in the UK ) is for better quality and overall control of the manufacturing process.So when you first boot up StarMiner on a Raspberry Pi, and things start going wrong with your network, do not blame StarMiner on it right off please. StarMiner is a bit more \"process and resource\" intensive that a majority of images and applications that can run on a Raspberry Pi, yes. However, out of nearly 300 downloads since StarMiner's initial release on 20 April 2014, and this is the only reported instance of \"gremlins in mix\", I think I will trust the logic and stats that 1 out of ~300 that StarMiner is not the cause nor fault here. Now potentially a faulty Raspberry Pi with a bad NIC (Network Interface Controller) in this particular case does seem to fit the bill as potentially the cause.\n",

There are even a few screen shots as well, including one \"groupie\" who was able to successfully mix both Gridseed Blade units with Gridseed Mini units (it is recommended to NOT attempt this with Zeus Miner ASIC units at this time!). Feel free to advise on any issues you may encounter, as well as share your experience in using StarMiner as well.

      "Good to hear! If you want to share a screen shot after you run your StarMiner + Gridseed Blade units for a while, I am sure others would love to see the results. Our LitecoinTalk forum thread actually has quite a few from the \"StarMiner groupies\" showing and sharing their successes as well.Now a simple explanation about StarMiner and the initial configuration files and profiles being used. These files are meant to be \"basic\" and \"simple\" so that one can run startest from the command line to verify StarMiner with your Gridseed or Zeus Miner ASIC or Scriptor FPGA \"does work\". The configuration files with startest will work in full with the \"basic model\" of the ASIC hardware (e.g., a Gridseed \"Mini\" or a Zeus Miner \"Blizzard\"), but are not expected to be show \"optimal\" for the other ASIC nor run long term for efficient and effective mining performance. So then, one needs to select the proper hardware profile from the webUI and adjust accordingly (e.g., \"gs-blade\" for your specific case) using stared on the command line or from the webUI editor page to have \"optimal\" performance for the most part (yes, occasionally some minor adjustments might be needed ). By \"basic\" (with respect to Gridseed ASIC units) this is with a clock speed of 850MHz and a single unit. One can adjust these by adding the parameters for the chip count, and even specific ASIC clock frequencies by the serial number if such is desired. Do note, the \"serial number\" aspect is Gridseed units specific only as Zeus Miner did not include such an option with their ASIC hardware (i.e., all Zeus Miner ASIC units would have to use the same clock frequency \"across the board\" here).Also to note, the \"StarMiner crew\" for the majority are located in the US Mountain Time zone (UTC/GMT-7). Please keep this in mind when posting or sending messages since contrary to popular belief, most of us are not \"glued to the computer 24 hours a day\", and do have other obligations in life. We do our best though to respond to postings and inquiries as quickly as possible though. Congrats once again on getting StarMiner up and running on your Gridseed Blades!

      "From a quick review of Rock Miner's Github repository, it appears that Rock Miner ASIC units are using cgminer with a modified version of the Icarus driver/module. The Icarus driver/module is more of a \"generic FPGA\" driver/module, thus it is not specific typically for one particular ASIC or FPGA unit. This is what was initially released with Zeus Miner's ASIC unit (though we developed a \"better driver/module\" accordingly ) and also explains why some of the Zeus Miner ASIC units were not performing up to specification. Without having some Rock Miner ASIC units \"in hand\", we (the \"StarMiner crew\") cannot say how their version of cgminer may or may not work of course.

What one needs to consider (which is noted on our LitecoinTalk.org forum thread) is the actually accepted versus rejected share numbers. The Zeus Miner \"Blizzard\" units the \"StarMiner crew\" has for development purposes both show eventually a high number of hardware errors. To minimize this some requires adjust the clock frequency some (we have found that 342Mhz is typically \"acceptable\" for most Zeus Miner ASIC units; originally most were reporting 327Mhz was also a relatively \"acceptable\" frequency as well). However, the percentage of rejects is extremely low relatively speaking as well.

StarMiner for the majority of cases though was able to work well with these ASIC units that other mining applications and full images had issues with.

      "Hi everyone. I really like this program. Ever since this poclbm issue recently and the entire SDK2.6 problem, I'm running many of my rigs with the guiminer and diaphatk kernel. This is more an emergency measure though. I haven't been able to get aoclbf to run with diaphatk so far. I do not want to switch to CG miner, since my results with it were dissatisfying.I'd like to go back using aoclbf so I can have a backup pool option. Furthermore, is there a way to solo mine using aoclbf's backup function? The reason is following: I mined 7 blocks in 8 months at slush's pool and one block in one month at btcguild yet only got about 250 BTC paid out alltogether. This makes me wonder if it wouldn't be great to have a solo mining option. I will never catch up and who knows with decreasing btc prices, the difficulty might go down again another time.With diaphatk I got most of my performance back, but the 100%CPU bug is still there. It was kind of nice deciding whether to spare the cpu or go for full performance, but now with the additional pcoblm bug, I got confused. I do not want to spend another few weeks figuring out how to get things back up and running smoothly.So, quick recap:Which aoclbf is best to use with SDK2.6 (catalyst 11.2-12.1)?Should I use the old version of guiminer that is not affected by the recent bug?Which files do I copy exactly, and where?Thank you for your help!\n",

I think you can solomine the same way u do in phoenix just put in the local address instead of the pool address. but umm anywhoo...DUDE. it just dawned on me how to fix (temp.) the error. Is it possible to have AOCLBF exit and restart itself every 12 24 36 or 48 hrs like an extra setting that you could choose?

      "There are many great commercial apps and open source efforts on these forums for monitoring your mining rigs. I am going to present yet another dashboard showing hash rate and temperature for your Antminer (or any miner that supports cgminer api) with mobile support and alerts (email and text).It's a fun simple project for the DIY crowd that I put together on a slow Friday afternoon using a python script and an existing IOT platform called Cayenne.First, a live demo. <link> is updated once a minute.Source and readme are here: <link> sections of the readme are pasted below.Use uploadhash.py to upload hash rate and miner temps to mydevices.com Cayenne dashboard.This will make the miner stats available on mobile device or web interface where you can get alerts when your miner is in <truncated> Any computer that can run Python- A miner like the Antminer S9 that supports the cgminer <truncated> Make sure python is set up on your computer. If you have problems then make sure you install dependencies. Do a google search.- sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-openssl- sudo python setup.py install2. install mqtt lib. This is a client to communicate with mydevices.com Cayenne back end.- sudo pip install paho-mqtt3. Create your dashboard by signing up at <link> and following the prompts. If you have any issues with the mydevices.com or Cayenne setup then get help on their community forum. Add a device through their site to generate a user id, password id, and client id that you will use in step 5. This will allow you to authenticate to their back end.4. Download <link> it in any folder on your rpi and rename it <truncated> Make one small edit to the file. Comment out the following line by putting a # at the beginning of the line.#response = <truncated> reason is that we want the raw json string coming from the miner as output, not the python object.5. Put the file uploadhash.py in the same directory as minerapi.py and then customize with your settings.Edit the script uploadhash.py with the following info:- ip address of your miner- mydevices.com Cayenne user, password, and client id from step 2. IMPORTANT! You get this info from the Cayenne dashboard. These values are different than your login and password on that site. - modify the polling interval if you so choose.6. Now run the script, \"python uploadhash.py\". You can add the script as a cron task by using \"crontab -e\" and set it up to run @reboot. Google for instructions.If the script is running correctly then you will see the diagnostics output on the console with your miner stats, hashrate and temp. <truncated> $ python <truncated> 3 60 55 5913622.19 3 60 55 6013634.74 3 61 56 61...7. Check your Cayenne dashboard and configure your widgets. Don't forget to set up Cayenne Alerts from your dashboard to get notified when hashrate falls or temps rise.[EDIT:] Clarified that Raspberry Pi is not required. Will run on any computer.\n",

      "Thank you for the link to the security article.From the article: \"The critical point is that miners need username and password to log in.\"I recommend the following: - Do not expose your antminer to the internet. Always place it behind a firewall. In this way your miner will not be discovered by Shodan. - Always change the default user name and password for your miner (remember to change both web access and ssh access) - Monitor your mining payout address so if someone changes your pool and worker address you will notice.Having said that, the scripts in this thread have been replaced by Full Cycle Mining (I am the author of both). I do not yet recommend any of the programming be exposed to the internet because someone could easily switch pools or reset all your miners. The best rule for security right now is to always access miners using vpn.\n",

(Please correct me if I'm wrong.)I don't know a whole lot about Linux, but there are some Linux hardware monitors that may be helpful: <link> you get a good hardware monitor and --gpu-reorder alone isn't helpful, you can enable one GPU at a time in cgminer and watch the temperatures and clock speeds in the hardware monitor to determine which GPU is mining. Although this may only be helpful if the hardware monitor provides enough information to identify which physical GPU is which displayed GPU.As a last resort, you could enable one GPU at a time in cgminer and try to actually watch the fans on the GPUs to see which one is running at 100% (assuming you have cgminer set to control fan speed accordingly). I haven't tried this so I can't say for sure it will be possible, but I'm guessing with six GPUs you don't have them all mounted inside the case so you may be able to see or hear the one running at 100%.Perhaps using it with the information here: <link> would be helpful? Again, not a Linux user so I may not know what I'm talking about... but since nobody has replied yet I figured I'd try to help.\n",

      "Is this on GPU or FPGA?The red light just flashes when your hashrate goes more than 10% above the hashrate expected from the particular device. Nothing to worry about (except burning out the GPU if you overclock too much).It's usually one of two things causing this problem.Upgrading Java, at least from version 6 to version 7, sometimes breaks something and you need to clear out the java temporary files. The next time you start the app after that it will download everything anew and it works. How to clear java temporary files: <link> other frequent cause of this is antivirus software. Sometimes they like to inspect file transfers. Sometimes they do that and accidentally break file transfers so that Java web start isn't able to finish downloading the files. I think this is usually AVG antivirus. But it may be that other antivirus programs can do this too. Try whitelisting the javaws.exe program or turning off file transfer inspection. Consider the security implications of what solution you use. Turning antivirus completely off on a Windows computer is not recommended.\n",

      "I have a 7970 but this should work on yours too. Using afterburner make a custom fan profile which is more aggressive than stock to keep temps below what you want. My profile keeps my card 73-74c w/ 59% fan mining full time; If it goes above 77c the fan exponentially increases power until at 84C it is 100%. This negates the possibility of overheating to a large extent.Then lower your RAM clock to minimum and raise your chip clock in increments(I did 50MHz increments but use your judgement) until you get screen artifacts. I use a benchmarking tool to put heavy load on it but mining should do it as well after some time. Then I lowered my clock by 25 MHz. Gives me about 640 MH/s on my 7970 @ 1100 MHz. I also reduced power limit by 20% without any throttling but did not screw with core voltage as I was happy with the resultHere is a thread I found on OCed 5850's<link>\n",

Started them all up, and they are happily mining away in harmony.My only problem now is that it seems Bitminter is under DDOS attack. Darn.\n",

      "Running out of work can happen if the server is slow or the network between you and the server is slow or down. At one point today there was 20% packetloss, probably due to a problem at the data center, which would cause such a slowdown. This should not happen often.The message about not getting any results happens if the device was given lots of work but found no results. It may be that the work it was given simply didn't contain any valid proofs of work for it to find. But it can also be that the device has failed for some reason. Because the Icarus protocol is very primitive, it's impossible for your computer to tell the difference. So it sends the device some data it knows that it will respond to, and looks for that response. If there is no response even then, that means there is something wrong.\n",

      "The hub being the problem would be my guess. Each USB erupter draws 510mA, assuming you have the newer ones. Typical 10-port hubs only ship with a 4A power supply, which would limit them to 7 erupters. Some can take up to 500mA from the host, but some hosts can't supply that and even if your can, that only gets up up to 8. Many 7-port hubs have a 3A power supply, which will get you 5 erupters. If removing erupters makes it work stably, it's likely the hub or power supply.If you have a PC power supply handy, it can probably supply 5A at +5V off any of its power connectors without a problem. You can splice that to your USB hub's power cable.\n",

      "NEW VERSION 2.6.4, AUGUST 11 2012Human readable changelog:More drastic improvements to ModMiner clock adjustment algorithm. Downclocking should be more conservative, and BFGMiner will even raise the clock speed when it's doing well.ModMiners are now kept busier (less idle time) and nonces are checked against the previous work to catch races. This may result in a higher utility (effective hashrate).Tested and fixed problems managing throttling BitFORCE Singles. An 880 MH/s Single that was throttling to 440 MH/s before (and throwing lots of garbled errors) is now working cleanly at 590 MH/s - a 34% improvement in hashrate!A bunch of annoying crashes were fixed:With high-share devices when network connectivity is lost.GPU mining not functional when any OpenCL platform fails.Occasional deadlock/hang during exit.New --debuglog option to include debug information in log file (see README) but not in main console.The scrypt code was updated - now ALL results from a GPU are checked to see if they're valid and if not, instead of being submitted where they are guaranteed to be rejected, they register as hardware errors. This will make tuning your scrypt parameters easier as HW error count will rise if you've set the parameters too high.Updated miner.php from KanoFull changelogBugfix: Define <truncated> in miner.hEscape \" and \\ when writing json config fileminer.php allow a custom page section to select all fields with '*' - e.g. to create a STATS section on a custom pageminer.php optional single rig totals (on by default)Bugfix: Initialize submitting mutexBugfix: bitforce: Allocate enough space for FTDI description pointersQueue one request for each staged request removed, keeping the staged request count optimal at all times.Bugfix: Avoid cancelling threads while locks are heldSet recognizable names on threads for debuggingBugfix: Don't keep making new get_work threads if all pools are deadEnable configuring submission thread limit with --submit-threads optionBugfix: Limit active submission threads to 0x40 so we don't overflowBugfix: Properly handle switching to pools that aren't on the latest block, and warn if a pool actively switches to an old blockLog more details of reasons in stale_work debug messagesFailsafe against stale-on-arrival work: disable the poolBugfix: Debug message should show \"Work stale due to work restart\" when it's not a sharewindows-build: Remove APP SDK section since it is no longer neededmodminer: HACK: Let last_work handle the end of the work, and start the next one immediatelyBugfix: modminer: Remove erroneous \"else\" statement, to fix hashrate reportingREADME: Document user group required for FPGAs on Gentoo and <truncated> README adjustmentsBugfix: opencl: Ignore error getting device ids from platforms unless they are explicitly chosenNew --debuglog option to include debug info in stderr logfile even if not in the consoleBumped down debhelper compatibility reqs so that this will build on Lucid.Updated to match packaging changes.Switched to native packages so we don't have to muck around creating fake upstream tarballs, and can easily generate minor versions for upload to Launchpad.Removed accidentally included debugging line.Minor version bump again because of launchpad. Will sort this out for next release.Updated to patch bitforce module issue on Debian/Ubuntu.Added local quilt config dir to ignore.modminer: Check nonce against previous work, in case of raceBugfix: Enable --kernel-path option if ModMiner or Ztex is enabled (even if no OpenCL)Bugfix: Escape backslashes and double-quotes in strings that rightfully may have them, when writing JSON config fileClean object (.o) and dependency (.d) files out of source treeBugfix: bitforce: Don't count hashes that never happened due to throttlingBugfix: Deal with serial_open timeout maximum (25.5s)fpgautils: Linux only supports uint8_t decisecond values for timeouts, so use uint8_t for timeout value; this gets smart compilers to throw warnings when overflowed in some casesbitforce: Reduce serial timeout to 25 seconds (was 30) and increase job long timeout to 25 seconds (was 15) to handle throttling gracefullymodminer: Add debug info to API extra device statsmodminer: Raise clock speed when there's only good nonces for a whilemodminer: Only print clock speed adjustments when they actually changemodminer: Increase tolerance for bad nonces to 2%modminer: Reset bad-nonce ratio measurement when the clock speed changesBugfix: bitforce: Include the correct device id in \"garbled response\" warningADL: Add attribution and disclaimer to interfacesCleaned out refs to AMD SDKs.Updated README about debian packaging, changelog with minor version bump to work around Launchpad reqs.Updated changelog with Ubuntu release specific version, needed to build for multiple releases. Also stripped out ADL SDK stuff in the build rules.Initial work to adjust debian packaging from cgminer. Should build correctly now with pbuilder/pdebuild, and include docs.Adapt miner code to free ADL structuresImport free ADL interfacesInclude scrypt.h in Makefile.Fix windows bitforce build.Convert the serial autodetect functions to use int instead of char to enumerate devices.Deuglify windows autodetect code for BFL.There is no point zeroing temperature in BFL if we fail to get a response, and we should register it as a HW error, suggesting throttling.Update SCRYPT README with information about HW errors.Use the scrypt CPU code to confirm results from OCL code, and mark failures as HW errors, making it easier to tune scrypt parameters.We may as well leave one curl still available per pool instead of reaping the last one.Display reaped debug message outside mutex lock to avoid recursive locking.api.c update API start message and include port numberminer.php ignore arg when readonlyminer.php allow pool inputs: delete, addpool, <truncated> Reopen on communication errorBugfix: Calculate hw err percent for the affected FPGA onlymake-release: Adapt to new autogen by using NOCONFIGURE var\n",

      "Hello all! Long-time lurker, first-poster here!. First of all, a small introduction: I've been interested in the cryptocurrency world since it began at around $50 a BTC (lol!) however, I never had the possibility to get any (country issues ) and now I'm living somewhere else and electricity is expensive so mining isn't an option. However, I do have a lot of development experience and a few friends who can mine, and they have been looking for an app that can keep their miner apps alive. Somehow, it seems that the processes sometimes crash (usually experimental/beta software?) and they need to reboot them every now and then.So, due to this need and one of my friend's suggestion to post it here (I do have a few debts to pay and I'm really short on money, this new place is expensive as heck and I can't move yet) I figured I could make a full-fledged app since it seems to be a common need. I'm not sure if this should be posted in here or in the altcoins forum, as I said I'm not a miner so I don't know if the BTC apps are stable. If mods consider this should be moved elsewhere, feel free to do so!Now without further ado, here's the github repo for the app I made (includes documentation and how to use!):<link> can download binary and source code versions from there!As a sidenote, I've been reading a lot lately that some scurvy rats have been including malware in their source code (which I highly disapprove, that's pretty low man...), however I'm being transparent and honest here. The code is around less than 300-lines long combined and it's written in C# so it's easy to read and figure out what it does.Basically, it checks every N seconds for a process .exe name and if it doesn't exist, it waits N seconds before it runs a specific .exe/.bat/etc. file (which hopefully starts the miner) again. I've noticed miner apps always have a .bat file which you run to start up the .exe with some parameters, so I think you'll be familiarized with the process as this app is made to be run the same way.I'm thinking I could improve this app and make a GUI or something, maybe to monitor more than one process and/or provide other advanced options, but I'd like to know if it's useful first, before I spend a lot of time working in something that might not have enough interest. If there's a lot of interest, I can make a Linux-version using the Mono framework, which is easy to install in any platform nowadays, even OSX (but, who mines with a mac? is that even profitable? lol )I'm not sure if I can post wallet addresses here, so if you want to donate and help me a bit, you can find them in the GitHub link.Thanks and happy mining!- DARKGuy\n",

It now uses the API to find the Ants, making it much quicker, more responsive, and allows scanning of whatever segment you enter. Note that it'll still wait up to 5 seconds for each address to respond, so you can do the math to figure out how long it will take based on how many Ants you have (or don't <truncated>\n",

I am not sure if I should ask for money for this because it took me30 mins to do it, but I might open an account for donations if you find it useful.If I get at least 3 people which need this, I will write the tool so it's easy to use and also keeps permanent changes.If there's more people which need this kind of solution, add what kind of features it should have, if you want to downgrade or justenable ssh at boot time.Shean\n",

You have nothing to fear from Bitmain, they are your opponent anyway, but losing the trust from the community is final.And do note some determined person might also reverse engineer your tool and release an open source solution based on it ANYWAY. Why lose your chance? Embrace Open Source and earn the reputation it brings.Of course Bitmain COULD learn from computer history (at least since the 80ies) and drop the stupidity already.

      "Hi,I've done some work on s15, opening ssh and overclocking it: <link> mod might work similarly, a video would be welcome to see that it's actually doing something.My suggestion is to keep this under control, small miners can open ssh with serial console easily if they need it badly, but it will be a pain for big mining facilities if this gets fixed in new hardware and firmware.Good luck with whatever you're trying to do, but make sure you're not releasing \"Just another fishing trojan\" and mean it when you say you want to do some good to the community.I somehow disagree with that. I though in the past that I will be helping the community by making a video on how to compile Bmminer because github docs from bitmain were unbiguous then after a short while, \"custom\" firmware were popping like mushrooms. Took the video down for a while but others started to repost the video cuz they saved it.Sometimes it's better not to mess with things because you might do more harm than the intended good.IMHO at least, other might disagree because they need such solution. I am part of the asicfreeware.io telegram chat where there's a bounty for opening s15.I actually been part of developing a solution to overclock s15, <link> done it, but too less people participated to the bounty and it does not make any sense to release it for free if people don't actually need it as it might be used in other harming ways in the future. I figure if people really needed such solution, would've donated at least $5 for seeing this project go together. The bounty is pretty much stuck and John and Scott put quite some work in promoting this stuff.So my giveaway for this is becareful what you wish for.\n",

And yes, they put the thing on github, somebody else would have figured it out anyway, what with the actual developers of cgminer around here and all.But ok, no one can predict the future, or how others will react. Even if you both decide to keep quiet, somebody else might do it (or Bitmain drop its attitude). The serial solution is not that different to the sdcard method, except saving you from soldering a socket if the controller lacks one. In both you have to be physically present to do it. What the people offering bounties is about doing it remotely, so they can fix their large mining farms they foolishly updated to 2019 firmware, or for the new models that come crippled already.Bitmain might even pull out a tivoization, ie. checksum the image in nand and refuse to boot otherwise.
