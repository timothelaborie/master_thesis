Topic: donatify.org - rewarding quality content with bitcoin-microtransactions
### Original post:
we are working on a new idea which will reward quality content on the web called donatify. this will be done by <truncated> and exclusively with BTCBTCBTC! our main point is that you wont have to deal with donation buttons anymore and all that pain. donatify will allocate your monthly donation amount - you once have to set up - according to your content usage. meaning your time your are spending on blogs etc. and we are dealing with the rest. not only you are give props to good content providers but you are working with us to spread the acceptance of bitcoins. because we will send content providers, who are not signed up yet with us, an invitation to accept a bitcoin wallet with their donation amount allocated to them the previous month by donatify users!so guys check out our idea on www.donatify.org and drop us some comments here what you are thinking about!!! thx. rob

Topic: PBOC orders closure of Bitcoin trading accounts
### Original post:
Don't know if it's more FUD or??The People's Bank of China (PBOC) ordered banks and third-party payment companies to close Bitcoin trading accounts before April 15, Caixin.com Thursday reported citing unnamed sources from the central bank.Full Article via ECNS.CN:<link>

### Reply 1:
i think that this is going to hurt bitcoin for a minute but once china figures out what the hell they want to do price is going to be back over 1,000 and will countinue to grow

### Reply 2:
China has a vested interest in seeing the world's reserve currency maintain what little value it still has. A threat to the USD is a threat to them. Bitcoin is probably the single biggest threat to the USD and therefore a threat to China. No one gives up power without a fight.

### Reply 1:
To be fair, the ""bitcoin maximalist"" title, mostly being used as a derogatory term by some of the hardcore Ethereum people, is being used on people really really broadly. Heck, I was called a ""BiTcOiN mAxiMaLiSt"" by a decently followed Ethereum shill just because I stated somewhere that I only held bitcoin, even though I openly stated that I'm really open to other altcoin experiments.

### Reply 2:
After more than a year of being called that, I honestly still don't know if I should take it as a compliment or an insult. Mostly just me scratching my head in confusion.

Topic: BTCChina Clarification on Decision to Shut Down Exchanges
### Original post:
We've received several questions from customers following our announcement yesterday. We'd like to make the following clarifications: 1. BTCChina will completely shut down its exchange businesses on September 30th. 2. We made the decision to close our exchanges after considering this announcement published by Chinese regulators: <link> BTCC is a separate company from BTCChina. BTCC Pool, BTCC USD Exchange, BTCC DAX, BTCC Mobi, and BTCC Mint are not affected by this change. Please check out our BTCC products by visiting <link> and <link> BTCChina Exchange and BTCChina Blockchain+ have enough funds to accommodate all customer withdrawals, including CNY, BTC, LTC, BCC, and ETH.5. BTCChina encourages customers to withdraw their funds as quickly as possible. Customers can withdraw their funds whenever they want.6. BTCChina processes all withdrawals (including CNY, BTC, LTC, and ETH) within 24 hours.7. BTCChina customers will still be able to withdraw their funds after September 30. We will let customers know if there are any changes.8. BTCChina's Blockchain+ platform will open up BCC withdrawals before Sunday, September 24th.

### Reply 1:
Why would someone be so stupid to wait after 30 September and then withdraw his funds?It`s obvious that most of the users will withdraw their funds before 30 September.It`s sad that some bureaucrats will destroy all the chinese cryptocurrency exchanges and perhaps all the mining in China.Bitcoin and all the other altcoins will need a few months to recover from this ""disaster"".

### Reply 2:
I agree with you . We need to get the most accurate information from the Chinese community, if this really happens then surely the cryptocurrency market will have a lot of big losses and it will be very difficult to recover in the future.

Topic: Ross Ulbricht: FBI Didn't Have Search Warrant, Violated Fourth Amendment
### Original post:
A new statement released by the defense team of Ross Ulbricht, the alleged owner of Silk Road, a DarkNet drug marketplace, accuses the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) of violating the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. They claim that the Bureau did not have a legal search warrant when they found the Silk Road servers, which were located in Iceland. Ulbrichts defense has requested that the court drop all charges, since the federal government of the United States broke their own laws when seeking out the location of the Silk Road Servers.More info at <link>

### Reply 1:
IMO this case is too high profile for a judge to grant a dismissal. They are throwing the book at him to make an example so that others won't think about following in his footsteps

### Reply 2:
People started following in his footsteps within days.Still I love the low quality reporting by coinfinanceWell no that is not the case. Evidence from an illegal search can be excluded on the grounds that it violated the defendants rights. It is also possible that any subsequence evidence obtained could also be excluded ""fruit of the poisonous tree"". That is what the lawyer is seeking.Even if a judge agrees and excludes some or all of the evidence, it is possible to sustain the indictment using evidence which isn't excluded. On the other hand it is is possible that with the evidence excluded the government will not be able to meet the minimum burden required. The defense would then move to have the charges dropped with prejudice (jeopardy has already attached) on the grounds that the prosecution has not met its prima facie case. This could be done immediately and it could also be done when the prosecution rests its case. It would be a huge victory for DPR but there is no magic ""bad search = drop charges"" law in the US.

Nerds gotta have their fun, whereever or whatever they may be. I often wonder who Theymos really is.

### Reply 2:
You are posting this on a Bitcoin forum and are not being censored. Bitcointalk is generally uncensored.What you mean is that the subreddit r/bitcoin is censored. You are correct, but you're missing the point. They're not anything like the North Korean media, because the North Korean media is in the public sector and cannot be legally shown from the private sector. Therefore, in North Korea they are capable of censoring all other communication channels, whereas r/bitcoin cannot do this.

Topic: Main reason  government won't fully accept bitcoin
### Original post:
The kind of people we have in government are people who always want to fight for their selfish interests, anything that will surely benefit them. If it's something good that has to with better development for humanity as far as it won't benefit them they will surely go against it.The reason government won't accept bitcoin is not because it is a decentralized currency, it is because they won't be able to print it like they print fiat to steal as much as they can .If bitcoin is something the government can manipulate to steal public fund they would accept it even before now without any delay.

### Reply 1:
In developed countries where humanity is respected and citizens have rights to fight for their freedom, governments are not free to do everything they want. They have to step back and accept some requests from citizens.Oppositely in developed countries or ones from third world or from countries with dictatorship like Russia, North Korea, Cuba etc. people have zero freedom or little freedom. They don't have basic human rights and governments have more power.If Bitcoin won't die, governments can not banned it or killed it entirely. If they can not banned the Internet and can not restrict ASIC manufacturers and Bitcoin mining farms, they can not kill Bitcoin.They can not steal your bitcoin if you store your bitcoins in non custodial wallets.In contrast, they can steal your bitcoin if you store it on centralized exchanges that can be fully controlled by governments.

### Reply 2:
Most of the reasons as to why the govt would be adamant on fully accepting Bitcoin has been enumerated here but I'd like to point out another reason; encouraging and accepting Bitcoin will directly mean they are relinquishing control and without control over your finance, it becomes difficult for banks to dictate how you spend your finance.Till date, there has been the issue of banks and govt fighting against the digital coin, with it's penchant for high volatility, it is regarded by them as unstable and untrustworthy; these are true facts but their main reason of objection is so control is not taken from them. Too bad for them that the scales have fallen from people's eyes.

The most risky operations with finance were when i exchanging fiat money for cryptocurrencies through the exchanger, where you first need to send money to the exchanger and wait for the transfer of bitcoins

I don't get what zelle transfer is.I haven't tried making transaction on localbitcoin, don't have any accounts either but seeing there were crimes with it where one party robbed the other instead of exchanging. This is really a scary situation which is why this is something really not worth doing unless you do meet in the public place.

uhmm, well i think that all survey sites are basically the same as faucet sites, but they pay you not in bitcoin.So making surveys will yield you probably profit that is similiar with profit gotten from faucet sites... not worth it at all actually.

Topic: A friendly warning: the SEC is all over these boards. Don't break any laws.
### Original post:
I ran across this article back from November: <link> Hory sheet. 700,000 bitcoins at its peak? I can assure you if you run some kind of ponzi or scheme that violates US laws (and as you can see, a judge ruled that cryptocurrency ponzis are still illegal) then you have probably already caught the SEC's attention. If you make a lot of money off of one of these schemes, they will almost certainly come after you. With the EU ruling that Bitcoin is a currency, this is likely to only get more severe with time. Cryptocurrency, like the Internet in the 90's, is a new Wild West frontier. As such there are a lot of ways to make a lot of legitimate riches. There are also a lot of ways to violate traditional laws and get skullfucked by men in suits. Someone warned me they are aggressively looking for anyone here who claims their cryptocurrency represents a business, as this also is illegal (thanks fam). It elevates your crypto to the status of a traditional security, and you aren't authorized to do that. Finally, though I'm not aware of anyone being brought up on charges yet for it, you can bet your ass that the first convictions for ""internet securities fraud"" are only a matter of time with r<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Thanks for the heads up. SEC and other people in suit and tie should really be watching these boards seeing that there are a lot of illegal stuff going on. However, I am not afraid of it; I consider myself legitimate and earning in legit ways. It's just that there are no regulations here or whatsoever that I should worry about. Bad for people who made millions and chose to defect from the good side that made the gov't follow them (Garza, Karpeles etc.).

### Reply 2:
Yes thanks for the reminder.As a rule one should never post anything you are not willing to be repeated and or used in public. Which is kind of stating the obvious but many don't see their posts as being 'in the public' but just being on a forum.The internet is PUBLIC and everything you say can and will be used against you when you least expect it....

Hello, I am having a heck of a time finding a bank friendly to my bitcoin registered money services business. Can anyone point me in the direction of some banks that they have had success with?I have tried about 20 banks with no success. The only ones that are known to be friendly (I.e Silvergate) have minimum accounts volume/transactions that are far from within my business operations. Thanks for the time.

Topic: Can you give one reason why I should buy bitcoin?
### Original post:
A friend of mine once told me that I can become very by investing in bitcoin and <truncated> to him,he said some crypto analyst and experts have long predicted that bitcoin has the largest transfer of wealth and affluent The world has ever seen and that most of them that are investing in it will be the ones to be rewarded.I'm certainly not convinced about this information that he gave to me...I want better ideas and enlightenment on why I should buy bitcoin.I need help please!

### Reply 1:
The question you need to ask yourself is why do you want to buy bitcoin. For most people the sole purpose of buying and holding bitcoin is to save them selfs from traditional financial restrictions. Bitcoin has many benefits but the most important part ones is it been a store of value because it has limited supply and also hedges against inflation. For someone who is looking to save money without the fear of losing due to devaluation of the traditional financial system then bitcoin also solves that. Also bitcoin is a currency that can be use for payment purposes and this has been proved to be more efficient than traditional currencies or any other digital currencies most especially cross border transactions. Bitcoin also generates you profit while holding it because of its volatility which also in turns could cause loses but this can be minimized if youre looking to hold for a very long period of time. So the best thing is for you to do your own research and compare the risk and benefit of bitcoin and then relate maybe someone like you could actually get involved.

### Reply 2:
I would say you should invest in bitcoin because you beleive in it and not because someone told you to. For the sake of emphasises, I would repeat, Bitcoin and not altcoin. In recent times, altcoins has proven to be more risky than you would have imagined with most of them dumping to never rise again and an inexperience person could easily find themselves in a deep shit.Maybe this is some means to go about your research but, I would say you should make conscious effort to understanding all that it entails before investing.

What do you mean ""from blockchain to coinbase""? From where you got that error message?Hey Bro, do never use your private keys. Even i can't understand your issue but it seems you are doing some dangerous moves. Afaik, none would ask you for your private keys unless you are willing to migrate from a wallet to another but this option isn't available with coinbase wallet as far as i can remember.Whatever, do never reveal your private keys! And do never believe anyone contacting you in private pretending to help you, he is surely trying to steal your keys.You need to explain further your issue so we can help you.

Greetings,The Bitcoin Trading Group is now open for business. The BTG is a trading organization which allows individuals to follow a bitcoin traders transactions in the Mt. Gox market. The Bitcoin Trading Group has been managing a few accounts for a testing period and is now ready to open to the general public.The BTG is not a hedge-fund or investment service, but rather it is an opportunity for individuals to mimic a bitcoin traders trades for a performance fee (10%) based on a high watermark. The objective of the BTG is to maximize the bitcoin in a followers account and assess a performance fee based on the bitcoin generated. We value your privacy, so we do not require anything but API details through email.How it works:1.Open an account with Mt. Gox and fund it with bitcoin2.Create an API key to both get_info and trade and email this key to us3.We will trade your account and assess a performance fee based on profits generatedWhat we do:1.We will enter trades in a master account which will be mimicked in all participating accounts2.We will trade in the hopes of growing the bitcoin balance of individual participants3.We will invoice clients through the email which they provide req<rest of post truncated>

1. Past performance - 9.85% return this month in my personal account. In my other trading activities I made 2.5% in July and 2.6% in August. As a trader my first priority is to manage risk, so I only enter trades with the exit already located and sufficient liquidity in the market.2. The mimic part is run through a program created by a prominent developer in the bitcoin community. Basically the software gets an account balance of all the individuals who are participating in the program and lets me know how much bitcoin or USD I'm trading. When I enter a trade, it divides the quantity I am trading out to all the accounts which are participating based on a percentage ownership. Example - I have 3 customers. Two customers have 10 bitcoin, and one has 100 bitcoin for a total of 120 bitcoin under management. I enter a trade to sell 60 bitcoin. The first two customers with 10 bitcoin each have an 8.33% stake while the large customer has an 83.33% stake. My order is divided proportionately so the two customers each sell 5 bitcoin while the larger customer sells 50 bitcoin. The percent gain or loss I make on this trade will be mimicked across every account.3. The control you give me is tha<rest of post truncated>

Topic: would this be a good idea for doing safe bitcoin loans?
### Original post:
To get a loan on bitcointalk.org you must have some type of collateral. Someone should design a coin and premine it all the way out so that they own 100% of the coin. They should then create a website where people can go buy the coin with moneypak, perfect money, etc. Each coin should be valued at 5 dollars since loans tend to be big anyways. When you need a btc loan but don't have time to wait on coinbase or whatever your method is of getting coins you simply go get a moneypak (or whatever forum of money accepted) and go to the collateral website and purchase coins equiv. to the needed btc amount. You then come on bitcointalk.org and make a post for how much btc you need loaned and offer your collateral coins as collateral. If the users fails to repay the btc you just go to collateralcoins.com (just a name. not really the website) and redeem your coins for paypal, moneypak, etc. It would be up to the lender how many collateral coins the person wanting the loan will need to pay you. I suggest doing 125% just in case btc jumps up overnight like it has been doing lately and someone just runs off with your lended btc. With this method their would be one universal form of collateral an<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
The people buying the collateral coin would be the people that need to get a loan but don't have time to wait on coinbase, mtgox, etc.

### Reply 2:
Noo thats not what I mean... Lets say they wanted a 100 dollar loan for btc then they would buy 20 collateral coins (more if the lender request more for safety). And ideally this would just be for people needing quick btc. Not people that don't have money.. But like I said its just an idea. I don't plan on implementing it but it would be cool to see a trusted member do it.

Topic: Why trust anyone without a contract?
### Original post:
Good faith in services won't be enough, we have learned. I would strongly advise any new eWallet or Dwolla-like services offer a contract that when signed, legally obligates you to carry out your end of the services. This includes compensation for any losses.To the client-end, if they refuse to enter into a contract, DO NOT USE their services.If it may be difficult on how to structure such a contract - treat it as if it were a Bitcoin Constitution. Let the community build the template of this <truncated> 'All services must abide by these agreements herein'.

How do you grab bitcoins from inside a secure server?Seems like the insurance rates would have to have been sky high to cover the losses that people's friendly neighborhood hackers are showing them - or maybe not quite exactly showing them in detail - how to ""explain away"".I wonder how much losses paypal, e-gold, pecunix, alertpay and so on take regularly from these same or equivalent hackers?Hey maybe they even use sock-puppet accounts to get auctionable stuff from merchants and charge back the merchants so as to cover all the losses these hackers cause them? Maybe that'd be better than admitting these hacks are so easy, that no system, even made by security expert <truncated> is unhackable, that, rather, one simply has to plan to in effect ""pay off"" a certain percentage of customer funds to hackers?-MarkM- (Oh wait, did I forget a <sarc>...</sarc> somewhere in there?)

### Reply 2:
I am not sure how much experience you have with the real world already... But in the vast majority of cases a contract is only there to benefit the richest party of a transaction (whoever can afford the lawyer) and its sole purpose is to LIMIT liabilities such as ""having to pay for any losses"" No company would ever sign random different contracts with / and made by each customer that would hold them liable for things beyond their control. That is insanity.

Topic: A Social Network For Crypto Land
### Original post:
So I had a site, <link> that was an old doge faucet. I decided to turn it into a social network for crypto people.It's really basic right now. I'll be adding a bunch of crypto-ish features to it such as pricing and info as well as cleaning up or adding usability features.I figure it might give people a place to network with other crypto junkies without all the clutter of everything else you get on sites like fb & twitter.Check it out! There will be a random draw from the user profiles (that have profile pictures and posts) for a $100 worth of crypto to be given away.If you like the idea, awesome! If not, please don't spoil the fun. If nothing else this is just something for me to dabble with.

I think it will get more attention if you move this to the local section but it seems there is no Canada option in the local section. Anyway, I found a Canadian community in other languages try to post there to hire someone who lives in Canada.Here's the section. <link> option, make a new thread here ""Services section"" just add the amount you want to pay on the title so that it's more attractive to those who seek payment.It seems that FinderOuter is not hard to set up why not try to read this first below.- <link> down to find the guide on how to use it.I also suggest you make an issue on this link <link> so that they can help you how to install FinderOuter.

Topic: Less Worry: Celcius paid off its $114 million Bitcoin-backed loan in 24 hours.
### Original post:
Users of the crypto lending platform have finally felt some relief following Celcius Network's announcement that it has paid a total of $114 Million of its Bitcoin loan in the last 24 hours, lowering its liquidation price to $4,967This means that the Bitcoin price must fall below $4,967 before Celcius is <truncated> Reading: <link>

### Reply 1:
Why is Celsius paying-off debt? Of course, lowering the liquidation price for their WBTC. I got you! But, this was important when liquidation price was around 20k. Now it's <3k, and they're still paying off debt. Anyone knows the reason for this? How is this seen in the light of a potential bankruptcy? You are not allowed to choose, whom you pay off and whom not, when filing for bankruptcy. It does not make really sense to me.

### Reply 2:
instead of being in debt to some class action suit of millions of customers. they have relieved the customer debt(users of locked coin). by replacing it with corporate debtin short.a corporation injected them with alot of cash. which they bought up alot of coin.now they have more coin holdings which they can put up as more collateral behind the scenes to save off any liquidation. there is ~$440m of coins <truncated> and G.Sachs just handed them $2b to pull them out of the water of liquidation.this means they are out of the customer liquidation pond and now in the G.Sach debt lake

Topic: Global Charities: Salvation for Bitcoin
### Original post:
Bitcoin is in trouble.You may not agree with me, but at least hear me out (or read me out, since this is being written).For Bitcoin to succeed in the long run, it has to be widely adopted internationally, vendors, online retail companies, individuals, college students and your grandma all have to be able to use Bitcoin easily. The price can't be so volitile that it scares away regular folk. The price must be predictable enough that the factory in Vietnam will accept bitcoin for the products it is manufacturing for the market in Australia, and to pay for the raw material it gets from Brazil.What can kill bitcoin is having no exchanges to buy bitcoin. Or, if regular people cannot easily transfer fiat currency into an exchange to buy Bitcoin. Bitcoin won't survive if the only way to trade it is in person from someone met online or through OTC trades on irc freenode #bitcoin-otc.Unlike so many bitcoiners, I am not lent to believe in conspiracies.

Topic: How a social attack could defeat a prosperous Bitcoin network
### Original post:
In this thread I will propose a simple legal and social approach which will allow a government entity to take control over Bitcoin with minimal resistance. This attack is, in a way, much simpler than the various technical ones (building a super computer, etc).There have been a number of threads in this forum regarding ways a freedom-hostile entity, usually a government, could take control over Bitcoin and destroy its benefits such as inflation resistance and privacy. These threads so far have focused on the idea that the entity would either set up a super computer to become the largest miner in the world, or that the entity would hunt down the largest miners in existence and regulate/coerce them. The usual counterargument is that Bitcoin is too small to warrant that kind of attention, and later it will be too large to effectively mount such <truncated> the very popularity of a large Bitcoin network would open it up to being taken over by tricking the average uneducated user.

If this attack works, I suggest it should be tried on p2p filesharing networks first as a test. <truncated> that basically been tried? I don't think many people would use a non-open-source Patriot Edition.

### Reply 2:
Any closed source client would be prodded and reverse-engineered by the open source community. Even if this somehow doesn't expose the backdoor controls, any use of code that can be shown to have been taken from the open source community would expose the closed source client to using the copyright laws against them. This would not be the first time that China had been caught doing such things.In short, I'm not worried about it.

Topic: I started spending my bitcoins ;)
### Original post:
Hi,Just thought I'd write here to say that I have sent two bitcoins to a relative via bitmail asking her to spread the word. I also spent about 3 or 4 coins on a website to buy bitcoin fridge magnets and vinyl stickers. I'm going to put the sticker in my mining room. One of the fridge magnets is for me and the other one will go on the work fridge. There are 70 people working in my office.I may very very attach an article on what it is aswell. Give people something interesting to talk about over break. I'll make sure the article includes info the hideous charges the credit card companies are getting away with.Anyway the most important thing for me is that I have put some currency into the economy which is required if it's to grow. Even if you want to hoard because you believe the value will go up over time I'm not sure that will happen unless the economy grows. It's in your interest to put a percentage of your coins to help it grow.Also, I would have spent my bitcoins earlier but I have only started mining in July and just have myself more organised now. I was up the walls for the last two months getting everything configured.

### Reply 1:
For me the dilemma between saving and spending is mostly not related to the expectation of a higher price in the future. The most important factor is where can I spend coins and what can I buy with them. I live a fairly minimalistic lifestyle and don't really need that much. I'll spend coins when I find something useful to spend them on.I do understand that people spend coins simply because it's fun to try and buy something with coins for the first time. I don't do that because I generally don't buy anything unless I really need it.However I'm a Bitcoin-enthusiast and I think that the options for buying stuff, goods or services, will become ever larger as Bitcoin grows. The market has already grown massively in the recent months. This is why I'm not just saving everything, I got two different spending accounts already set up with more than enough Bitcoins for small purchases. One on my desktop and one on my Android phone. The savings I keep in a safe offline location.This is to say that I hope the merchants keep at it, because I will start spending more coins when I find something really useful to spend them on. Using coins is very convenient and cheap so why not, and the added ano<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 2:
+1This is it. I mean, we're reaching the stage where we can actually offer an easy way to start accepting Bitcoins, using Bit-Pay or other advanced merchant services. This is something I've been planning to work on, not only from an online standpoint but in the real world.The Bit-Pay mobile payment system changes the potential for physical stores to another level. I feel Bit-Pay will get competitors in the future that will copy their model and if I were them I would start a massive affiliate program as soon as possible.An affiliate program would mean that basically anyone could try and convert their favourite stores to Bitcoin, using Bit-Pay, and then Bit-Pay would pay them a percentage of some sort. In fact I think I'll ask if they're interested in implementing something like this.This would help a lot because there would be added incentive for everyone to get stores to accept Bitcoin.

Topic: How can we fasten the transaction of payment in BITCOIN paying high fees?
### Original post:
It seems that even you pay fees when transacting or sending through blockchain with bitcoin, you still have to wait for a mean time or maybe a long period of time, but there is a free of charge in sending bitcoin and when you look at the blockchain you ride along with another sender/hash that is paying a fee, is it unfair or there is a logically explanation behind it?.

### Reply 1:
To get a confirmation, your transaction has to be included into a block. Unfortunately, blocks aren't fixed at 10 minutes. Varience can cause the blocks to be up to several hours apart and your transaction will not have one confirmation until then no matter how much fees you paid.Fees acts as a deterrence against spam and as an income for miners. If the fees doesn't exist, spam attacks would take little to no cost and miners would not have any income after the block reward becomes 0.Miners, although majority choose to queue transactions by fees/size, they can choose to exclude certain transactions even though they may have high fees.

### Reply 2:
It is not guarenteed that if you broadcast your transaction with a high fee you will get it included at the next block.At the last months bitcoin became more popular so it is pretty hard to have you transaction included in the 1st block that comes out unless you include a very high fee.

Topic: Do Your Part and Dont Kill BTC
### Original post:
A) It's that time of year where everything drops,B) We all knew about the volatility before we started.Now for the kicker; BTC works a lot like fiat (from what I can tell). In the fiat market, when people are not spending, the value drops considerably. If money is not changing hands then it becomes worthless. Everyone on here saying ""Be strong and HODL"" are not helping. The more we use it, the more demand there will be. Companies see it working for competition and they are more likely to adopt. Fees are practically non-existent now so there is no excuse.I will be treating crypto just like fiat going forward. Keep a healthy amount in reserve, save some, and allocate a certain amount for spending. I even decided to use crypto to hire a developer for an app I've been putting off for 2 years now.Will you spend a little more due to drops? Sure. But that is a small price to pay if you want to be a part of the growth and future of crypto.

That's the spirit! but I think that cryptocurrency and Fiat are the same, if you are saying that fiat's price is dropping because of people not engaging in using them they in Cryptocurrency the more you hodl the more it increase, well right now we can see that the price is in a resistance state because of people converting bitcoin to fiat and I really think that if we do our part we can simply say to just hodl and wait for the price to pump again, But this is not possible because we can not control the decisions and emotions of certain hodlers,

### Reply 2:
Problem is bitcoin is not yet prepared to be used as a payment system. Right now it is slow and transaction fees are high, the price fluctuation scares companies away. Unless these problems are addressed, bitcoin will never move from store of value to a reliable mode of payment. We all wanted to utilize bitcoin the way it was intended to be but right now it is not yet feasible.

*I've been up for 30 Hours, Please forgive grammar mistakes and small scuffs in my logic.*So im sitting here and I'm listening to all of these Bitcoin advocates, a few being Roger Ver, Erik Voorhees, etc etc and they are preaching about the inevitability of bitcoin becoming ""the"" global currency in the face of widespread collapse of the banking system <truncated> at first that made sense to me, if fiat fails why wouldn't people convert to bitcoin. Thats where that B.S for the $1 Million dollar btc comes from. BEST CASE SCENARIO for btc adoption right? Well not quite. We know that Bitcoin is not truly decentralized, it's the closest thing we have but lets face it, the fact that one country(a few pools) controls the most of the ENTIRE network's hash rate is a failure of decentralization. I will call it ""Geographic Centralization"". My only issue with geographic centralization is that a bitcoin revolution could easily be shut down by a governing body, and if that does occur the network would be crippled after losing 70% of the hash rate. So with that being said. I present two scenariosA:IF Mass adoption* occurs then the centralized systems (or players) will consolidate their position ""<rest of post truncated>

You could read the Reddit discussion between Professor Jorge Stolfi and TPTB_need_war, which explained this.And SegWit is all about centralization of validation, so that we get a 666 enslavement system. Do you think the powers-that-be invested $70 million in Blockstream for no reason. Come on. You don't think (Mr. ZIRP and Russian oligarchy maker) Larry Summers (who is on the board of 21 Inc.), Peter Thiel (BitPay, gifted $100k to Vitalik @ Ethereum, etc), and other banksters elite are in on that.

This quote shows also that he's probably not that young since he knows about the time sharing computers in the nineties. And indeed a great quote. Clearly showing the trust deficiency in the current money system.

He's not that young, and he's been writing about economic theory for quite some time. You can see his blog here: <link> In 1993, he also described how to maintain a pseudonomous identity online, which is seemingly working pretty well for him to date: <link>

Topic: Bitcoin is the creation of Satoshi from zero to one
### Original post:
I have been reading and writing on bitcointalk recently. I try to write my understanding of Bitcoin in the past few years and share it with you here. My words is mainly based on my deep thinking about Bitcoin. My original thinking was fragmented and unsystematic. Now I record my thinking process in the form of words and output it. Only in this way is it possible to aggregate fragmented information into systematic knowledge. At the same time, in the process of communicating with everyone, let my thinking be further improved. This is the benefit of the collision of ideas, so that you can continue to grow.Through the two days of posting and communication, I found that more and more people are understanding and approving Bitcoin. However, our understanding of Bitcoin may still be shallow. Many times we still cannot understand the essence of Bitcoin or the meaning it represents. We still can't fully feel the greatness of Bitcoin. In my opinion, Bitcoin is the quintessence of all the knowledge of mankind, and it represents a new civilization. The Bitcoin created by Satoshi is a complete creation from zero to one.What I want to say is that the knowledge system covered by Satoshi's creatio<rest of post truncated>

On the technical, coding side there is a lot of people who were capable of creating a system like Bitcoin, as evidenced by the amount of altcoins that are now created. Okay, so yeah a lot of them use Bitcoin as the foundation, but they also come with their own different flavours, and improvements. However, Satoshi didn't only have to code the whole thing, he had to think of the idea, and try to use hindsight on predicting what the world would look like in 10, 20 years, and beyond. He had to come up with an idea, and solution on how to keep Bitcoin having a constant injection into the economy, while not releasing too much too early. So, he implemented difficulty, which sort of regulates the amount of Bitcoin in circulation at a time. He also had to come up with a way of securing the transactions, and this is probably the most impressive part of the whole thing. Implementing something which prevents double spending, isn't something that a lot of people could do, well at least thinking of the solution, and then implementing it. I don't think Satoshi is as super human as people tend to think of them as though. However, they saw a problem, and implemented a solution. There are definite <rest of post truncated>

Topic: Future of digital money depends on smart phone technology and people's knowledge
### Original post:
All of us - the people present on this forum all know Bitcoin and all coin famous.But I think the future development of digital currencies to replace banknotes or banks depends greatly on one of the following factors:1. Qualifications and knowledge of the people. Because the majority of people today do not fully understand block-chain and technology. So if you want to use cryptocurrency like paper money today, all people have to know how to use technology2. Smart phones - Must be integrated with technology to make it convenient for people to use3. Simplification of cryptocurrency developers. How can people easily use like paper money.And what do you think about my opinion?

### Reply 1:
Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general will grow despite:1. People not knowing how blockchain technology works just as they do not know how money really works. They only need to know how to spend it. Creating and exploring Facebook is much more complicated than using a Bitcoin wallet. And besides, it is always either you bend or you break. That is one truth in life. 2. It is not Bitcoin that needs to adjust; the smartphones do.3. Cryptocurrency development is a very complicated thing and only selected individuals around the world are capable enough to get involved in it. The rest do not need to know, much less learn, crypto development. As I've said, people only need to learn how to spend and perhaps keep it securely. Well a choice of wallet may take care of it. Crypto is much easier to use actually. They don't even need to count the change or do mathematics every time one spends, unlike with fiat.

### Reply 2:
I fully agree on the potential of smartphones towards widespread use and acceptance of Bitcoin, cryptocurrency in general and the blockchain technology. Tied to the popularity of smartphones is the coming revolution of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) which can be synergistically working with the blockchain and cryptocurrency as well. In short, the smartphone can be acting like a hub for the user to access all of these technologies and developments. And when we are talking about education, things can now be simplified as more and more people are carrying smartphones. Now, we actually don't need (though it can be a good advantage) for people to fully understand cryptocurrency beyond the basics or the <truncated> level what is important is that people understand how they can participate in cryptocurrency and how they can claim their stake on it. Any new technology that can game-changing will always have a learning curve and can face resistance on the market but after getting around the critical mass level things will be changing. I am expecting the same thing can happen with the blockchain and cryptocurrency especially with Bitcoin.

Topic: Does Peter Vessenes have giant holdings in BTC??  If so, why crash it?
### Original post:
I was just pondering some thoughts on the fact the Coinlab is suing Mt. Gox. Some people are speculating that it could be fatal to BTC but then I would think if Peter Vessenes has a good number of BTC (Which I assume he does) then why in the world would he want to undermine his own BTC? It does not make any sense. I can see him doing this just to ""stir the pot"" so to speak so he can get a better exchange service up and running, but I don't think people should panic. I highly doubt Peter Vessenes wants nothing other than to make BTC grow and is willing to do whatever it takes to do that. Any thoughts?

### Reply 1:
It's all speculation at this point. We don't know all the details, and who's really pulling the strings. We do know that Venture Capital is involved, and when things are not moving as expected, I would think these guys have a voice.As for MtGox, they've had lots of things to deal with lately, and as such, the transition may not have been in the front of their minds. I don't know. Coinlab has claimed that MtGox has tried to 'ban' some of the Coinlab customers, but I know no details about this.Also we do not know under what conditions the initial agreement was made. There are many things that's unclear at this point.

Topic: Bitcoin Calendar and Important Days
### Original post:
Bitcoin is not just a digital currency , but a revolution and for some its like following a religion ... Days on which bitcoin is celebrated .. Here are some which i mentioned , if somehow missed any please feel free to add ... and also share your opinion about what you feel about specific days out of this list ... Have u ever contributed or u have any experience of any of such days ...January 3 - Bitcoin Day January 11 - Bitcoin Running Day January 27 - Silk Road DayFebruary 24 - Mt.Gox Day March 9 - Cypherpunk Day April 5 - Satoshi's DayMay 10 - Lightning Day May 22 - Bitcoin Pizza Day August 1st- Bitcoin Independence Day August 21- Bitcoin Infinity Day October 31 - Bitcoin Whitepaper Day November 4 - Bitcoin Logo Day November 8 - Shitcoin Day December 18 - HODL Day

### Reply 1:
To be very honest, i don't know most of these days expect a few. Even i don't see people talking about them on those days mentioned.Among all these days, it was bitcoin pizza day which is known to everyone and some of people celebrate it too. I have seen people share the bitcoin pizza day pictures here on bitcointalk where they have decorated pizza with some bitcoin designs and celebrated.

### Reply 2:
For, I am only familiar with ""Bitcoin pizza day"" which represents the day an individual bought two pizzas with over 10,000 Bitcoins worth $40 back then, and I have no idea about the rest. But I think there are some days here that make no sense and I don't see any reason why they are important to Bitcoin in any way, such as Independence Day, Bitcoin Infinity Day, Bitcoin Whitepaper Day, Bitcoin Logo Day, Bitcoin Day, and HODL-day. Because I think these days makes no sense, but it would have nice if only had you explained it a more better

Topic: What is the best platform to raise funds in the crypto world?
### Original post:
I was wondering what do you guys think is the best platform to raise funds if someone wants to raise funds from within the community without involving a VC?

### Reply 1:
You can probably go to the Project Development section of this forum. In order to potentially get any money you will probably need to have a detailed business plan, although with somewhat of an established business, in other words you will probably not receive funding from an idea alone.

Topic: Jamie Dimon Says He's Done Talking About Bitcoin
### Original post:
JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon has said he won't be commenting on bitcoin anymore.It's a statement that comes a month after his now-infamous declaration that the cryptocurrency is a ""fraud."" Dimon made the remarks during a third-quarter earnings call with reporters this morning, as cited by CNBC.He reportedly said:""I wouldn't put this high on the category of important things in the world, but I'm not going to talk about bitcoin anymore.""Source: <link> after bitcoin hits its new all time high earlier today he realizes that he was wrong? And finally the clown stops spreading false informations. What are your thoughts?

### Reply 1:
I dont care. Most of us are done with listening to guys like him. Bitcoin was created as an alternative to the system he is an important part of so its not surprising that criticism comes from it. I think it is positive to be able to weigh different opinions and consider criticism towards bitcoin but what its not positive is to listen to FUD from establishment.

### Reply 2:
He better be not talking about Bitcoin or manipulating market in any way just for company's profit. I don't think that this statement came as a setback of his earlier statement going wrong. But because he encountered huge criticism for him calling Bitcoin a fraud and creating a fud for buying Bitcoin at dip. Other bankers of the Wall Street are in favor of Bitcoin and are thinking of providing crypto related services. JPMorgan certainly can't lose that opportunity by being wary of Bitcoin and losing off their competitors. This is simple business.

Topic: Hacker Stole 1,000 Traders Personal Data From CryptoTrader.Tax
### Original post:
A hacker has stolen data on more than 1,000 users from CryptoTrader.Tax, an online service used to calculate and file taxes on cryptocurrency trades.The hacker broke into a CryptoTrader.Tax marketing and customer service employees account on a support center platform, according to a source who came across the hacker on a dark web forum. With this access, the hacker could see customers names, email addresses, payment processor profiles and messages sometimes containing cryptocurrency incomes.The hacker then screengrabbed samples of this sensitive information, posted them on the forum to entice potential buyers of the data trove and sent additional pictures to the source, who shared this evidence with CoinDesk.David Kemmerer, a co-founder and the chief executive of CryptoTrader.Tax, confirmed to CoinDesk that a hacker gained unauthorized access on April 7 to the marketing and customer service employees account.

### Reply 1:
I'm just wondering how they know the other information such as the passwords are not in custody of the hacker. It is not unbelievable to see hacker stealing information but it become worrisome when they have direct access to your account. The hacker might not compromise the password by changing it but might know the passwords. This is part of the reason why people have not supporting centralized platforms

### Reply 2:
Sounds more like an inside job as without the proper authorization no one can access the account of an employee or the employee was a dumb.Other reason can be that CryptoTrader do not have the highest level of security features or firewall activated in their system.Anyways it is big dent to their reputation and trust.

1) those guys distanced themselves from Mt Gox long ago when they no longer factored MT Gox's rates into their calculations for their published rates, 2) why do you need anyone of them to tell you that MG is bad when the evidence and your own brain told you that? 3) this forum told everyone long ago, before those guys made their disconnections to leave MG alone, and4) this wasn't the first time MG jammed the btc community, the prior matter was only months ago. Believe it or not folks this forum collectively knows more than any individual, or any whole company, in the cryptocurrency industry about Bitcoin.

Kindly answer me about CEX.IO ... BLOCKCHAIN ?? ETC

what about CEX.IO to make a trade buy/sell kindly is there any trusted list?

### Reply 2:
If you aren't believing in this kind of service, then I suggest you to use Bitcoin Core. Because you are the only one who can manage your own money there, and you also the only one that has to take the risk of the money.Or you can also use any other wallet, I. Paper Wallet, Cold Wallet, or Brain Wallet.

A ""thought"" just shot through my mind:Seeing all these ""advertisements"", I quickly realized that instead of spreading the word about BTC, we should HUSH! and not speak a word about it!I'd like to quote satoshi here:Although attraction from unwanted sides is part of the picture, there is an even bigger, more important reason to keep this amongst us, at least as far as possible...The bigger reason is that a quick spread of word favors the already patronized ""early adopters"" even more! But not only that - early adopters are benefiting in a compounding, exponential fashion, widening the gap between the ""haves"" and the ""have-nots"" even more. If the reason for this is not instantly obvious, let me explain: say you own 10 BTC for $15 each, giving you $150. An early adopter owns 1000BTC for $15 each. Now word spread and noobs start buying into BTC, making the price rise to say $20 for a coin.This situation massively favours the early guy, making him a profit of $5000 USD, while the ""little guy"" only earns $50 USD. Since mining and buying is equally costly/difficult for both of them, we can assume that under the condition of both players continuing to mine/buy, time will even the gap.If bot<rest of post truncated>

(snip the quote)Agreed. There is no hurry for bitcoin to grow in price. Slow and careful development of the technology will lead to long term profits for anyone willing to invest the time into bitcoin.

### Reply 2:
The early adopters deserve their fortune. They took on the risk back when Bitcoin was new and when its future wasn't clear. In this case, their investments (mining hardware and/or money, time) paid off, but it could've gone either way.

This is an article from pravda.ru, as I understand from their description is a tabloid and one of the lowest of the low, but it is still owned by people in the government so I guess they won't publish something that might hurt the reputation of their country without a bit of truth somewhere in this. <link> translation as the translation my own local newspaper did is far worse than that, if somebody speaks Russian and there are errors please highlight those.Now we had dancers getting tips with QR tattoos, we had escorts occasionally taking crypto payments, but now we have (if we believe this) an entire industry that is moving to ditch the ruble for cryptos as probably dollars are now even harder to get, especially with a ban on foreign currency purchase. Tossing aside the fact that probably this still happens at a small scale and most of the escorts there probably are not accustomed to bitcoin nor do they have the means of exchanging those for goods and pay for stuff without rising eyebrows I can see a bit of hope this thing might be catching a bit of momentum.The country has blocked people from seeking a safe haven in foreign currencies, the trust in their own is down the drain, bu<rest of post truncated>

A lot of mobile wallets are out there can really make that happen and if other prostitutes around the world get inspired by this article they can also start to accept Bitcoin.The only problem that I see here would be the fees because where I am located you can sometimes in some remote villages find a prostitute for just 5 EUR or like 10-20 EUR in cities,I am not talking about escorts that cost like 300-500 EUR for night.Many people would be turned down by fees if fees in the Bitcoin network are high at the moment of the ""meeting"".

### Reply 2:
If you read the news shared by the stompix, you will find that it is not about only bitcoin, but all the cryptocurrencies. This means that prostitutes can take money in litecoin, dogecoin or any other crypto currencies where they do not have to pay the fee and also the transaction speed will be fast. The big question remains that are all the prostitutes are so educated that they know how the crypto currencies work

Topic: Lessons from Facebook and the attempted shutdown of Telegram
### Original post:
Do you guys believe that bitcoin will fluctuate less due to bad news?Just like Facebook can pass government regulations, as well as telegram did today, I belive Bitcoin and descentralized technology won't be affected by such attempts and people will realize that. Therefore, leading to less sudden drops. I hope I was able to explain my point. What do you guys predict?

### Reply 1:
I think you meant to say that bitcoin will be less influenced by governmental regulations than centralized entities such as facebook and telegram?While your point has merit, it is also easily argued against. While bitcoin itself cannot be controlled or regulated, the users of it can be, governments instead will pass regulation on how much bitcoin someone can hold, what level of verification is needed, etc etc. In order for bitcoin to be truly free from the influences of regulation from a price point of view it would need for the community to be completely free of governments control, which sadly is not a reality.

### Reply 2:
Facebook and google not ban bitcoin but they ban cryptocurrency related ads. It is not related to bitcoin. There are many ways to advertise. The biggest suporters are via from bounty in bitcointalk. It is very targeted market to spread out ICO. In the end, facebook and google ban effect nothing to bitcoin.

Topic: Creating a module for new BitCoin sites
### Original post:
With PayPal freezing the accounts of BitCoin traders, one of the most effective approaches is to consider the many other services out there that would enable conventional currency <-> BitCoin transactions. The idea would be to have interested users evaluate the various options, and then build a site which allowed users to forward money to it and have it purchase BitCoins from other users as they became available.These new sites could provide an interface to various credit card processors and many ATM services, as well as online banks and friendly credit unions. Plenty of opportunities for relationships can be formed, and new sites created within the community would be able to make that happen.To allow these new sites to be created, a Drupal module is being developed to allow essentially anyone to create their own site in Drupal, free, open-source and known for being very easy to create with no programming knowledge. All the programming is done by module writers, and site creators merely need to plug the module in and configure it with a point-and-click interface.The author of the module is asking what features the community would like.

Ok, I've looked into the various different colored coin options out there and it seems strange that there should need to be wallets and protocols built around it.Couldn't I just declare an address as the source and any addresses transferred to from there are then colored?For example:I start a new company and want to use colored coins for stocks.In the company bi-laws, announcements, website, basically every official location for the company so that it is publicly available, we announce the starting Bitcoin address <truncated> fill it with 100 bitcoinsThen we specify that every .0001 bitcoins is worth 1 share of the company.When someone buys 1 share then from the 100 bitcoins .0001 bitcoins is sent to a public key that they specify. They now own that share. They can now sell it if they want or just keep the private key and hodl.Since the blockchain keeps track of every transaction you could just have a website tracking that first 100 bitcoin address and any transactions from there. Any future share actions can easily pull up all of the addresses and their share amounts.Dividend payment would be easy because you just send it to each public key based on the balance amount. Someone mig<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
I was just wondering, how do you picture that you buy a share? With fiat money through a bank transfer? It would make little sense to send 0.001 to get 0.001 in return. Unless the price of one share would be 1 BTC, then will you send 1 BTC to get a share (in form of 0.001) in return. What will den prevent the company to just issue new shares. Could be misunderstod as a ponzi scheme.

### Reply 2:
If it is established that the 1 share represents more than just the .001 bitcoin then that value and scarcity would give it added value.This 5 cent nickel was purchased for over $3 million.

Topic: Bitcoin vs Apple Pay
### Original post:
The debate between bitcoin and Apple Pay rages on, as early adopters weigh the differences and advantages of either particular system. Apple Pay, announced as a payment system which could allow payments to be made directly from the iPhone among other Apple devices, was announced in 2014 and has many of the Apple loyal raving its potential for friction-less commerce. Bitcoin likewise, is a payment system which promises to make a leap into electronic exchange, yet has very important distinctions between what Apple is aiming for with their platform.BITCOIN VS APPLE PAYMARKET CAPITALIZATION 2015 ($ MILLIONS)The Apple Pay infrastructure can be seen as an overlay network ontop of our everyday purchases in the way we conduct the transaction. The bitcoin technology is a deeper, more core aspect of what this infrastructure entails because it not only radically alters the way we conduct the transactions, but the type of value we transact.Read the full article on Diginomics.

### Reply 1:
You can't expect the dumb herd to pick something called ""Bitcoin"" over something called ""Apple Pay"".We'll need more years of being bitchslapped by banks and goverments until they get the point.

### Reply 2:
We can say apple pay is designed for apple users to pay for their stuffs online. Bitcoin is digital currency will be unique and biggest invention for the last 500 years. This is revolutionary digital currency which is to be explored yet. Apple has wealth to support it's paying service but can not be not compared with bitcoin.

The halfway point was probably around $30k when it could easily have dumped back to $20k for a long bear market, or pumped up to $40k and continued the bull run. Thankfully it looks like we're heading up towards the ATH again so it's a good time to invest - certainly better than buying at $60k!

### Reply 2:
Yeah we are not late, but i have doubts because of some fluctuation in the market and TBH i don't see any important news behind of this sudden increased in bitcoin.. It's very quite though. and only news after the bump all i can see which is there's no significant results around the internet. So how we can trust this mprovements that happening in BTC.? Maybe just good for short term.. So better luck next time for us who missed this opportunity to make quick profits. LmaoNevertheless if it keeps surging then its good no regrets probably it's not really for us.

Topic: Poll: Do you use first-class messaging?
### Original post:
First-class messaging, where the ""Signatures"" tab is part of the main window, was originally the default mode of operation for the Sign Message GUI function, but was relegated to the menu by default due to uncertainty of how much use it would get. I think 0.6 has proven it useful (for example, Bitcoin OTC now uses it for primary authentication) and it should be given first-class by default. However, others disagree and even want to remove the option (to make it first-class) entirely. Supposedly I'm the only one who wants message signatures to be first-class. I am hoping this poll will prove the <truncated> messaging is a compile-time feature for Bitcoin-Qt 0.6. By adding the <truncated> option to qmake, builds will treat message signing the same way as other Bitcoin-Qt functions, instead of relegated to another dialog via the menu as it is by default. On Gentoo, users can enable it simply by installing with the ""1stclassmsg"" USE flag.Note that the Verify Message will be available with both first-class and second-class messaging.

I am in fintech space responsible for platforms that trade bonds. I am starting to consider how blockchain technology can be used to facilitate the transfer of securities aspect from a buyer to seller. Here is the business scenario (expressed simply):1. Buyer meets Seller through an electronic platform. This is not as trivial as hitting a price on a screen as is the case in Equity or FX markets. There are number of Request-For-Quote, Order Based and Crossing systems that are designed to generate a trade between two parties whilst attempting to minimize the information leakage to the wider market in the process.2. For this scenario I am assuming buyer has found a seller without a broker intermediary through a crossing platform. Each party to the trade doesn't know the other party is i.e. it is totally anonymous. The crossing platform in my scenario has two functions. Firstly it enables each party to find the other and agree on the trade details. Secondly it is responsible for ensuring the security is transferred between two parties on the terms agreed to. The secondary aspect can be referred to as 'clearing'.3. Both parties have to trust the platform and the platform in return has t<rest of post truncated>

### Original post:
Just read a good news and wanted to share:-A very renown company like HTC just released a smartphone which have full node capabilities in which the user can actually generate their own keys and even run transactions without the use of any extra software or wallet .They have also placed the price somewhat affordable like 250$ for per piece and this is something that is no other smart phone in the history ever did .What do you think will be the next step since more companies are now going to be influenced by what they did therefore ; the acceptance is now wide spread therefore we can expect the price to increase further .Is it beneficial ?What is it's scope in the future further ?

### Reply 1:
I like what HTC is trying to do here even though their mobiles are not very popular. I don't really know the technical stuff involved here, but the intention is great and other companies should follow suite. $250 is a pretty great price in this aspect and I will definitely check it out soon.

### Reply 2:
Is good that HTC make this type of phone, but maybe if is full node people will not let phone to run so much time for the node and running a node without rewards can not be like by some people.

Topic: Article claims bitcoin mixers are no longer safe
### Original post:
I came accross this article <link> sure if this info is already known or not but I am interested in hearing peoples opinion on the claims that bitcoin mixers are no longer safe. It lists a few specifics ones there. The main questions are1. If this article is true, are there any mixers that work differently than the ones mentioned in this article?2. Would using 2 mixers help? For example sending the coins to a wallet using a mixer, then sending the coins somewhere else again using a different mixer to another wallet. So if one mixer is compromised, at lest you have the other to fall back on.3. Article states blockcahin analysis was used to track the bitcoins. Therefore making mixing completely useless since software and tools can now defeat them.

### Reply 1:
I disagree that mixers aren't safe anymore because the article only mentioned some mixers. I haven't used any of those mixers but I think it's possible to create a different mixer an example I could give is ChipMixer. Imo it depends on the mixers, if the two mixers you're using are similar to those above then it won't complicate things that much for them

### Reply 2:
So the article only mentions some of the mixers as an example, not to be taken literally.Source: <link> understandable to be skeptical about centrally operated tumblers, and AFAIK most of them (the tumblers) are centralized. Thus the anonimity rely on how they function. Here to see some research/discussion about this matter: <link>

Topic: Why not use Exchange instead of Mixer?
### Original post:
So, Mixers provide service of shuffling bitcoins or provide addresses loaded with bitcoins along with private keys. In short, they provide service so to create anonymity between sender's and receiver's address so that no one can trace the transaction.My question is why not use Exchanges? When we deposit funds on exchange, bitcoins get deposited on exchange's cold wallet. But when we withdraw funds, withdraw gets processed from exchange's hot wallet. So in short, it is very easy to do anonymous transfer by depositing funds on exchange and withdrawing to other addresses. Why to pay 1-3% fees on Mixers when it could be done for much less on Exchanges. Exchanges like Binance charge just 0.0005 BTC to process withdrawals.

### Reply 1:
In my opinion, it does not matter if you use a mixer or a centralized exchange to ensure anonymity - this is not good enough, and the possible negative side effects from both solutions are rather unpleasant. The need in both cases to trust a third party is something that contradicts the central idea of bitcoin. But in the absence of something better, this can be used carefully, aware of the risk.Yes, but theres a higher risk of getting bitcoins from the mixer, which can be marked as dirty.

### Reply 2:
I am sure we will choose what we feel comfortable. And if we feel that it is better to use exchange than the mixer, then we can choose the exchanges to send and receive bitcoin. But for some people who are not comfortable with that way, they will use a mixer because they care about their personal information. Besides that, they don't want to send any documents. Maybe they have their reason why they are comfortable with the mixer, and we have a different way of deposit and withdraw bitcoin.

Topic: While Everyone was Talking about El Salvador! We forgot about Guatemala
### Original post:
We all know El Salvador was the first country to officially accept Bitcoin as its legal tender. We do know the problems El Salvador has been facing after that, many here would not accept it but the truth cannot be suppressed. In the meantime, Guatemala which neighbors El Salvador has been busy adopting Bitcoin the right way. Like El Salvador Bitcoin was never forced onto Guatemala. Their economy is far better than their neighborhood yet every local has shown an inclination toward Bitcoin. I was surprised when I saw it on Youtube. I came across this video which will prove that Bitcoin can only succeed in a country when everyone accepts it and knows its value through grass root penetration. I mean everyone here came together when someone recommended Bitcoin.The Untold Secrets of Guatemala's Bitcoin Lake

### Reply 1:
I thought it's new, but actually Guatemala already friendly with Bitcoin since the last year [1] but it's just underrated since the country is small and not accept Bitcoin as a legal tender, it's just similar with the other countries which accept Bitcoin as commodities and no have any rule about currency adoption. So these countries can use Bitcoin to buy anything ad long as the stores accept it.[1] <link>

### Reply 2:
Yes I agree with you @OP because I also believe that Bitcoin can only succeed in a country that it is generally accepted rathen in countries that has mixed feelings towards it.I think the wrong concept of Bitcoin is what is actually slowing the adoption of Bitcoin because basically most people see Bitcoin as a means of getting rich or a means of investment but rather the main concept of Bitcoin is to have a digital currency that helps fight against the monopoly of physical Fiat but just as a member of a forum said that the early adopter of Bitcoin were the ones that instilled the mindset of using the volatile nature of Bitcoin to comb in profit and ever since then, people are already trained towards such mindsets.Let's fix this mindset and watch the global adoption of Bitcoin.

Topic: Kim Dotcom Says Greece Will Crash Market; Buy Bitcoin and Gold
### Original post:
Internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom advised his followers to invest in either Bitcoin or gold, claiming that values will rise once Greece prompts the global market to crash again.Do you think it can really go that way? Should I buy some more Bitcoins then? And how soon it might happen?

### Reply 1:
They will never adopt Gold or Bitcoin; but perhaps another form of digital currency. Highly doubt it will be decentralized tho.. hehe

### Reply 2:
Kim Dotcom's only speculating that Greece will exit the EU, he can't predict the future. It's also difficult to predict what will happen to Bitcoin and gold prices if Greece exits the EU.Do your own research and make your own mind up based on it rather than relying on Kim Dotcom. I'd say it's 50/50 whether Greece exits the EU and not a foregone conclusion.

Topic: The Catch 22 Of Reality Of Crypto
### Original post:
One of the popular thoughts and beliefs on crypto especially Bitcoin. The belief is that Bitcoin should be the main money system in the world for getting goods and services vs just being a store of value. All of these ideas are written in the Bitcoin white paper.Reasons for Bitcoin is the constant ever growing amount of inflation that the current fiat systems of money that create for majority of the populations. However many have to realize that there are limitation from this happening. Not saying that it could or will happen though.For Bitcoin or any other new system to come into effect we need to have majority of the population to use and accept such a system.There are a many things standing in the way of this. One of those limitations is that there is nearly not enough effort on creating and spreading positive awareness on it as some government and individuals alike is hell bent on spreading negativity around and poisoning the minds of prospective users. People need to be aware and understand what bitcoin is really about and be awake to its uses.You could get lots of information about anything on the internet including bitcoin. But the internet can be misleading to newbies cause<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Completely misunderstood assumption I believe. First things first: bitcoin has not accomplished main stream adoption as of now so we can not really Call it main money system. I think thats what you trying to say with just different terminology. For bitcoin to be accepted throughout world needs some sort of regularities. Like every place I go there should be peeps, businesses, small to big shops accepting bitcoin as mode of payment. Going further online shopping sites with easy to make payment. Im not saying those systems which acts as middle party so that we can easily make crypto to fiat payments. It should be direct. But all of this not happening as of now. Even though we have some countries accepting bitcoin but there are more countries than that who do not like the idea of bitcoin. Moreover defining its value isnt fixed. Would be difficult to streamline product and services prices to unless you dont agree to state the price conversion 1BTC=1BTC

### Reply 2:
Arguably, people don't even realise that they actually need something. You know the amount of people I hear slagging off banks, and not trusting them? Then they're ignoring that there are alternatives despite saying ""But we're forced too"". People tend to just follow the trends, we are very much sheep penned in most of the time. I know its a hard thing to accept, but we've become pacified to the point where we actually believe we need x service, and y service. Sure, some people genuinely like the convenience, but I bet if you asked the majority of people without mentioning Bitcoin if they would like to be in full control of their money, without relying on third parties the majority would be interested. Bitcoin unfortunately has been dragged through the mud, and therefore there's a negative stigma to it.

Topic: Simple question - what is the root of the ""math"" that we are doing?
### Original post:
I've only been mining a couple weeks now, but with two GPUs and two CPU threads going I've amassed some coinage. I posted on a popular forum's distributed computing section what everyone thought of bitcoin and I've received some troubling replies. The one that gets me the most (and the one that I can't seem to find an answer to) is this: just what is all this hashing for? Is it really merely to find the next block, are we unknowingly cracking for some devious entity? It would appear that they will not accept the former as an answer, even though they all run F@H and WCG clients and can't truly trace the math they are doing either.

### Reply 1:
You're running SHA-256 calculations, trying to find a hash that is below a certain target number (correct me if I'm wrong on the hash part, I'm not 100% on whether we hash numbers or find the number to match the hash). So in effect you're making rainbow tables, which is encoded in the blockchain. It's an inefficient and unoptimized table though, so it doesn't really matter.No shady stuff here This is all determinable by looking at the source code, btw. You don't need to believe me.

### Reply 2:
Still,He makes a point. It would be a shame to to have all that hashing go to waste. I would like to look for collisions or at least report the collisions.

Topic: formatting small numbers
### Original post:
let me propose formatting small <truncated> one is better to read?currently no standard to display small numbers.I know we use mBTC, uBTCbut not good for newbies.let me propose using commas at each 3 digits under decimal point.

### Reply 1:
First one is easier to read. Commas get in the way and are confusing when looking at the number. Makes me think we are talking millions instead of decimal places of bitcoin.

### Reply 2:
that will never work because you are changing the rules of showing numbers which is defined in math and it is not something you can just say lets use this way to see it better.besides you are not talking about a community of small number of people, you should think globally. all over the world people want to see this number and adding a "","" after the decimal point is only confusing. there are still many people who don't even know m=10e-3 and u=10e-6 which is pretty common and obvious, so adding a new thing that is also wrong will only create further confusion.

### Reply 1:
Not personally. If I did then it would go straight back. It might be someone's abortion fund for all I know. By the sounds of it it happens when people have addresses stored and send to one from a previous transaction.

### Reply 2:
Someone sending to the wrong address is rare and never happened to me. But what I experienced, and I believe is much more common are small Bitcoin amounts around 0.0001 BTC which are sometimes send to many random addresses. For those curious, there is sometimes message on blockchain.info - probably promoting ponzi site (at least this happened to me few times).

Topic: A Science Fiction story idea: Using Bitcoin for ransom
### Original post:
Years ago, a friend of mine who was an actor and writer told me, Never rob a bank, instead write about it. That idea that dangerous activities could be explored trhough fiction has stuck with me. I myself would never break any laws or engage in any activity which was meant to harm anyone, or cause harm to their person or property. Despite that, it is always interesting to speculate. For example, who hasn't sat around with friends, and tried to come up with cool band names, or speculated on what they would do if they won the lottery. And, who hasn't had that most horrible and vulgar speculatvie conversation about how you would dispose of a dead body. Now, just because you sit around and speculate on such morbid thoughts doesn't mean you actually wold kill anyone. It is like talking about what you would do if you were Alexander the Great, or playing some multi-player role playing game in which you kill other players or their avatars.So there I was, thinking about naughty uses for bitcoin. And, as everyone who has ever watched thousands of hours of NCIS and Law and Order re-runs on Hulu+, the biggest danger in kidnapping someone, the place in the process where the kidnapper is most vu<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Why would they risk doing the kidnapping if they already had a nice lump of BTC?Why would they not just send the BTC's trough some mixing services and split it up into small wallets?They could also do some buying and selling of other cryptos to hide their tracks even more. Imagine using BTC to buy BBQ coins and then exchanging the BBQ coins for some Chinacoin before changing the chinacoin etc and in the end buy BTC again and selling for USD.

### Reply 2:
There is no need, use a mixer service to mix the BTC, then give out 5% to random people, then wait some time to spend the rest. So even ifthere are investigators tracking the movement of BTC (probably a unfruitful endeavor after the btc are mixed), they will be led on a wild goose chase and will give up.

Anyone can point me to data about BTC asset distribution (ex. a list of the 100 ""fattest"" wallets in a given time) and income distribution (ex. a list of the wallets who received more in a given time)?The ideal would be some graphic representation of the total BTC distributions in different times (even if I figure how misleading such data could be, given that every user has a random numbers of wallets).I ask because it could be interesting to see if such distributions are more or less egualitarian than fiat monies', and if their concentration seem to increase or decrease in time.Given the number of ""big swinging dicks"" so much capitalized on the GLBSE, and even due to other factors (like a couple of millions of ""sleeping"" BTC), I would not be surprised at all to find some extremely unequal distribution.

We really can't be bothered any more than we already are with China and her ill decision concerning Bitcoin. The world had moved on without China and it should remain like that after the first ban.

I hope people do know that this isn't just present in Crypto, insider trading is something that is grossly common across all types of securities and investments. Cause when there's money to be made, there are going to be ways to make it illegally -- happens all the time. Though, this isn't me trying to say it's OK -- I'm just saying that this was bound to happen as it happens in stocks, and of course is going to happen in crypto too.Regulations won't stop this, this is just incompetence by the government.

This thread is a simple one. The bitcoin community welcomes all newcomers (minus paid fud trolls).When you first step into the bitcoin realm it can be intimidating... please consider that this is a family of geeks and investors... not always of mindset of keeping it simple... yet the bitcoin train is one crazy and exciting ride... don't give up.One thing you will learn is that there are always folks willing to help you understand and you should not be embarrassed to ELI5 (explain like I'm 5).Seriously, this is a completely addictive hobby that has far reaching financial impact personally & globally... the more you learn the more you want to be involved in this disruptive revolution... we were all nubes at one time. Hopefully our long term brainiacs can realize the importance of adoption and tone down the elitist attitude.Sooooo... welcome aboard... jump in... the water is warm... the tide is rising and the surf is incredible! What got you interested... and how can we help you better understand the real Satoshi's dream... Questions or comments?

### Reply 1:
We need more of this attitude around here. Less hassling new guys. Less elitism. Less sniping out people for their opinions.I agree with the OP...this can be a friendly place, welcome!

Topic: Bitcoin Mining , Is it worth it?
### Original post:
Hello guys, I have a friend who told me about BITCOIN MINING. What do you think? Is it worth it ? Buying Hardwares / Mining Rigs and plus the TIME to be consume.I'm not even familiar with it , so I'm probably asking for advice on for those old miners.Electricity here in PH is so expensive. Do you have some tips and tricks? Thanks in advance guys !

### Reply 1:
It is not a good idea to do it now. There is a lot of competition happening and the difficulty gets higher.If you really are into mining then better look for another coin. But I bet there will be more out there considering popularity are in the hands of the ICO's now. They have their own number of coins and there is no mining needed.You will need a lot of capital for this to be successful.

### Reply 2:
Everyone has his own experience and his point of view, but it really does not look profitable and effective. Mining really needs a lot of capital to buy powerful equipment, and you will not get a quick profit. But if you have extra money, then why not try it.

### Original post:
<link> I'm Sorry. I believed I could do this. I believed that I could put years of anonymity and hiding behind me. But, as the events of this week unfolded and I prepared to publish the proof of access to the earliest keys, I broke. I do not have the courage. I cannot.When the rumors began, my qualifications and character were attacked. When those allegations were proven false, new allegations have already begun. I know now that I am not strong enough for this.I know that his weakness will cause great damage to those that have supported me, and particularly to Jon Matonis and Gavin Anderson. I can only hope that their honour and credibility is not irreparably tainted by my actions. They were not deceived, but I know that the world will never believe that now. I can only say I'm sorry.And goodbye.

Topic: Blockchain question for Bitcointalk
### Original post:
Are mutable blockchains, blockchains or databases?What makes a blockchain ""a blockchain"", and what makes ""a blockchain"" a database? Is there a technical answer to it, or is it philosophical?I have read/listened to many debates about it, but it never arrived to a ""correct answer"". Is there an actual correct answer?

### Reply 1:
In principle, Blockchain is repository of information that is distributed, permissionless, immutable and transparent, with inherent redundancy and cryptographic security by design. The core value that it provides is transparency and immutability, from which trust is derived. Now if we make the blockchain mutable, as I see it, it breaks the trust value, making it ""another thing"". That does not convert it into a Database, at least in the traditional sense, since it still lacks the essential properties of requiring permissions and admin, being generally centralized, speed per physical TX, and so forth.A mutable Blockchain seems to be in no mans land, closer to Blockchain by design, but lacking to meet the core values that one expects on a Blockchain.

### Reply 2:
The main feature of blockchain is that blocks are linked together via hashing and pointing to the previous block. Blockchain is definitely a data structure, it even has some similarities to a linked list, but calling it a database is a question of semantics. For example, Bitcoin uses Google's LevelDB internally, so you could argue that blockchain is not a self-sufficient database software akin to MySQL.

Topic: Why most people believe bitcoin to be worthless?
### Original post:
most people think that ""No useful Dapp or any sort of business based on bitcoin or crypto in general that is making a decent amount of revenue except for exchanges and mining hardware companies.!""If you have to debate with someone about the ""real"" value of bitcoin. rather than people buying it to sell it for more fiat , what are the proper arguments that you have to use ?people have already built this kind of immune system against the benefits of Decentralization which is bitcoin strongest weapon.i mean the average person does not really care about centralization, more than 90% of the world's population, go to work early morning, go home in the evening, get paid by the end of the month and really do not give a fudge whether their money is sitting at the bank or an Exodus wallet as long as they get to spend it.that average person would buy into a new idea if it has something of a direct change on his life style, i mean if you were to invent a cheap flying car then the whole world would want to have it.I was trying to promote bitcoin to one of my friends, and he did not seem to be impressed at all, a while later another friend of ours talked about this new product that you can apply <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Yes, Bitcoin might be dropping its current price but is normal in a crypto, but I do not believe Bitcoin is useless, he's still the king and will remain the number one.

### Reply 2:
i don't know why you think people think like that! they really don't.there are two groups of people in my opinion.1. those who don't know about bitcoin or don't understand it. these people don't have any opinion about bitcoins ""worth"". they either don't care or they are always surprised and find the price weird. they don't say things such as ""bitcoin is worthless""!!!2. those who know about bitcoin and understand the potential of it.these people are the ones buying bitcoin. but some of them who want to buy it cheaper always spread FUD about how it is ""worthless"" because they want others to not-buy while they buy cheaper bitcoins.

Topic: what if bitcoin becomes inferior
### Original post:
I looked for traces of Satoshi on the Internet. I've read all of his posts since 2009. He is sublime. If you read his writing, you can feel his passion. I have a little bit of bitcoin. I'm pretty relieved just to have Bitcoin. But if you look back at history.. Yahoo lost to Google. Yahoo was great, but Google was even better. Satoshi gave us a gift called Bitcoin without any greed and went somewhere. The problem is, new geniuses are born all the time, and technology advances. Bitcoin is not physics. It's blockchain technology. Which means that bitcoin is not an immutable law. A better technology than Bitcoin could emerge. What should we do if someone gives us a better system than bitcoin as a gift and leaves? It performs better than Bitcoin, and it even has the perfect decentralization of Bitcoin, which we value highly. Bitcoin was created in 2009, and now it's 2023. Cars made in 2009 cannot be better than cars made in 2023 or later. What if someone with as much genius and passion as Satoshi is creating a system better than Bitcoin?

### Reply 1:
Technologies involve every time and new developments always come up from time to time, and if it is a good technical, then the world will welcome it and it is as a compliment to what we already have that be it so I don't see any threat to bitcoin if there be any feature successful development that plays the role as bitcoin since we already have some alternatives currencies already. Google did not replace Yahoo but then both are playing there vital unique roles, it all depends on how you the user take them at per time and how you chose to use them and when to also use them.

### Reply 2:
Bitcoin has a network effect which the other coins will never achieve to get. In the early years of crypto, it was easier to create a natural coin distribution via mining but now it is impossible because everybody knows about crypto. Big miners will capitalize the new projects leave nothing to the average people. Bitcoin is unique that way because when bitcoin came to surface, most people couldn't understand what it is about. Some people sold their stash as soon as they they doubled their money. No other coin will have the same natural history like bitcoin. Also remember, bitcoin is a software. It gets updates every once in a while so when a new idea appears, btc will use it as well. No need to worry about it.

Topic: Why can't a private key be calculated from its address?
### Original post:
If computers can calculate an address from its private key, then why can't they do the reverse and calculate a private key from an address?

### Reply 1:
Not all calculations are reversible. Suppose private keys and address work like this: private keys are long numbers, and addresses are the sum of all digits. Obviously a simplification, but just as an example.So if you have private key = 134505719542, then you can easily calculate the address: <truncated> = 46.Now I have another address: 43. What's the private key?

### Reply 2:
Any number of which the digits' sum is 43?I don' think your example really explains why a btc private key (actually, as far as I know each address has something like 2^100 private keys), can't be calculated from the address.

In the age of high-frequency trading, the time honored equilibrium in the feedback loop of pursuit, capture and escape is becoming increasingly distorted.Long and arduous is the process by which financial regulation is conceived and implemented, taking on the order of months to fully realize.This is a classical procedure which traces its roots back to an age where commodities crossed the Atlantic on schooners and the code of conduct was scrawled out longhand with quill pens. In those days of yore, if legislation contained a failure or loophole it could be exploited only so many times before it was possible to stem the breach.Our digital age is described by, among other things, adaptive machine learning processes that are capable of executing transactions in fractions of a second. As such, while the time horizon during which legislative oversights might remain vulnerable has generally remained constant, our ability to exploit them has increased by a degree previously unimaginable.

Topic: Continues integration used for mining
### Original post:
Some of you may be aware of ""continues integration"" approach in software development. One of tool used for that could be - for example - GitHub Actions. Server takes software code and launches build, tests etc, to see if new development did not break anything. That's theory. What if someone would add ""one more extra task"" to be performed on the server side?The Sysdig Threat Research Team (Sysdig TRT) recently uncovered an extensive and sophisticated active cryptomining operation and called that PURPLEURCHIN - more details there: <link>

### Reply 1:
That's quite interesting and as long as none of the service providers offers free resources, that threat can't survive for a long time... The same blog post also mentioned the possibility of a 51% attack on Bitcoin and even if they remain undetected for some time, I wouldn't be worried.

Bitcoin finally set foot on the mainstream, in the form of a currency option in Microsoft Excel. There are a number of barriers one has to overcome to become a real trend. And Bitcoin has overcome this challenge during the past 10 years. Finally, Microsoft added this crypto currency to its system, in the form of a currency option in Excel office software.Microsoft has long placed great emphasis on the pre-coding market. The world's leading software group has announced it will implement an ambitious strategy, directly cooperating with prominent Blockchain projects such as Ethereum, R3, AntShares, ...What do you think?

### Reply 1:
It could have be nice if there's a link to that information for verification. That apart, this is what we are waiting for, that big companies like Microsoft, FaceBook, Google and Amazon should embrace the reality on ground under the cover of cryptocurrency. They admitting that Bitcoin is a currency will make things work easily very soon for Bitcoin.

### Reply 2:
That is indeed a great News. News related to Bitcoin adoption always bring cheers to the market. I did read this article four days back. The link to the article - <link> is a new addition to the currency symbol in excel. Now the path for Bitcoin to go mainstream has opened and already started, as Excel is one of the most used Software from Microsoft's office edition. Good news for traders, it will easy to maintain records now. I wonder when will Google add Bitcoin to Google sheets?

Topic: My little research.
### Original post:
I haven't been here for long but I have taken my time to read through some of the important conceptions about Bitcoin, and with my little knowledge, I really know that Bitcoin is a good means of investment if I can hold it from now till dear life.I have done a little research about Bitcoin and why some governments refuse to accept Bitcoin in their own country even when they know that they are in power to make the most important citizens in their country access it and take advantage of it, and it wonders me a little.However, Bitcoin is a risky means of investment and it is not something that investors should be in a rush to sell. I am just saying this out of my own ideas based on my slight research.I have a little business that I am doing so far, and I would like to accept Bitcoin in my business, but I don't have enough ideas about Bitcoin. That's why I want to learn more, but truth be told, it's good to practice while learning.While learning about Bitcoin, I will have to practice it little by little with the little money that I can afford.

### Reply 1:
Do you mean that you want to make a breakthrough in business, for example accepting BTC as payment in your business?If that is the purpose of your discussion, perhaps you need to study more deeply and consider your decision properly. This may be detrimental to you if you receive payments in the form of BTC. BTC is very volatile, maybe you need help from a third party as a service that converts BTC to USD.However, if you really intend to accept BTC in full as an investment goal, that's no problem, the decision is all in your hands. Bitcoin is indeed feasible if used as a long-term investment. Even though the price falls, Bitcoin is also able to rise again and sometimes exceeds the initial price we bought BTC.

Dear all, A while back, my work email address was used with a whole load of others from my workplace to set up fake accounts on Ashley Madison, which were then dumped in the recent, infamous hack of that site.I'd checked my address on I've Been Pwned after a friend advised me to when the scandal broke and found my email on it; I told my IT section at work and my boss, reported it to the police, etc.I then received a blackmail email some time later (as you'd kind of expect) demanding I pay Bitcoins into a Bitcoin account. I've again reported this to the cybercrime lot of the local Police, my IT department etc but the use of a bitcoin account intrigued me.I've read a bit about bitcoin and have a vague idea how it works but really I'm a complete ignoramus; I thought it might be interesting to post on this forum with the bitcoin number the blackmailer sent me - <truncated> and see if it's possible to track down who this might belong to.I realize this might be a silly question but I do love looking into things, so please forgive me naivety if this sounds stupid to you...Any info advice gratefully received!Thanks!

It is very unlikely that you will be able to trace anything through that number as they probably generate a new number for every mail they send. Unless they then send it to a very obvious collection address, which I doubt, you won't be able to track it if they use a mixer for instance.

Topic: Disadvantages of Bitcoin
### Original post:
This is a saying we all know "" Everything that has an advantage also has a disadvantage ""I brought up this topic so we all can discuss on the disadvantage part of BitcoinAlthough this topic was already here about 4 years ago but it was about advantages and disadvantages of investing in Bitcoin<link> nobody seems to really talk about the disadvantagesDo we know that the anonymity of bitcoin is a problem?Let's all think about thisSome of us here do day to day transactions and we know that our identities are not known, and since our identities are not know some use that as an opportunity to purchase illegal stuffs and and do illegal things because we are safe with the knowledge ""The don't know our identity"" We can look into this article for more explanations <link>

### Reply 1:
Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general?For bitcoin, one of the biggest weakness is that its scalability. When it first came out, it takes a mere split second to make a transaction. Right now, it takes hours for the same task. As more people make bitcoin transactions on the network this wait time is only going to increase.There is a team right now trying to speed things up by developing a Lightning Network. However, this is currently still in the works and while its technically usable right now, you might actually lose your bitcoin if not done properly.

### Reply 2:
Fun fact: Bitcoin isn't even anonymous, only pseudo-anonymous. There's a significant difference.And the good ol' ""buying illegal stuff"" part. Bitcoin is money, and money is a tool. People will always use whatever tool or technology for nefarious stuff.e.g.Hammers and crowbars for killing peopleCars and motorcycles to be used as getaway vehiclesSocial media to stalk peopleThe internet in general to steal money and identitiesThe U.S. Dollar to buy illegal drugs and to pay for hitmenand the list goes on and on and on..

Shouldn't we worried about upcoming dumps from them? (dumps made for the sake of getting profits?). I think such large investments are going to be terrific for small and individual investors. Please correct me if I am wrong.

### Reply 2:
market has grown constantly in the last years and this is just a sort of ""natural evolution"" .it's just matter of size since nowadays these big players are investing in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies too.the same since the market is big enough, it's very hard make a massive dump since other investors will buy immediately your coins.

Topic: New Stimulus Bill Rejected- Good News For Bitcoin..
### Original post:
The United States Senate just rejected the most recent stimulus proposal which did not have any plans to include another $1,200 dollar check to individual citizens. I didn't really think much about the correlation between the stimulus checks and the price of bitcoin going up until I read this article by cointelegraph. <link> the bill was rejected in what looks like could be in large part because it did not include another round of $1200 checks, means it's very possible it will be included in the next proposed bill, and therefore another chance for a boost in the arm to bitcoin as it's likely much of these checks will go to buying bitcoin again as they did before.There is even proof behind this correlation, as pointed out by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong ( I've decided to post this despite that fact that I think Brian is a sleazy scumbag who engages in illegal activities in order to make himself and his company wealthy in terms of freezing his exchange and using it to his advantage when there was very little to no oversight of his company).

### Reply 1:
Can anyone explain why the $1,200 check wasn't included and what are the chances that it will be included in the next proposal? Will they be printing more fiat to distribute another round of $1,200s? If so, it's like saying the market needs more fiat to pump bitcoin.

### Reply 2:
It's going to be a disaster really in a matter of months or years at last. And if that isn't bad enough, the entire world's economy will be affected by it. On the other hand, I guess it's great that at least we're some of the few who've locked in a quite safe position.. safer than fiat anyway, considering all the events.

Topic: 41% of people globally say they trust Bitcoin over local currencies
### Original post:
Premise (a crowdsourced insights company) reported in a press release that 41% of respondents consider Bitcoin to be more reliable than their own local currencies. Principally due to the decentralized aspect of the blockchain tech. Wow! Are people realizing what decentralization is about and the garbage behind central banks and co? If that's the case, I'm quite surprised seeing all the low information voters.The survey has interviewed 11 000 participants and is not closed yet. It started 2-3 months ago26% of respondents said they would rather use Bitcoin than their local currency.<link>

### Reply 1:
Yes, As far I know near around 100 million people around the world are known about cryptocurrency properly. Regular Crypto users are far less than that number. Till now more than 25% of American citizens don't know what is cryptocurrency and how to use it!!So, Such a huge(41%) respondent is really great, that means most of the people didn't use cryptocurrency but they hear about it and know the functionalities of blockchain technology that's why they support Bitcoin over their local currencies. I believe that by 2025 there will be a revolution in the use of currency in the world and Bitcoin will be more developed and adopted by govt phase.

### Reply 2:
Regardless of the source of the numbers mentioned here in the picture, I'm not sure about these numbers because these numbers seem way higher than reality to me, still, there are many people who don't even know about bitcoin even in America if the situation is like that in a country like America then there is even worst situation in the other countries and other are still many people they don't know bitcoin or they partly know about bitcoin as a currency, then how can we ask them if they really trust something they don't even understand completely.

### Reply 1:
It feels a bit gimmicky really, maybe the President is looting all the riches from the country while pretending that Bitcoin is somehow a savior. Apparently the current President is quite young and popular, but how many times have we seen those sort of people turn into dictators when enough power comes to their heads. Latching on to a cryptocurrency might produce a few short term favorable headlines, but it does very little to change the underlying poor economic state of the country. People need jobs before they can accrue enough money to save and they need things like stable internet access before they can reliably hold bitcoin, maybe the politicians should focus on these basics before trying to get all techy.

### Reply 2:
That's the same thing in my country during the news segment in a channel, they display the exchange rate of different currency and I don't think that we have to change anything about it because they will probably do the same thing with it.

Topic: Mining, Pools, and voting on the future of bitcoin
### Original post:
The discussion in the mining forum and the upcoming transition to support p2sh is very interesting. As a miner, you have a vote on such changes to the bitcoin protocol. Your vote is proportional to the amount of mining capacity you control. The mining pools are being asking to voice which of the proposals for p2sh they support by stating their preference in the blocks the create. This got me thinkingas a pool operator, taking a position could be risky. Miners in your pool that don't agree with your position might leave for another pool that was inline with their position. So, one thing the pools could do is divide up their operations such that the miners could connect to one of several servers, each of which takes a different position on the issue at hand. This lets the individual miners register their votes however they wish and they don't have to jump to another pool. Good for the miners and good for the pool operator.In the future, I would love to see mining hardware sold as a little solid state brick device for less than $100. Just about everyone could run these miners to help secure the network and ensure they have a vote in its future direction. Pools could make it simple for<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
If you belong to a pool, the pool will be putting a vote into the blocks it finds (well, most pools will). You could think of the pool as being your representative for the purposes of voting on the protocol upgrade. If you mine solo, each block you find is effectively is a non vote and may hinder the rollout of either solution (because a super majority of mining capacity is needed before the change will go forward).

### Reply 2:
This is a huge issue right now. The first step is for everyone to stop using at least the top 3 biggest pools which are Deepbit, Slush and Guild. I know that not everyone will stop of course, but if enough of you do, we have at least limited the massive power they have over decisions right now.The other step is to simply raise awareness among miners and pool operators. Miners need to consult their pool operator to find out what he/she is voting for and then change pool if you dislike the pool operators opinion. Of course with p2pool anyone can vote for themselves but it's not necessary for everyone to use p2pool. It's VERY necessary however that we limit the power of the largest pools and start thinking about our votes.For example I have mined at Bitlc.net (former Bitcoins.lc) for a long time now but I have no clue what the pool operator is thinking in regards to P2SH. When the voting period is on I will certainly want to know if the pool has the same opinion as I do, if it doesn't I will change my pool.

That. What's the benefit of pegging your Lightning balance to USD? And how exactly is this supposed to work? Like, creating 1 L-USD for each 3,000 Lightning sats? Doesn't make any sense. Bitcoin is free money; a currency on its own. And so is USD. Whoever wants to switch, utilize trading. Reminds me of something. What can have possibly happened to that old soul, nullius, I wonder.

It sounds like USDT, but running on the Lightning Network. The ""tokens"" can be non-custodial, but the dollar peg can only be centralized.

### Reply 1:
There are some very strict rules regarding landfill and recycling centres in the UK. The land is owned by a local council and they will NEVER let a member of the public go looking through any rubbish. Imagine someone going rummaging and they manage to get a used syringe needle stuck into themselves - this person could then easily sue the council. This man unfortunately, will NEVER have any chance of getting his hard drive back

### Reply 2:
I seriously doubt that the data will still be there to be retrieved, because under ideal conditions, hard drives are predicted to be able to retain their data for 9 to 20 years. So I should say... a landfill are less than ideal conditions and his hard drive has been there for almost 8 years now. We have not even consider that corrosive fluids will hasten the deterioration of the physical disc and also rust and the pressure that was placed on this hard drive with material that was placed on top of it.

Topic: Whatever happens, hold on to your Bitcoin.
### Original post:
There is growing excitement in the Bitcoin community following the gains recorded by Bitcoin. The reason for this growth is hardly unconnected to rumors of Bitcoin ETF approval. Have we thought about what will happen to Bitcoin price should all the ETF get rejected? I don't want to imagine this but whatever happens, hold on to your Bitcoin. There have been bull run without Bitcoin ETF and there will always be bull run even if the ETF is rejected. So even when the market temporarily nosedives if the ETF is rejected, do not panic. Once again, hold on to your Bitcoin and do not panic.

### Reply 1:
People get too excited about small pumps in the market, it brings the idea of the time to sell and make profit is at hand but, what becomes of you and the fiat or whatever coin/commodity your Bitcoin values is transferred into after you sell?You might just miss out of all the other events, bear market inclusive, which will come playing out after that.Many have the ideas of, they would have to buy again during the bears but, how often do you make it to that.Anyway, after the rain comes the shine and as such, being excited isnt out of place but, never get to sell all your coins.News on the continued approval of various ETF platforms might be a course for nothing but, I very much feel this is just happening as a bid by this platforms to actually take advantage of the expected bullrun, come next halving. You get to work with them to build yourself and them as well. Its a cool thing but, ensure your not loosing out on accumulating some Bitcoins.

### Reply 2:
I'm sure many are feeling good about the gains made by Bitcoin recently, but I think that holding Bitcoin no matter what is not a great strategy. If someone invested a long time ago, the current price might be good for that person to sell. Or, maybe a person wants to keep hodling but sell just a bit to enjoy the profits made due to recent gains. I think it's totally fine, and it is important to actually benefit from the profits once in a while. I agree that Bitcoin will probably rise with or without an ETF approval, but it can easily happen after another year of a bear market, for instance, so if someone wants to sell a bit now, it makes sense.

Topic: is bitcoin scalability problem solve now?
### Original post:
In 2017 there was the last civil war in bitcoin. This civil war gave rise to the hard fork to whom that gave birth to bitcoin cash. The reason for the war is because of bitcoin scalability. One part of the network wanted the fork that will make bitcoin have upto 200 and above TPS. But the order part of the network believe that if the change is apply it will lead to centralization of bitcoin. The result is bitcoin cash from bitcoin. Some week after the civil war. Pieter Wuille came out with segregated witness. But this one is soft fork. What seg wit did is to technically increase 1mb size of bitcoin block to 4mb. He did this by separating the bitcoin signature data from transaction data. So that there we be more space in the block to accept more transaction. The reason for this soft fork is to solve the scalability too.Lightening network has be there before the 2017 war. But is adopting slowly. The Lightening network use second layer bitcoin protocol to process transaction fast and small transaction fees. This one is design to happen not on the blockchain but will be add to the blockchain after transaction. The reason for this too is to solve the scalability. On november this year. <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Wrong. Signatures are still very much part of each transaction and are included in each block.The reason for SegWit soft-fork was many things (malleability fix, opening room for easy future deployment of new soft forks, ...), one of which was scaling.That is Schnorr signatures, Taproot is a lot more than that. There is already a lot of topics about it so I won't start explaining here.Same with SegWit (witness version 0) this is doing a lot more than just scaling.Scalability is not something you just solve once and be done with it. It is something you have to keep improving based on new development in technology and hardware.

### Reply 2:
Signatures are the important part of the transactions, which means they cannot be thrown away because if it were otherwise we would end up with the whole bunch of transactions that could be spent by literally anyone in the network. Segwit doesn't separate signature data from transaction data, it simply moves actual signature data and other data that is used to verify a transaction (aka ""witness data"") to a special part of a transaction called ""witness."" Non-SegWit nodes don't know that this special field of SegWit transaction even exists, but they still consider these transactions valid if miners that had upgraded to SegWit included them in a block. So, in SegWit the actual signature data remains a part of the transaction, but it is not visible for older nodes. The fact that these non-upgraded nodes don't see witness data along with other data in transactions gives people an illusion that this data is somehow ""separated"" while in reality, it is not.

### Reply 1:
Aren't media outlets in China owned by the government? If that's the case, this means that the Chinese are softening up for bitcoin and could potentially issue yet another statement regarding their support for bitcoin and other related services. Or it could just be another statement to piss off the Americans, knowing that the USD has been pretty much weakening as days are passing by. Either way, the Chinese are planning to get involved by prepping up the media, and releasing such statements just helps with that.

Bitcoins status as a hedge against uncertainty also gains further significance when compared with the performance of mainstream haven assets like gold, and currencies like the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen.

Topic: Bitcoin are not by nature money, but money consists by its nature of bitcoin？
### Original post:
Marx mentioned in ""A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy""1. ""Gold and silver are not by nature money"" means that gold and silver are not inherently currency. Because gold and silver first appeared in the market as a general commodity, only when the commodity exchange developed to a certain historical stage, a fixed commodity of equivalent value was needed as a medium of exchange, called general equivalent, when the general equivalent was concentrated on gold and silver. When gold and silver are fixedly used as general equivalents, it is currency. Because gold and silver do not become currency as soon as they come to the world.2. ""money consists by its nature of gold and silver"", which means that money should be born of gold and silver, or that gold and silver are born with the excellent characteristics of being currency, which is determined by the natural properties of gold and silver.So can we deduce the process of Bitcoin becoming a general equivalent from the process of gold and silver becoming a general equivalent?1.gold was very valuable in ancient times.The ancient smelting technology is relatively poor, and it is impossible to make copper, iron and other metals<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
This is the mission of Bitcoin, but to be honest, its better to call it digital thing. It is not a general equivalentMaybe the definition of finance is a little bit different from what we understand. I need to study the intrinsic value you mentioned.There seems to be no necessary connection between the two. The current currency has no intrinsic value, but serves as a general equivalent.It is indeed a good asset.Yes, it is not difficult if you want to learn Bitcoin. Just like people use online shopping, you dont need to learn the basics of the Internet, you just need to use it.

### Reply 2:
Bitcoin is an electronic money created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. ... Unlike currencies in general, bitcoin does not depend on trusting the main issuer. bitcoin can be used for anything, because the value of bitcoin is so fantastic, in the end most bitcoins are used as assets to invest, because if we are patient we will definitely profit what we get can be 2 times the price we buy,

Topic: Retail users out?
### Original post:
After tested to max. pain limit during last 3 months and continuously suffering financially and mentally, I think the retail users have given up. If so, this is not good scenario. If soon there are no new & much positive vibes in the market, the things can go lower. Is not?? But my point of view is that in the highly sophisticated and versatile market there is a clause who stand till end will grow with market growth.

### Reply 1:
Retail users already out, this is why the price was fall... if they aren't out it won't hit $35K. They're scared of the market and can't relax, definitely they will sell in loss. After that, when the market recovered and the price back to $50K they will join again and buy with higher price.The thing is there're so many articles create bad news about Bitcoin while the fact it's a old news or unrelated, but many people believe it.

### Reply 2:
How do you really know, though? Having several weeks of red doesn't automatically mean that they're totally out. Also taking into consideration that a good chunk of money in bitcoin is still retail; if they were really totally out, we'd be far lower from here. (not saying retail needs to be out for us to have a bounce btw)

Topic: The big picture they've all been missing
### Original post:
First of all let me make this point clear: There's no Cryptos without BitcoinThe space largely has two main sides: the tech, blockchain and the money, cryptos. We have all been seeing various projects develop and some are as dumb as saying they'll kill Bitcoin lol. It can't happen (at least now that Bitcoin controls way more than 10+% of the market)So what all these new projects need to focus on is make sure to promote Bitcoin first. I say so because it is the bigger picture, and the hard truth.Come to think of it, What type of news didn't we hear about Ripple last year??? But Ripple nearly tumbled until the recent Bitcoin gains helped out. As for fake satoshi, hehee.... his story is funny!! trying to kill Bitcoin??? lol.. that's the dumbest thing to do, and now look at his coin lolHonestly, the mainstream valuate the whole space by the metrics of Bitcoin and so if you're a developer building anything and seeking mainstream adoption (which we definitely need), then you need to always promote BitcoinSo in a nutshell, the logic is that, as Bitcoin grows, we all grow together in untiy and strength because Bitcoin is what binds crypto and blockchain mainstream adoption.So let's stop th<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
You are correct mate bitcoin is the beggining of all no one can replace or kill it, those are just trying hard to promote their projects like example those forks saying they are the real bitcoin in fact there is only one with ""BTC"" Ticker. Blockchain is slowly growing and the birth of new altcoins is growing too. Big companies, Banks and merchant is slowly adapting too cryptocurrency will play a big part in the future.

### Reply 2:
All crypto requires Bitcoin, why? the logic is that every crypto made through ICO or IPO sales is bought with bitcoin or ethereum. But most people prefer bitcoin to save their funds, so the bitcoin network will never go out. Even though prices tend to go up and down, I'm sure it's part of the dynamics to keep bitcoin alive.

Over the last eight years, U.S. law enforcement has seized a great number of bitcoins and at one time, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) held one of the largest bitcoin wallets after the Silk Road takedown. A recently published report shows the FBI has started using cryptocurrency mixing applications in recent times in order to obfuscate transactions from seized bitcoins that stem from a forfeiture.Source: <link> would they do that? Arrested person from doing criminal activities do that, so why do they? No transparency is a corrupted system.

### Reply 1:
Thank you for pointing out that it is not the real bitcoin but from the fake one. Still we cannot ignore the fact that FBI are shady agency that confiscate cryptocurrencies and not all of them are being presented as evidences. Heres a merit.

### Reply 2:
It is strange to see them making use of services that have been due illegal. Probably they are also making sure they destroy evidence get tracked. It is just like you do not believe in a process but you are making use of the process. For you, it is right but for other it is not. This exactly the reason why many do not like a centralized system of governance. You are only right in your own way.

Topic: Will my Ledger Nano replace my Metamask wallet or will they work hand-in-hand?
### Original post:
Hi all,Got some newbie questions related to hardware wallet here.I just bought some BEP-20 tokens during their ICO through their website to which my Metamask wallet is connected to.Also, I just placed an order for Ledger Nano S Plus. I'm just trying to imagine how this will fit in for these BEP-20 tokens and also for subsequent holdings of cryptocurrency.(1) After I receive my Ledger Nano, will it replace Metamask wallet entirely, or will it be used in conjunction with it? Do I need to transfer whatever tokens I have in Metamask to the Ledger Nano? If it is more like an integration, will they be maintaining 2 different public addresses or just one?(2) Can those newly launched ERC-20/BEP-20 tokens show up in Ledger Nano wallet? Or I have to just buy/hold those newly launched tokens using Metamask wallet, and only transfer to Ledger when they become supported?(3) Will the process of buying tokens during ICO be different after I switch to using Ledger Nano? Or will it still be the same, i.e., just go to the site and connect using Metamask wallet (perhaps with hardware wallet also plugged <truncated>

### Reply 1:
(1) When you created Metamask wallet, you had seed phrases. When you receive Ledger Nano, you will create a new wallet in it, for which a new seed phrase will be generated. These are completely different seed phrases, which means different wallets.Of course, tokens need to be transferred from Metamask wallet to Ledger wallet. Otherwise, why would you buy ardware wallet at all. But not directly, but after you connect Ledger wallet to Metamask and generate a new public address to which you send your tokens.(2) Its better for you to buy and hold these new tokens on Metamask (not the first one Metamask wallet), but the second one, which you will create by connecting Ledger device. I assume you will be able to transfer as soon as it is supported.(3) Everything will be exactly the same. If you connect with Metamask, you may not need a Ledger device, because this device is only needed to confirm outgoing transactions, and in your case, it will be an incoming transaction.

### Reply 2:
The same answer pretty much applies to all three questions: It can replace it, but it's probably best to use them together, Ledger Live (ledger's software) doesn't support all tokens/networks. So you need to send all of your funds from MetaMask to Ledger device, and then link the MetaMask with Ledger[1] so when you're using dapps, you want to receive funds, etc. you would just do that from MetaMask, and when you want to send funds, you can also use MetaMask, but you would still need to authorize payments from the Ledger device.[1] <link>

If it so happens that he actually will soon gain control over more than a million BTC, let him sell. Sure, the price will likely drop by a lot, but I only see that as a buy opportunity. Bitcoin will rise back up as quickly as it dropped. In the long term, it's nothing but a small blip on the price charts.

### Reply 2:
Take it easy, mate! On the contrary, if he is the real Satoshi, he would not even be entertaining the thought of selling it. I have a strong feeling that Satoshi was not cocky, very much unlike this Craig Wright. I don't think Satoshi would just let his creation crumble to the ground just to prove his real identity. Satoshi was a genius, not a moron.

Topic: How do you accept Bitcoin donations on Facebook and other sites?
### Original post:
Sorry for the newb question but I couldn't find it in a websearch.I'm making a documentary about positive open source systems for the future, and want to include a section about Bitcoin. We want to accept Bitcoin donations on Facebook, and have a place where people can donate.We know a bit about film but not too much about computers, and were looking for a step by step guide on how to install a donate button, especially on Facebook.If there's a guide somewhere please let us know...And we'll let you know once the trailer is online...Thx

### Reply 1:
I've got half a brain on me, speak a few languages, play music, know how to edit film etc... but if there isn't an idiots guide on how to do these things I get lost. We're releasing in under a week so there's a bit of pressure.We'll use another site in the meantime if there's nothing easy from BC.I saw a discussion on an easy to install Facebook app, but there was disagreement on which was the best.Hope we can raise your profile.Thanks for the prompt reply and I'll check the thread. Peace

Topic: Have a clear understanding of what DCA means
### Original post:
Hello! I'd like to seize this moment to offer my insights on the Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy, aiming to clarify its concept and its intended purpose for those who may still find it unclear.DCA involves consistently investing smaller, equal amounts over time, as opposed to making large, irregular crypto purchases. Think of it as making payments for a product in installments, at regular intervals, until the total is paid off. When you regularly invest in your preferred cryptocurrencies, you automatically accumulate more assets over time, regardless of market fluctuations. This can help you grow your holdings and potentially reduce your overall average cost during market dips. In contrast, a lump sum payment is a one-time investment, the opposite of DCA.Let's delve into how DCA operates:Imagine the current price of BTC is $20,000, and you're a high-earning individual looking to invest in this asset. If you make a lump sum investment, you would acquire one BTC at a cost of $20,000.However, with DCA, you spread that $20,000 across five equal $4,000 purchases, resulting in costs of $20,000/BTC, $15,000/BTC, $5,000/BTC, $5,000/BTC, and $25,000/BTC. This approach yields an average<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
You can technically do it like this and twist the strategy in whatever way you want, but the main purpose of DCA is to just buy an equal amount every time, to eliminate the <truncated> factor of markets. Changing the amounts every time kind of defeats the purpose of doing DCA.

### Reply 2:
These are nuances. What is classically called DCA, pure DCA, would be buying the same quantities at the same time intervals. If it is not so exact but we can buy more depending on the available money or we vary the intervals depending on the availability (and we buy an extra amount for example on the day we receive a bonus) it would already be a variant of DCA, which can have more volatility.With pure DCA in an asset that appreciates over the long term what we do is to dampen volatility and as we move away from the same intervals and equal amounts we risk having more volatility.

Topic: [Total privacy Bitcoin]: off grid Transactions LoRaWan/goTenna
### Original post:
Recently I have been reading news about Mnuchin willing to impose stricter regulations on Bitcoin:US Financial Crimes Watchdog Preparing Significant Crypto Rules, Warns Treasury Secretary MnuchinOr again, I read comments on the Wall Observer thread about what you need to run in case of a CoronaVirus Outbreak. Of course a Bitcoin full node. But how do you connect to the bitcoin network when you are off the grid because a global pandemic has destroyed the telecommunication infrastructure and/or the government controls every internet traffic? Or, in a more less dystopian scenario: how can you transact bitcoin in case of lack of cellular coverage? Well, there are a couple of solution for this: LoRaWan and goTenna. These are two similar solutions, but even if they share some common background they are profoundly different in implementation and philosopy approach. Let's have a look at those two solutions: Lora/LoRaWanIf we go to the official LoRaWwan website we obtain a lot of useful informations: (minor edits to ease readability) Researching a well written document, we understand mode: So LoRaWan is the software layer, while LoRa is underlying the hardware.A LoRaWan network is composed <rest of post truncated>

I didn't think to a GLOBAL issue affecting the internet, while writing the above statement, but rather to a regional, statewide blackout. In case of a global internet blackout, I think yes I do agree, it was something I read about years ago: many concurrent chains, some emergency protocol forks to make blocks move again due to very high difficulty due to lack (or segregation) of miners. Interesting, but out of scope here.

If that happens in Australia, Japan or the Uk you're just as f%^% Same for an evil gubbermint blockade, who are you going to send your bitcoins to and for what?Yeah, it's a nice solution, it's a good back-up in case something totally wrong happens but let's think how this works in realitySo, you have no cellular coverage, you have no internet and you decide to send some bitcoins to an <truncated> you're cut off from the world, you can't speak with people over the phone over the internet you can't order anything online, you don't even know the price of BTC. To whom and why would you send bitcoins during these times?In my opinion, those things are more useful when you forget to pay your ISP bill or some idiot has cut a tree and destroyed a few cables and poles.

Topic: There Is No War Against Bitcoin! Stop The Fud!
### Original post:
I see many users talking about how USA government and Trump declared a war against Bitcoin! No, they didn't. Listen their message again! They declared a war against the criminals who are using bitcoin for illegal activities. A huge difference! This will be a good thing in the longterm. So stop spreading this fud cuz of wrong interpretation. Many big players already know that dollar is dying. They know that dollar can't survive for a long time. As the dollar collapses in the near or middterm future, bitcoin will rise and rise enormously. They know that. They also know that the trigger for all of this could be the next major financial crisis where a lot of funds will go to gold and bitcoin. But because bitcoin is a low marketcap compared to gold, it will rise much more than gold. They know that and they will try to regulate it but they cannot stop it. They (USA Congress) already admited that bitcoin is unstoppable. No one can stop it. If you can't win them, join them. So eventually everyone will join bitcoin in the future.

### Reply 1:
I can agree that people in crypto are easily triggered and by default declare governments and banks to be an enemy, and that while they have no clue about why they dislike them other than following the herd that has no clue either.Governments for a long time ignored Bitcoin because they thought it would implode and lose all its value, but a decade later it's still here. I got the feeling that because of Libra they have started to take Bitcoin more serious.As far as stopping the fud goes, it's impossible to do with how there are entire armies of bots automatically sharing news. News outlets wont stop with fud articles either because they attract a lot of clicks and therefore an important income stream.

### Reply 2:
There's a big difference by reading only the title than to the whole article, people just don't know how to read maybe or really have no time to understand the article but have more time to create FUD in cryptomarket. We should keep telling people not to panic, and educate them as much as possible for us to see a better market.

Topic: Bitcoin is no Tulip
### Original post:
I think the time has come, where it is reasonable to suggest that Bitcoin was not the ""purely speculative bubble asset"" that many thought it was. There are many examples of ridiculous items which enter massive bubbles, pop, and then fall toward zero, never to recover. Tulip bulbs in the 17th century, or Beanie Babies in the 90's, are two popular examples. As Bitcoin prices rose wildly and then popped last summer, a non-imaginative person could understandably perceive it as nothing but Tulip Mania. A fair argument, if you didn't understand Bitcoin, I suppose. Bitcoin was a ""flash in the pan,"" a quick, scammy, interesting phenomenon that went away after the early adopters cashed out.But now, given a full picture of Bitcoin's history, its rise last summer, crash, and rise again this winter, I think comparing Bitcoins to Tulips is naive and unjustified. Bitcoin is not going anywhere, it seems - the core protocol has survived every attack and misfortune, and now the market value has also survived every attack and misfortune. The market knows these things are not worth zero, which is what many detractors have prescribed. There will be more bubbles, I am positive. How does a global market<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
I would assume every have-competent hacker on the planet has tried to steal coins or screw with the protocol in some way. There hasn't even been an ""outage"" of the system, let alone a serious problem. It's almost impossible to imagine that software could be so resilient, which is why I like the theory that Satoshi was actually an artificial intelligence network which created Bitcoin either as a gift to mankind or as a trick for future global domination.

### Reply 2:
Yes, I think it is fair to say we've bounced off the $2 bottom now and may be heading for the next bubble. Next time I hear someone trotting out the Ponzi scheme line, I'll reply, ""Ponzi schemes don't bounce.""

Topic: Is future really bitcoin?>

Hi,Im new to trading, there are so many coins and I keep reading about bitcoin being unsustainable regarding energy it uses to mine and there are coins coming out with faster transactions time.If this is the case, Why is bitcoin considered the main one and its price not crashing from the threat of these other more equipped coins? Is bitcoin still able to develop and evolve and become energy sustainable and compete with faster transaction times if it is decentralized? No one is able to improve it?

### Reply 1:
Even though bitcoin is decentralized, are people still able to develop it and evolve it to compete with other crypto as time goes by?

### Reply 2:
One of the reasons that Bitcoin as a the first cryptocurrency becomes number one is its huge community. Because of this, i think, on the contrary, the other cryptocurrencies should compete the existence of bitcoin.

Forgive me if someone already posted about this, but I just found out about this. It looks like you follow their portal into amazon.com, give them your bitcoin address, and they send you a small percentage of the purchase price back to you in btc. Looks pretty cool, I'm going to try it next time I buy something on amazon. If anyone else tries it, let us know how it works out.

Topic: Idea: Diablo III Bitcoin Auction House
### Original post:
So Diablo III is up and running......and I found my first half decent item I don't have immediate use for. I just checked the gold auction house there are 2 items which come close.So I was about to make an auction for with a starting price similar to those.And guess what they charge a fee of 15%. Now that's a convenient way for them to decrease the inflation of ingame gold.Then I realized it is not that my item is so awesome it is that the auction house isn't really popular amoung the players.I just checked Ogrr too. Not really convenient there are no interesting offers either there (at least on the Europe realm)And before I do that I can just trade on <truncated> for other items or ingame gold.Using bitcoins just because isn't really an argument to use it. One thing that the ingame auction house is missing is any information on the popularity of the item, how many people already did bid there and it is impossible to tell if the item was bid at at all or if it is still at starting price.I'm not saying that this will be the killer app for bitcoin but it is one of those things I would really want to use it on, in a consistent way. Very soon Blizzard will enable some api (guess what i<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
I think this is one of the greatest ideas for BitCoin ever (besides my one ), but you should really change the title to say ""Diablo III Bitcoin Auction House"" or something, so people know to click on it I think you'll find MANY of the item farmers would jump on the chance to save 15% of their profits, all the while bypassing the <truncated> fees and hassles. Someone's gonna make a killing on this.

### Reply 2:
Granted it may take a while to gain traction and take off, but given proper support, ease of use, and fluidity, I believe people will be drawn to it, especially if you have advanced item search features and a strong community. You can also just spend your BTC on items you DO need, or spend them elsewhere on other real life goods. Converting to fiat will also be much cheaper than the fees bliz tacks on.EDIT: I bet you 21 million BitCoins the D3 eula has a clause against using 3rd party auction houses

Topic: BTC unconfirmed transactions exceed 500k on mempool
### Original post:
Hi everyoneright now we have 520k unconfirmed transactions on mempool with 1.9 GB capacitydo you think this may affect BTC usability especially for small transactions right nowyou need to pay 15% fees for 100$ transaction if the devs didnt ban those BRC tokenswe may even see fees exceed 100$ and we may reach millions of unconfirmed transactions in the future and only whales and miners will benifit

### Reply 1:
The current network is congested because of BRC-20 tokens. This is the reason why Bitcoin is walking away from its real goal. I tried a few days ago to make a Bitcoin payment where transaction fees became $17 to make a $50 transaction. So how will we make Bitcoin payments and use it as a payment method? Most likely now, stable coins would be popular payment methods instead of Bitcoin due to the high fees. We always blame Ethereum for high transaction fees, but lately Bitcoin transaction fees surpass Ethereum transaction fees. I hope developers will find a solution for that. Still, LN isn't very popular worldwide.

### Reply 2:
I think this post is a perfect fit for the ""Mempool Observer Topic"". We have talked about congested transactions and high Bitcoin fees a lot lately, so no need for another thread and to rehash everything all over again.

Topic: If BTC Dominance will drop to 40%, what will happen?
### Original post:
I noticed that if BTC has a big dominant rate the entire crypto is bad, in short it looks bullish. Though the rate now is very consistent to 50% and above, what do you think will happen to the market if it will drop that low. Will this gives a bad or good effect to BTC and Altcoins?

### Reply 1:
The marketcap is the only basis when I tried to analyze things, I'm really as good as other traders who very smart with their TA.I noticed that during the bull run, the marketcap showed BTC dominance of only 40% or over and the market really looks good at that point. So, in case it will drop again, it should mean a good price for every coins.Note : during the last bull run, even shitcoins made a rally also, so it could happen again IMO.

### Reply 2:
When there is drop in the dominance of bitcoin, in one way or other some other altcoins is getting its increase in the dominance level. This is a form of loss in strength, automatically there'll be some impact on the price if such scenario exist. When ethereum dominance increased nearing to bitcoin the growth was tremendous with ethereum.

Topic: I went to Meze Grill today and paid with VISA
### Original post:
...and the ""Bitcoin Accepted Here"" sticker isn't there anymore. How sad, I came all that way to eat and pay with Bitcoin!It seemed they might have accepted if I pushed them to accept it, part of why they seemed hesitant was that it seemed difficult and cumbersome to them. They still had a full piece of laminated paper with a QR code of their Bitcoin address... but my take on it was the owner wasn't there, and the guy working there was reluctant to deal with processing a Bitcoin transaction and seemed to know nothing more about Bitcoin than the QR code.Would have been nice if they had Bit-Pay, and have a bitcoin transaction pop up on all their mobile phones at the same time, denominated in dollars, so someone with no clue or interest in BTC could still accept them no matter who was working.An electronic transaction wouldn't have worked for me anyway since the only BTC I had ready access to were Casascius Coins. I was carrying two 5BTC bitnickels, four 1BTC coins, and a 25BTC coin. The guy there seemed like he had never seen them before, I was very sad he wasn't eager to feed me for them. The food was damn good though, worth going back for even if not for BTC.I left a couple Casasciu<rest of post truncated>

Topic: What metrics do we want to extract from the Bitcoin transaction graph?
### Original post:
For the purpose of researching the Quantitative Analysis of the Full Bitcoin Transaction Graph paper, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron have parsed the blockchain data, put it in a query-friendly database and built some tools to analyze it.The particular metrics they have so far chosen to extract from this data, and their interpretation of them, have been the subject of some criticism. However, now that they have this infrastructure for analysis, they would like to leverage it to analyze more useful metrics.They are asking the Bitcoin community - what information do you want to try to extract from the transaction graph?

Topic: [ASK] About Ledger and Transaction Speed ​Bitcoin
### Original post:
We know that all bitcoin transactions will be recorded in the ledger and the data will get bigger day by day, is it logical if the recording has reached 100 or 200 years, and how big will the bitcoin ledger data be in the future?In my opinion, bitcoin transactions are very slow, because they take around 10 minutes, even though currently there is LN but in my opinion it is not the right solution, especially since there are people who say LN is not bitcoin because it is different from the main bitcoin network. Can bitcoin transactions be accelerated in the future? I think Bitcoin needs to accelerate with increasingly sophisticated technological developments, and transaction speed will probably become a vital need in the future

### Reply 1:
This has actually been a concern to me even thogugh I do not see it from a technical standpoint as I am no developer but looking intrinsically, it will not be ideal to have Bitcoin continue with this degree of drag and possibly increase it over the years without an upgrade.The Bitcoin developers should work on an upgrade just like ethereum is working on upgrades to find possible means of processing transactions faster than initial design time.

### Reply 2:
Many will understand your concern of having that 10 minutes confirmation time, but that is just an average before a new block is found and developers won't just update because of this and for a reason of it's actually technically possible (i hope im wrong). But instead they could at least extend higher storage size instead of 2 1 mb for every block for more transaction getting catered in every block.

### Reply 2:
Nowadays Bitcoin mining activities have become more efficient and greener compared to several years ago. Many Bitcoin miners have started using renewable energy to support their Bitcoin mining activities, and this provides a good opportunity to reduce the carbon footprint of Bitcoin mining globally. The facts show that energy usage in Bitcoin mining is even lower than banking (<link> <truncated> so attacking Bitcoin because of its energy use and environmental sustainability issues is just propaganda made up to distort people's views on Bitcoin.

Topic: BTC halving event - What can we expect?
### Original post:
As the BTC ETFs are now approved, the market is looking onto the next bullish catalyst for the crypto market known as the BTC halving event. The BTC halving event takes place every four years and cuts the rewards for Bitcoin mining in half. It has occurred three times so far in 2012, 2016 and 2020. The next halving event is on April 22nd, a month prior to possible ETH ETF approvals.Looking at past data reveals mixed patterns in BTC halving occurrences leading up to the event. Some data suggests market corrections preceding the halving, while other data points to market surges. However, a consistent trend emerges for all post-halving periods, showing that each of the three halving events initiated a bullish cycle in the crypto market on HTF. This indicates that any market correction around the BTC halving event is a generational investment opportunity from a a long-term perspective.The first BTC halving was followed by a 10300% rise of BTC over a period of 12 months.The second halving event was followed by a 3000% rise of BTC over a period of 18 months.The third halving event was followed by a 750% rise of BTC over a period of 18 months.After each halving event, the percentage move <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
I made a post earlier regarding Bitcoin Halving Events. It's going to happen in April of this year and the biggest expectation you can have is supply shock.Which will eventually make the price go up due to demand/supply ratio. It will take some months after the Halving event for the ratio to get equal atleast.

Topic: Coin generation participation survey
### Original post:
It is common to hear people explain to newcomers to bitcoin that ""its not about the coin generation or getting free money, its about creating a medium of exchange"". I am interested in what the current ratio of generators to non-generators in the community is. Obviously this is an extremely NON-scientific method of examining that. So:1) Have you been using bitcoin for more than two months?2) Are you currently attempting to generate coins?3) If not currently generating, have you attempted in the past? If generating, how long have you been generating?4) Have you ever succeeded in generating a block? Many blocks?5) Why or why not do you generate? Purely profit-oriented comparison of cost of generation with market value in another currency? Just for fun? As a selfless contribution to the mathematical strength of the proof of work?Feel free to answer as much or as little as you like and I'm also interested in anything else relevant you would care to add. I will reply to my own post as the first answer.

2020 was supposed to be an amazing year for me after buying some BTC and altcoins back in 2019 but the Corona virus came and had to dispose by crypto bag for survival before the bullrun came. It's a year I would never forget coz my life would have changed drastically if Covid 19 hadn't messed things up.Fast forward to 2023, I have been able to accumulate some few BTC from my monthly pay check and the news of Bitcoin spot ETF approval arosed my hope again that BTC might kickstart the mini bullrun before the halving but the reverse was the case as BTC fails to hit the $50k mark.While reading some crypto news earlier today, I came across a survey conducted by Bitget towards the end of last year in several region of the world where crypto investors share their anticipation and investment plan in crypto ahead of 2024 pre and post BTC halving and seeing 84% of the people saying BTC will cross the previous $69k ATH while also confirming they are increasing their investment ahead of the pre-halving makes me feel 2024 might be another good year for me.Although some expert suggested that people should be careful as BTC might trade around $30k - $60k within this period which makes it even a m<rest of post truncated>

I don't care about the prices reflected by the analysts in the first place. Secondly if it is about investing then every dip is a buying opportunity. By accepting the Bitcoin ETF, this should be a sign that Bitcoin is still able to grow, especially in the price of Bitcoin. This has become a reflection of Bitcoin's long-term fundamentals, plus the deterioration of the dollar or fiat currency in each country as well as public perception of inflation in each country.If you intend to invest then make sure you buy and buy when the Bitcoin price drops and save. Sell when you feel like you have enough. If you worry and focus too much on someone's analysis, I'm sure you won't be optimal in investing or will even suffer losses due to being swayed by rumors and slanted news.

### Reply 2:
the survey is just a survey. it could happen or will not but our expectations as BTC holders will always go up pre and post-halving. no need to ask this but the only time BTC holder expects a dump is when the price already hits the ATH in the bull market.zooming out to the chart in the monthly time frame, i think we have a long bull market before we could reach the ATH. the bull market could end in mid-2025 or early 2026.

Topic: Add ""How to help [bitcoin]"" on front page/FAQ
### Original post:
I think many people are wondering what they should do to most effectively support bitcoin and secure its successful future. It would help to have this explained somewhere visibly. I believe the best thing everybody can do is to offer services and goods for bitcoins, that's what makes a currency useful, an ability to exchange it for as much diverse spectrum of what one might want as possible. It's also an investment as with every new thing that can be bought for bitcoins the value of bitcoins themselves rises.This can take many forms, it could be game (items for BTCs), support forum (BTCs as reward), micro-donations ... anything, but I think it's best to start with the virtual stuff ... or not creativity is key ...

### Reply 1:
Ah, I saw that already and forgot But it's still buried in the wiki (which is not linked from the main page) and does not contain the most important point IMO, that is *use bitcoins* to provide a service (good). If there is nothing to buy for bitcoins there is no incentive to use them.Thanks

### Reply 2:
I added ""How to help Bitcoin"" to the FAQ.I don't think it matters very much if the sidebar link says ""Documentation"" or ""Wiki"". Or does it?

Topic: I Want To Invest Money From My Inheritance In Bitcoin, But?
### Original post:
After my father died 3 weeks ago, we as 5 brothers agreed to fulfill my father's wishes by selling part of his land to be sold and distributed to 5 members. So my parents' house still has 250 meters of land next to my parents' house which is currently still occupied by my mother and two younger siblings and the land area of the house is also quite large.Long story short, from the sale of 250 meters of land, 5 family members each received $4,400. And I have plans to buy Bitcoin to increase my Bitcoin amount in the near future so that the money is not reduced for unimportant purposes. Because it cannot be denied that if I see large amounts of cash, I will definitely want to buy what I want, not what I need.And what confused me was that 2 of my family members, namely 1 older brother and 1 younger brother, wanted to share some of their money to invest in my Bitcoin. And they themselves don't want to do it for reasons, they don't want to bother.Even if he wants, I will teach him to make a Bitcoin wallet. But they still don't want to and want to combine their money with my money to invest in Bitcoin, and they already know that I have been involved with Bitcoin for a long time and they al<rest of post truncated>

I do hope you are aware of the risks involved when investing in crypto or any other digital assets and thus why they always emphasize that you should invest what you can afford to lose so that should anything go wrong, you won't end up in a rock bottom and depressing situation.It would be preferable that your other interested family members also decided to invest on their own and not make you the custodian of their money. Money breeds enmity even among family members as you grow. If things don't work out, you will be in a tight spot. It's better you just guide them through, and they also do the fishing for themselves.

### Reply 2:
I think the reason why they don't want to have or make own a Bitcoin is because they have zero knowledge of how to protect the wallet that is why they decided to put their money into you because they know you have knowledge of how to protect them. It is just likely the same happened to me with my friend since he doesn't know much about Bitcoin and the risk of the internet he wants to buy Bitcoin and wants to send it to me and hold it for him because I know how to protect his Bitcoin.Meaning your two brother trust you about their investment in Bitcoin.What I would like to suggest make an offline wallet with two different and seed backups using the Electrum wallet make sure that you write them on the piece of paper put their Bitcoin in each of these wallets and then try to give the piece of paper to your two brothers and tell them that this is their wallet backup.If they don't want then keep them in a safe place where no one knows where you hide them. Also don't forget to take one of the BTC addresses (Public key) from each wallet where you deposited BTC and then don't forget to erase the wallet from the offline device where you created these two wallets or format the hard drive for <rest of post truncated>

A lot of people claim themselves as Satoshi to get the attention of many people and to get the benefits that they wanted but little did they know that they are just making their life miserable, why? because people will find a way to prove that they are the fake one and besides they can't even show a single proof that they are Satoshi. Also, if he is Satoshi why would he choose to hide himself for a long time and decided to show up? what is the specific reason? does he really think that people will believe in him just because he has knowledge about bitcoin? don't let yourself be deceive by him and by his words because he isn't Satoshi.

I was browsing OpenCores.org and saw that they have an open-source GPL SHA crypto cores:You can download it here. I'm thinking that it would be cool if someone put this on an FPGA (or even fabricated it) and have it set to constantly generate SHA hashes to find bitcoins . Probably wouldn't be as fast as a TESLA running CUDA bitcoin generation, but the idea of having a dedicated bitcoin generator piece of hardware sounded cool to me .Anyone have an FPGA and want to try this out?(update: here's another free crypto core - Nugroho Free Hash Cores (NFHC) currently support SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512 from FIPS-180 standard.)

I'm wondering how many Hashes/Sec you could get out of a T3 Server . (on another related note, it is too bad that since Oracle bought Sun, now all their stuff is closed-source...the Sparc T1 and T2 were open-sourced GPL...)

Same here but I think this is just a game to play with the cryptocurrency community and market either from the SEC, or hacker because Gary Gensler just on Twitter that ""The SECGov Twitter account was compromised, and an unauthorized tweet was posted. The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products.""

Topic: Updates from the COPA v Craig Wright trial
### Original post:
Day 1I've been watching the entirety of the Crypto Open Patient Alliance -v- Dr Craig Steven Wright trial down in London which started today and plan to watch as much of it as I possibly can. Decided to start a thread for daily updates and discussion. Not much has happened so far and just seems to be the opening statements. COPA briefly went through a handful of the forged documents including the LaTeX whitepaper and Craig's defence seemed to consist of just letting the court know about Craig's autism and previous suicide attempt due to the stress of trying and failing to prove he's Satoshi. I guess they know they're probably not going to win this so are going for the sympathy route or at least bracing themselves for inevitable failure and using Craig's autism as an excuse for the lies and forged <truncated> those not in the know: <link> just watch the Dr Bitcoin podcast on COPA vs. Craig Wright: <link> anyone has any questions feel free to ask.Updates:Day 2: <link> 3: <link> 4: <link> 5: <link> 6: <link> 7: <link> 8-11: <link> 12: <link> 13: <link> 14: <link> 15: <link> 16: <link> 17-18: <link> 19: <link> Bitcoin Podcast updates:Part 1: <link> 2: <link> 3: <link> 4: <link> 5: <lin<rest of post truncated>

That's what CSW and his lawyer could do at this moment because they know that they do not have any proof. I haven't watched anything and don't know where to check how CSW was lookin like. Bu his lawyer seems like helpless when he was using craig's autism and his suicidal attempts as an excuse. LOL. Who know's what this person want? What would be his benefit if people accept his as satoshi as he do not have the access to anything (like old bitcoin on old addresses). Maybe he would be sucessfully able to scam people by start selling shitcoins?

He wants copyright rights. I.e. money, and to control bitcoin development and its infrastructure. This is written in the text quoted by OP.

Topic: Is an hypothetical ""chance"" attack possible?
### Original post:
People discussed that there is an element of ""chance"" or ""luck"" involved in generating a block.So, one day I might generate two blocks while another day I might generate none.Now the network is build around people generating blocks which seals in the transactions etc.And since a double spending attack is possible by 'reversing' the block -- which requires significant CPU time --,is the 'double spending attack' based a bit on chance, or not?If so, then an attacker wouldn't just need half the network, or more.The attacker needs just 40 percent of the network? more or less, right?It all depends on chance if reversing the block has a chance element to it.So I ask my fellow Bitcoiners: Does it?PS: Sorry for being away, I'll be on the forum from now on again!

Topic: A few questions
### Original post:
Is it possible to know when I will get newly minted bitcoins from my processing? I've been generating for a few weeks now and haven't seen any. Does everyone get new bitcoins at once? I have read about backing up your wallet.dat file but not much about restoring from backups - do you simply install Bitcoin and then write over the wallet.dat with your archived version of wallet.dat? If you archive your wallet.dat and then a make a transaction, and say your hard drive crashes and you restore your old wallet.dat from before the last transaction - does this restore everything you had before that transaction? And the last transaction after backing up is then lost forever?Say I reinstall my OS and then reinstall Bitcoin and recover with my old wallet.dat - do I keep my progress I had made minting my next bitcoins, or do I have to start over from the beginning?Is it conceivable to have a Bitcoin smartphone app, so you could make in-person trades and verify that they have paid you?

### Reply 1:
you can not be in the start or in the middle of generating bitcoins. I think you should read FAQ more carefully

### Reply 2:
This is being worked on, but everything is at an early stage.

Topic: Application to manage users, wallet, and to audit
### Original post:
Right now it is very easy for single users to use bitcoin. It is easy to deploy on a single computer and accept and send payments. For a medium or large business, however, it might be a little risky to allow a single person to control the bitcoin application.That is why I am proposing maybe we could develop an application around bitcoin that supports multiple users to manage a wallet so there is an ability to audit user transactions. The wallet must be secure from the users except maybe from a 'superuser'. The application also needs to have the ability to automatically backup the wallet without exposing the wallet.One of my other concerns is that it is very hard to accept automated payments from a website. Every thing has to be manual, for instance, I need to manually generate a payment key if I want someone to pay me. This is great for bartering but we need to take it to the next level and make it automatic and make sending and receiving payments instant.Scalability is another issue. As a website grows the application needs to scale with the number of users.Anyone up for this? I might be...

### Reply 1:
I agree that better bitcoin support for merchants is necessary. I like this idea. Merchants will want to see it integrated with accounting somehow. At a minimum small businesses have receipts and can go through them at the end of the day, but since this is all online a much more efficient integration is possible. We need it for merchants to adopt this. It ought be <truncated> than the other systems to really get good traction.

### Reply 2:
Bitcoin has the ability to support non-standard transactions; this has so far been disabled in the official client.You could for example design a non-standard transaction that must be signed by two people before it makes it into a block.Then all you have to do is give two trustworthy people in your business a private key each and make sure they keep that key safe.Using the block chain directly is a much safer option IMO than building another layer of security software on top of Bitcoin. The more complexity, the more potential security holes.

Topic: Just bought FBTC in my 401k. First time ever holding crypto for retirement.
### Original post:
I have a feeling that the wide availability of Bitcoin ETFs will herald one of the longest and most stable bull markets for Bitcoin that we have seen to date. I've always invested in BTC using a private wallet but with Fidelity's offering I feel fairly safe and confident putting a portion of my 401k into it. I had to check a few boxes that I accept the risk but other than that Fidelity authorized the transaction.

### Reply 1:
Just by being a consistent member of this forum, you can learn how bitcoin works And also understand the risk involved so that you can directly invest in Bitcoin and understand what you are getting into so that your investment in Bitcoin will be one that has a good testimony at the end. By only owning ETF's, you are not going to really enjoy the full benefits of bitcoins like the privacy and self custody, you still will have to pay maintenance fees which somehow is not different from the regular bank charges always complained about.

### Reply 2:
Investing in ETFs compared to Bitcoin actually has disadvantages such as freedom and Bitcoin we cannot control completely. And investing in an ETF means we don't own the underlying asset directly, in this case bitcoin. This means you lose certain benefits, such as the ability to spend our bitcoins directly and some other points. As is usually done with our own Bitcoin holdings with complete freedom. Additionally, ETFs typically require higher fees due to brokerage fees, and this is obviously a bit different compared to actual Bitcoin.And there are definitely advantages and disadvantages, and it is best to carry out thorough and detailed analysis and research before making a decision and also as a consideration.
