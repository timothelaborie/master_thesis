Topic: donatify.org - rewarding quality content with bitcoin-microtransactions
### Original post:
we are working on a new idea which will reward quality content on the web called donatify. this will be done by <truncated> and exclusively with BTCBTCBTC! our main point is that you wont have to deal with donation buttons anymore and all that pain. donatify will allocate your monthly donation amount - you once have to set up - according to your content usage. meaning your time your are spending on blogs etc. and we are dealing with the rest. not only you are give props to good content providers but you are working with us to spread the acceptance of bitcoins. because we will send content providers, who are not signed up yet with us, an invitation to accept a bitcoin wallet with their donation amount allocated to them the previous month by donatify users!so guys check out our idea on www.donatify.org and drop us some comments here what you are thinking about!!! thx. rob

It's a good concept, I might be willing, but if you are planning on doing it as an anonymous entity then forget it. I'm out.

### Original post:
Don't know if it's more FUD or??The People's Bank of China (PBOC) ordered banks and third-party payment companies to close Bitcoin trading accounts before April 15, Caixin.com Thursday reported citing unnamed sources from the central bank.Full Article via ECNS.CN:<link>

i think that this is going to hurt bitcoin for a minute but once china figures out what the hell they want to do price is going to be back over 1,000 and will countinue to grow

### Reply 2:
China has a vested interest in seeing the world's reserve currency maintain what little value it still has. A threat to the USD is a threat to them. Bitcoin is probably the single biggest threat to the USD and therefore a threat to China. No one gives up power without a fight.

### Reply 1:
To be fair, the ""bitcoin maximalist"" title, mostly being used as a derogatory term by some of the hardcore Ethereum people, is being used on people really really broadly. Heck, I was called a ""BiTcOiN mAxiMaLiSt"" by a decently followed Ethereum shill just because I stated somewhere that I only held bitcoin, even though I openly stated that I'm really open to other altcoin experiments.

### Reply 2:
After more than a year of being called that, I honestly still don't know if I should take it as a compliment or an insult. Mostly just me scratching my head in confusion.

Topic: BTCChina Clarification on Decision to Shut Down Exchanges
### Original post:
We've received several questions from customers following our announcement yesterday. We'd like to make the following clarifications: 1. BTCChina will completely shut down its exchange businesses on September 30th. 2. We made the decision to close our exchanges after considering this announcement published by Chinese regulators: <link> BTCC is a separate company from BTCChina. BTCC Pool, BTCC USD Exchange, BTCC DAX, BTCC Mobi, and BTCC Mint are not affected by this change. Please check out our BTCC products by visiting <link> and <link> BTCChina Exchange and BTCChina Blockchain+ have enough funds to accommodate all customer withdrawals, including CNY, BTC, LTC, BCC, and ETH.5. BTCChina encourages customers to withdraw their funds as quickly as possible. Customers can withdraw their funds whenever they want.6. BTCChina processes all withdrawals (including CNY, BTC, LTC, and ETH) within 24 hours.7. BTCChina customers will still be able to withdraw their funds after September 30. We will let customers know if there are any changes.8. BTCChina's Blockchain+ platform will open up BCC withdrawals before Sunday, September 24th.

### Reply 1:
Why would someone be so stupid to wait after 30 September and then withdraw his funds?It`s obvious that most of the users will withdraw their funds before 30 September.It`s sad that some bureaucrats will destroy all the chinese cryptocurrency exchanges and perhaps all the mining in China.Bitcoin and all the other altcoins will need a few months to recover from this ""disaster"".

### Reply 2:
I agree with you . We need to get the most accurate information from the Chinese community, if this really happens then surely the cryptocurrency market will have a lot of big losses and it will be very difficult to recover in the future.

Topic: Ross Ulbricht: FBI Didn't Have Search Warrant, Violated Fourth Amendment
### Original post:
A new statement released by the defense team of Ross Ulbricht, the alleged owner of Silk Road, a DarkNet drug marketplace, accuses the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) of violating the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. They claim that the Bureau did not have a legal search warrant when they found the Silk Road servers, which were located in Iceland. Ulbrichts defense has requested that the court drop all charges, since the federal government of the United States broke their own laws when seeking out the location of the Silk Road Servers.More info at <link>

### Reply 1:
IMO this case is too high profile for a judge to grant a dismissal. They are throwing the book at him to make an example so that others won't think about following in his footsteps

### Reply 2:
People started following in his footsteps within days.Still I love the low quality reporting by coinfinanceWell no that is not the case. Evidence from an illegal search can be excluded on the grounds that it violated the defendants rights. It is also possible that any subsequence evidence obtained could also be excluded ""fruit of the poisonous tree"". That is what the lawyer is seeking.Even if a judge agrees and excludes some or all of the evidence, it is possible to sustain the indictment using evidence which isn't excluded. On the other hand it is is possible that with the evidence excluded the government will not be able to meet the minimum burden required. The defense would then move to have the charges dropped with prejudice (jeopardy has already attached) on the grounds that the prosecution has not met its prima facie case. This could be done immediately and it could also be done when the prosecution rests its case. It would be a huge victory for DPR but there is no magic ""bad search = drop charges"" law in the US.

Nerds gotta have their fun, whereever or whatever they may be. I often wonder who Theymos really is.

### Reply 2:
You are posting this on a Bitcoin forum and are not being censored. Bitcointalk is generally uncensored.What you mean is that the subreddit r/bitcoin is censored. You are correct, but you're missing the point. They're not anything like the North Korean media, because the North Korean media is in the public sector and cannot be legally shown from the private sector. Therefore, in North Korea they are capable of censoring all other communication channels, whereas r/bitcoin cannot do this.

Topic: Main reason  government won't fully accept bitcoin
### Original post:
The kind of people we have in government are people who always want to fight for their selfish interests, anything that will surely benefit them. If it's something good that has to with better development for humanity as far as it won't benefit them they will surely go against it.The reason government won't accept bitcoin is not because it is a decentralized currency, it is because they won't be able to print it like they print fiat to steal as much as they can .If bitcoin is something the government can manipulate to steal public fund they would accept it even before now without any delay.

### Reply 1:
In developed countries where humanity is respected and citizens have rights to fight for their freedom, governments are not free to do everything they want. They have to step back and accept some requests from citizens.Oppositely in developed countries or ones from third world or from countries with dictatorship like Russia, North Korea, Cuba etc. people have zero freedom or little freedom. They don't have basic human rights and governments have more power.If Bitcoin won't die, governments can not banned it or killed it entirely. If they can not banned the Internet and can not restrict ASIC manufacturers and Bitcoin mining farms, they can not kill Bitcoin.They can not steal your bitcoin if you store your bitcoins in non custodial wallets.In contrast, they can steal your bitcoin if you store it on centralized exchanges that can be fully controlled by governments.

### Reply 2:
Most of the reasons as to why the govt would be adamant on fully accepting Bitcoin has been enumerated here but I'd like to point out another reason; encouraging and accepting Bitcoin will directly mean they are relinquishing control and without control over your finance, it becomes difficult for banks to dictate how you spend your finance.Till date, there has been the issue of banks and govt fighting against the digital coin, with it's penchant for high volatility, it is regarded by them as unstable and untrustworthy; these are true facts but their main reason of objection is so control is not taken from them. Too bad for them that the scales have fallen from people's eyes.

The most risky operations with finance were when i exchanging fiat money for cryptocurrencies through the exchanger, where you first need to send money to the exchanger and wait for the transfer of bitcoins

I don't get what zelle transfer is.I haven't tried making transaction on localbitcoin, don't have any accounts either but seeing there were crimes with it where one party robbed the other instead of exchanging. This is really a scary situation which is why this is something really not worth doing unless you do meet in the public place.

uhmm, well i think that all survey sites are basically the same as faucet sites, but they pay you not in bitcoin.So making surveys will yield you probably profit that is similiar with profit gotten from faucet sites... not worth it at all actually.

Topic: A friendly warning: the SEC is all over these boards. Don't break any laws.
### Original post:
I ran across this article back from November: <link> Hory sheet. 700,000 bitcoins at its peak? I can assure you if you run some kind of ponzi or scheme that violates US laws (and as you can see, a judge ruled that cryptocurrency ponzis are still illegal) then you have probably already caught the SEC's attention. If you make a lot of money off of one of these schemes, they will almost certainly come after you. With the EU ruling that Bitcoin is a currency, this is likely to only get more severe with time. Cryptocurrency, like the Internet in the 90's, is a new Wild West frontier. As such there are a lot of ways to make a lot of legitimate riches. There are also a lot of ways to violate traditional laws and get skullfucked by men in suits. Someone warned me they are aggressively looking for anyone here who claims their cryptocurrency represents a business, as this also is illegal (thanks fam). It elevates your crypto to the status of a traditional security, and you aren't authorized to do that. Finally, though I'm not aware of anyone being brought up on charges yet for it, you can bet your ass that the first convictions for ""internet securities fraud"" are only a matter of time with r<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Thanks for the heads up. SEC and other people in suit and tie should really be watching these boards seeing that there are a lot of illegal stuff going on. However, I am not afraid of it; I consider myself legitimate and earning in legit ways. It's just that there are no regulations here or whatsoever that I should worry about. Bad for people who made millions and chose to defect from the good side that made the gov't follow them (Garza, Karpeles etc.).

### Reply 2:
Yes thanks for the reminder.As a rule one should never post anything you are not willing to be repeated and or used in public. Which is kind of stating the obvious but many don't see their posts as being 'in the public' but just being on a forum.The internet is PUBLIC and everything you say can and will be used against you when you least expect it....

Hello, I am having a heck of a time finding a bank friendly to my bitcoin registered money services business. Can anyone point me in the direction of some banks that they have had success with?I have tried about 20 banks with no success. The only ones that are known to be friendly (I.e Silvergate) have minimum accounts volume/transactions that are far from within my business operations. Thanks for the time.

Topic: Can you give one reason why I should buy bitcoin?
### Original post:
A friend of mine once told me that I can become very by investing in bitcoin and <truncated> to him,he said some crypto analyst and experts have long predicted that bitcoin has the largest transfer of wealth and affluent The world has ever seen and that most of them that are investing in it will be the ones to be rewarded.I'm certainly not convinced about this information that he gave to me...I want better ideas and enlightenment on why I should buy bitcoin.I need help please!

### Reply 1:
The question you need to ask yourself is why do you want to buy bitcoin. For most people the sole purpose of buying and holding bitcoin is to save them selfs from traditional financial restrictions. Bitcoin has many benefits but the most important part ones is it been a store of value because it has limited supply and also hedges against inflation. For someone who is looking to save money without the fear of losing due to devaluation of the traditional financial system then bitcoin also solves that. Also bitcoin is a currency that can be use for payment purposes and this has been proved to be more efficient than traditional currencies or any other digital currencies most especially cross border transactions. Bitcoin also generates you profit while holding it because of its volatility which also in turns could cause loses but this can be minimized if youre looking to hold for a very long period of time. So the best thing is for you to do your own research and compare the risk and benefit of bitcoin and then relate maybe someone like you could actually get involved.

### Reply 2:
I would say you should invest in bitcoin because you beleive in it and not because someone told you to. For the sake of emphasises, I would repeat, Bitcoin and not altcoin. In recent times, altcoins has proven to be more risky than you would have imagined with most of them dumping to never rise again and an inexperience person could easily find themselves in a deep shit.Maybe this is some means to go about your research but, I would say you should make conscious effort to understanding all that it entails before investing.

Morning, i am having issues with withdrawing money from my private key from blockchain to coinbase. i constantly receives this message: unsupported private key format. Please advise.Thanks

### Reply 1:
What do you mean ""from blockchain to coinbase""? From where you got that error message?Hey Bro, do never use your private keys. Even i can't understand your issue but it seems you are doing some dangerous moves. Afaik, none would ask you for your private keys unless you are willing to migrate from a wallet to another but this option isn't available with coinbase wallet as far as i can remember.Whatever, do never reveal your private keys! And do never believe anyone contacting you in private pretending to help you, he is surely trying to steal your keys.You need to explain further your issue so we can help you.

### Reply 2:
You'll have to give more information than this, without revealing your private key.

Greetings,The Bitcoin Trading Group is now open for business. The BTG is a trading organization which allows individuals to follow a bitcoin traders transactions in the Mt. Gox market. The Bitcoin Trading Group has been managing a few accounts for a testing period and is now ready to open to the general public.The BTG is not a hedge-fund or investment service, but rather it is an opportunity for individuals to mimic a bitcoin traders trades for a performance fee (10%) based on a high watermark. The objective of the BTG is to maximize the bitcoin in a followers account and assess a performance fee based on the bitcoin generated. We value your privacy, so we do not require anything but API details through email.How it works:1.Open an account with Mt. Gox and fund it with bitcoin2.Create an API key to both get_info and trade and email this key to us3.We will trade your account and assess a performance fee based on profits generatedWhat we do:1.We will enter trades in a master account which will be mimicked in all participating accounts2.We will trade in the hopes of growing the bitcoin balance of individual participants3.We will invoice clients through the email which they provide req<rest of post truncated>

1. Past performance - 9.85% return this month in my personal account. In my other trading activities I made 2.5% in July and 2.6% in August. As a trader my first priority is to manage risk, so I only enter trades with the exit already located and sufficient liquidity in the market.2. The mimic part is run through a program created by a prominent developer in the bitcoin community. Basically the software gets an account balance of all the individuals who are participating in the program and lets me know how much bitcoin or USD I'm trading. When I enter a trade, it divides the quantity I am trading out to all the accounts which are participating based on a percentage ownership. Example - I have 3 customers. Two customers have 10 bitcoin, and one has 100 bitcoin for a total of 120 bitcoin under management. I enter a trade to sell 60 bitcoin. The first two customers with 10 bitcoin each have an 8.33% stake while the large customer has an 83.33% stake. My order is divided proportionately so the two customers each sell 5 bitcoin while the larger customer sells 50 bitcoin. The percent gain or loss I make on this trade will be mimicked across every account.3. The control you give me is tha<rest of post truncated>

Topic: would this be a good idea for doing safe bitcoin loans?
### Original post:
To get a loan on bitcointalk.org you must have some type of collateral. Someone should design a coin and premine it all the way out so that they own 100% of the coin. They should then create a website where people can go buy the coin with moneypak, perfect money, etc. Each coin should be valued at 5 dollars since loans tend to be big anyways. When you need a btc loan but don't have time to wait on coinbase or whatever your method is of getting coins you simply go get a moneypak (or whatever forum of money accepted) and go to the collateral website and purchase coins equiv. to the needed btc amount. You then come on bitcointalk.org and make a post for how much btc you need loaned and offer your collateral coins as collateral. If the users fails to repay the btc you just go to collateralcoins.com (just a name. not really the website) and redeem your coins for paypal, moneypak, etc. It would be up to the lender how many collateral coins the person wanting the loan will need to pay you. I suggest doing 125% just in case btc jumps up overnight like it has been doing lately and someone just runs off with your lended btc. With this method their would be one universal form of collateral an<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
The people buying the collateral coin would be the people that need to get a loan but don't have time to wait on coinbase, mtgox, etc.

### Reply 2:
Noo thats not what I mean... Lets say they wanted a 100 dollar loan for btc then they would buy 20 collateral coins (more if the lender request more for safety). And ideally this would just be for people needing quick btc. Not people that don't have money.. But like I said its just an idea. I don't plan on implementing it but it would be cool to see a trusted member do it.

Topic: Why trust anyone without a contract?
### Original post:
Good faith in services won't be enough, we have learned. I would strongly advise any new eWallet or Dwolla-like services offer a contract that when signed, legally obligates you to carry out your end of the services. This includes compensation for any losses.To the client-end, if they refuse to enter into a contract, DO NOT USE their services.If it may be difficult on how to structure such a contract - treat it as if it were a Bitcoin Constitution. Let the community build the template of this <truncated> 'All services must abide by these agreements herein'.

### Reply 1:
How do you grab bitcoins from inside a secure server?Seems like the insurance rates would have to have been sky high to cover the losses that people's friendly neighborhood hackers are showing them - or maybe not quite exactly showing them in detail - how to ""explain away"".I wonder how much losses paypal, e-gold, pecunix, alertpay and so on take regularly from these same or equivalent hackers?Hey maybe they even use sock-puppet accounts to get auctionable stuff from merchants and charge back the merchants so as to cover all the losses these hackers cause them? Maybe that'd be better than admitting these hacks are so easy, that no system, even made by security expert <truncated> is unhackable, that, rather, one simply has to plan to in effect ""pay off"" a certain percentage of customer funds to hackers?-MarkM- (Oh wait, did I forget a <sarc>...</sarc> somewhere in there?)

### Reply 2:
I am not sure how much experience you have with the real world already... But in the vast majority of cases a contract is only there to benefit the richest party of a transaction (whoever can afford the lawyer) and its sole purpose is to LIMIT liabilities such as ""having to pay for any losses"" No company would ever sign random different contracts with / and made by each customer that would hold them liable for things beyond their control. That is insanity.

Topic: A Social Network For Crypto Land
### Original post:
So I had a site, <link> that was an old doge faucet. I decided to turn it into a social network for crypto people.It's really basic right now. I'll be adding a bunch of crypto-ish features to it such as pricing and info as well as cleaning up or adding usability features.I figure it might give people a place to network with other crypto junkies without all the clutter of everything else you get on sites like fb & twitter.Check it out! There will be a random draw from the user profiles (that have profile pictures and posts) for a $100 worth of crypto to be given away.If you like the idea, awesome! If not, please don't spoil the fun. If nothing else this is just something for me to dabble with.

I like the idea of a social network for people who all like and are interested in bitcoin. It could be a place where people who are invested in and are interested in bitcoin can 'gather' and discuss things as they relate to bitcoin. I think I would call it <truncated> you wanted to use a simpler term for discuss, maybe you could replace discuss with talk, so you would call it bitcointalk

I think it will get more attention if you move this to the local section but it seems there is no Canada option in the local section. Anyway, I found a Canadian community in other languages try to post there to hire someone who lives in Canada.Here's the section. <link> option, make a new thread here ""Services section"" just add the amount you want to pay on the title so that it's more attractive to those who seek payment.It seems that FinderOuter is not hard to set up why not try to read this first below.- <link> down to find the guide on how to use it.I also suggest you make an issue on this link <link> so that they can help you how to install FinderOuter.

Topic: Less Worry: Celcius paid off its $114 million Bitcoin-backed loan in 24 hours.
### Original post:
Users of the crypto lending platform have finally felt some relief following Celcius Network's announcement that it has paid a total of $114 Million of its Bitcoin loan in the last 24 hours, lowering its liquidation price to $4,967This means that the Bitcoin price must fall below $4,967 before Celcius is <truncated> Reading: <link>

### Reply 1:
Why is Celsius paying-off debt? Of course, lowering the liquidation price for their WBTC. I got you! But, this was important when liquidation price was around 20k. Now it's <3k, and they're still paying off debt. Anyone knows the reason for this? How is this seen in the light of a potential bankruptcy? You are not allowed to choose, whom you pay off and whom not, when filing for bankruptcy. It does not make really sense to me.

### Reply 2:
instead of being in debt to some class action suit of millions of customers. they have relieved the customer debt(users of locked coin). by replacing it with corporate debtin short.a corporation injected them with alot of cash. which they bought up alot of coin.now they have more coin holdings which they can put up as more collateral behind the scenes to save off any liquidation. there is ~$440m of coins <truncated> and G.Sachs just handed them $2b to pull them out of the water of liquidation.this means they are out of the customer liquidation pond and now in the G.Sach debt lake

Topic: Global Charities: Salvation for Bitcoin
### Original post:
Bitcoin is in trouble.You may not agree with me, but at least hear me out (or read me out, since this is being written).For Bitcoin to succeed in the long run, it has to be widely adopted internationally, vendors, online retail companies, individuals, college students and your grandma all have to be able to use Bitcoin easily. The price can't be so volitile that it scares away regular folk. The price must be predictable enough that the factory in Vietnam will accept bitcoin for the products it is manufacturing for the market in Australia, and to pay for the raw material it gets from Brazil.What can kill bitcoin is having no exchanges to buy bitcoin. Or, if regular people cannot easily transfer fiat currency into an exchange to buy Bitcoin. Bitcoin won't survive if the only way to trade it is in person from someone met online or through OTC trades on irc freenode #bitcoin-otc.Unlike so many bitcoiners, I am not lent to believe in conspiracies.

Topic: How a social attack could defeat a prosperous Bitcoin network
### Original post:
In this thread I will propose a simple legal and social approach which will allow a government entity to take control over Bitcoin with minimal resistance. This attack is, in a way, much simpler than the various technical ones (building a super computer, etc).There have been a number of threads in this forum regarding ways a freedom-hostile entity, usually a government, could take control over Bitcoin and destroy its benefits such as inflation resistance and privacy. These threads so far have focused on the idea that the entity would either set up a super computer to become the largest miner in the world, or that the entity would hunt down the largest miners in existence and regulate/coerce them. The usual counterargument is that Bitcoin is too small to warrant that kind of attention, and later it will be too large to effectively mount such <truncated> the very popularity of a large Bitcoin network would open it up to being taken over by tricking the average uneducated user.

If this attack works, I suggest it should be tried on p2p filesharing networks first as a test. <truncated> that basically been tried? I don't think many people would use a non-open-source Patriot Edition.

### Reply 2:
Any closed source client would be prodded and reverse-engineered by the open source community. Even if this somehow doesn't expose the backdoor controls, any use of code that can be shown to have been taken from the open source community would expose the closed source client to using the copyright laws against them. This would not be the first time that China had been caught doing such things.In short, I'm not worried about it.

Topic: I started spending my bitcoins ;)
### Original post:
Hi,Just thought I'd write here to say that I have sent two bitcoins to a relative via bitmail asking her to spread the word. I also spent about 3 or 4 coins on a website to buy bitcoin fridge magnets and vinyl stickers. I'm going to put the sticker in my mining room. One of the fridge magnets is for me and the other one will go on the work fridge. There are 70 people working in my office.I may very very attach an article on what it is aswell. Give people something interesting to talk about over break. I'll make sure the article includes info the hideous charges the credit card companies are getting away with.Anyway the most important thing for me is that I have put some currency into the economy which is required if it's to grow. Even if you want to hoard because you believe the value will go up over time I'm not sure that will happen unless the economy grows. It's in your interest to put a percentage of your coins to help it grow.Also, I would have spent my bitcoins earlier but I have only started mining in July and just have myself more organised now. I was up the walls for the last two months getting everything configured.

### Reply 1:
For me the dilemma between saving and spending is mostly not related to the expectation of a higher price in the future. The most important factor is where can I spend coins and what can I buy with them. I live a fairly minimalistic lifestyle and don't really need that much. I'll spend coins when I find something useful to spend them on.I do understand that people spend coins simply because it's fun to try and buy something with coins for the first time. I don't do that because I generally don't buy anything unless I really need it.However I'm a Bitcoin-enthusiast and I think that the options for buying stuff, goods or services, will become ever larger as Bitcoin grows. The market has already grown massively in the recent months. This is why I'm not just saving everything, I got two different spending accounts already set up with more than enough Bitcoins for small purchases. One on my desktop and one on my Android phone. The savings I keep in a safe offline location.This is to say that I hope the merchants keep at it, because I will start spending more coins when I find something really useful to spend them on. Using coins is very convenient and cheap so why not, and the added ano<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 2:
+1This is it. I mean, we're reaching the stage where we can actually offer an easy way to start accepting Bitcoins, using Bit-Pay or other advanced merchant services. This is something I've been planning to work on, not only from an online standpoint but in the real world.The Bit-Pay mobile payment system changes the potential for physical stores to another level. I feel Bit-Pay will get competitors in the future that will copy their model and if I were them I would start a massive affiliate program as soon as possible.An affiliate program would mean that basically anyone could try and convert their favourite stores to Bitcoin, using Bit-Pay, and then Bit-Pay would pay them a percentage of some sort. In fact I think I'll ask if they're interested in implementing something like this.This would help a lot because there would be added incentive for everyone to get stores to accept Bitcoin.

Topic: How can we fasten the transaction of payment in BITCOIN paying high fees?
### Original post:
It seems that even you pay fees when transacting or sending through blockchain with bitcoin, you still have to wait for a mean time or maybe a long period of time, but there is a free of charge in sending bitcoin and when you look at the blockchain you ride along with another sender/hash that is paying a fee, is it unfair or there is a logically explanation behind it?.

### Reply 1:
To get a confirmation, your transaction has to be included into a block. Unfortunately, blocks aren't fixed at 10 minutes. Varience can cause the blocks to be up to several hours apart and your transaction will not have one confirmation until then no matter how much fees you paid.Fees acts as a deterrence against spam and as an income for miners. If the fees doesn't exist, spam attacks would take little to no cost and miners would not have any income after the block reward becomes 0.Miners, although majority choose to queue transactions by fees/size, they can choose to exclude certain transactions even though they may have high fees.

### Reply 2:
It is not guarenteed that if you broadcast your transaction with a high fee you will get it included at the next block.At the last months bitcoin became more popular so it is pretty hard to have you transaction included in the 1st block that comes out unless you include a very high fee.

Topic: Do Your Part and Dont Kill BTC
### Original post:
A) It's that time of year where everything drops,B) We all knew about the volatility before we started.Now for the kicker; BTC works a lot like fiat (from what I can tell). In the fiat market, when people are not spending, the value drops considerably. If money is not changing hands then it becomes worthless. Everyone on here saying ""Be strong and HODL"" are not helping. The more we use it, the more demand there will be. Companies see it working for competition and they are more likely to adopt. Fees are practically non-existent now so there is no excuse.I will be treating crypto just like fiat going forward. Keep a healthy amount in reserve, save some, and allocate a certain amount for spending. I even decided to use crypto to hire a developer for an app I've been putting off for 2 years now.Will you spend a little more due to drops? Sure. But that is a small price to pay if you want to be a part of the growth and future of crypto.

That's the spirit! but I think that cryptocurrency and Fiat are the same, if you are saying that fiat's price is dropping because of people not engaging in using them they in Cryptocurrency the more you hodl the more it increase, well right now we can see that the price is in a resistance state because of people converting bitcoin to fiat and I really think that if we do our part we can simply say to just hodl and wait for the price to pump again, But this is not possible because we can not control the decisions and emotions of certain hodlers,

### Reply 2:
Problem is bitcoin is not yet prepared to be used as a payment system. Right now it is slow and transaction fees are high, the price fluctuation scares companies away. Unless these problems are addressed, bitcoin will never move from store of value to a reliable mode of payment. We all wanted to utilize bitcoin the way it was intended to be but right now it is not yet feasible.

*I've been up for 30 Hours, Please forgive grammar mistakes and small scuffs in my logic.*So im sitting here and I'm listening to all of these Bitcoin advocates, a few being Roger Ver, Erik Voorhees, etc etc and they are preaching about the inevitability of bitcoin becoming ""the"" global currency in the face of widespread collapse of the banking system <truncated> at first that made sense to me, if fiat fails why wouldn't people convert to bitcoin. Thats where that B.S for the $1 Million dollar btc comes from. BEST CASE SCENARIO for btc adoption right? Well not quite. We know that Bitcoin is not truly decentralized, it's the closest thing we have but lets face it, the fact that one country(a few pools) controls the most of the ENTIRE network's hash rate is a failure of decentralization. I will call it ""Geographic Centralization"". My only issue with geographic centralization is that a bitcoin revolution could easily be shut down by a governing body, and if that does occur the network would be crippled after losing 70% of the hash rate. So with that being said. I present two scenariosA:IF Mass adoption* occurs then the centralized systems (or players) will consolidate their position ""<rest of post truncated>

I think the OP was reading my posts in another thread:<link> TPTB_need_war's posts in the ""Bitcoin IS destroyed"" thread.How do you calculate that Blockstream is for small blocks Blockstream is for making sure they and the Chinese mining cartel control how fast the block size increases, so they can squeeze maximum transactions fees that the market will bear. You could read the Reddit discussion between Professor Jorge Stolfi and TPTB_need_war, which explained this.And SegWit is all about centralization of validation, so that we get a 666 enslavement system. Do you think the powers-that-be invested $70 million in Blockstream for no reason. Come on. You don't think (Mr. ZIRP and Russian oligarchy maker) Larry Summers (who is on the board of 21 Inc.), Peter Thiel (BitPay, gifted $100k to Vitalik @ Ethereum, etc), and other banksters elite are in on that. Come on.There is only one possible way you defeat those bastards. And that is to make something so popular, that can't be centralized.

This quote shows also that he's probably not that young since he knows about the time sharing computers in the nineties. And indeed a great quote. Clearly showing the trust deficiency in the current money system.

He's not that young, and he's been writing about economic theory for quite some time. You can see his blog here: <link> In 1993, he also described how to maintain a pseudonomous identity online, which is seemingly working pretty well for him to date: <link>

Topic: Bitcoin is the creation of Satoshi from zero to one
### Original post:
I have been reading and writing on bitcointalk recently. I try to write my understanding of Bitcoin in the past few years and share it with you here. My words is mainly based on my deep thinking about Bitcoin. My original thinking was fragmented and unsystematic. Now I record my thinking process in the form of words and output it. Only in this way is it possible to aggregate fragmented information into systematic knowledge. At the same time, in the process of communicating with everyone, let my thinking be further improved. This is the benefit of the collision of ideas, so that you can continue to grow.Through the two days of posting and communication, I found that more and more people are understanding and approving Bitcoin. However, our understanding of Bitcoin may still be shallow. Many times we still cannot understand the essence of Bitcoin or the meaning it represents. We still can't fully feel the greatness of Bitcoin. In my opinion, Bitcoin is the quintessence of all the knowledge of mankind, and it represents a new civilization. The Bitcoin created by Satoshi is a complete creation from zero to one.What I want to say is that the knowledge system covered by Satoshi's creatio<rest of post truncated>

On the technical, coding side there is a lot of people who were capable of creating a system like Bitcoin, as evidenced by the amount of altcoins that are now created. Okay, so yeah a lot of them use Bitcoin as the foundation, but they also come with their own different flavours, and improvements. However, Satoshi didn't only have to code the whole thing, he had to think of the idea, and try to use hindsight on predicting what the world would look like in 10, 20 years, and beyond. He had to come up with an idea, and solution on how to keep Bitcoin having a constant injection into the economy, while not releasing too much too early. So, he implemented difficulty, which sort of regulates the amount of Bitcoin in circulation at a time. He also had to come up with a way of securing the transactions, and this is probably the most impressive part of the whole thing. Implementing something which prevents double spending, isn't something that a lot of people could do, well at least thinking of the solution, and then implementing it. I don't think Satoshi is as super human as people tend to think of them as though. However, they saw a problem, and implemented a solution. There are definite <rest of post truncated>

Topic: Future of digital money depends on smart phone technology and people's knowledge
### Original post:
All of us - the people present on this forum all know Bitcoin and all coin famous.But I think the future development of digital currencies to replace banknotes or banks depends greatly on one of the following factors:1. Qualifications and knowledge of the people. Because the majority of people today do not fully understand block-chain and technology. So if you want to use cryptocurrency like paper money today, all people have to know how to use technology2. Smart phones - Must be integrated with technology to make it convenient for people to use3. Simplification of cryptocurrency developers. How can people easily use like paper money.And what do you think about my opinion?

### Reply 1:
Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general will grow despite:1. People not knowing how blockchain technology works just as they do not know how money really works. They only need to know how to spend it. Creating and exploring Facebook is much more complicated than using a Bitcoin wallet. And besides, it is always either you bend or you break. That is one truth in life. 2. It is not Bitcoin that needs to adjust; the smartphones do.3. Cryptocurrency development is a very complicated thing and only selected individuals around the world are capable enough to get involved in it. The rest do not need to know, much less learn, crypto development. As I've said, people only need to learn how to spend and perhaps keep it securely. Well a choice of wallet may take care of it. Crypto is much easier to use actually. They don't even need to count the change or do mathematics every time one spends, unlike with fiat.

### Reply 2:
I fully agree on the potential of smartphones towards widespread use and acceptance of Bitcoin, cryptocurrency in general and the blockchain technology. Tied to the popularity of smartphones is the coming revolution of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) which can be synergistically working with the blockchain and cryptocurrency as well. In short, the smartphone can be acting like a hub for the user to access all of these technologies and developments. And when we are talking about education, things can now be simplified as more and more people are carrying smartphones. Now, we actually don't need (though it can be a good advantage) for people to fully understand cryptocurrency beyond the basics or the <truncated> level what is important is that people understand how they can participate in cryptocurrency and how they can claim their stake on it. Any new technology that can game-changing will always have a learning curve and can face resistance on the market but after getting around the critical mass level things will be changing. I am expecting the same thing can happen with the blockchain and cryptocurrency especially with Bitcoin.

Topic: Does Peter Vessenes have giant holdings in BTC??  If so, why crash it?
### Original post:
I was just pondering some thoughts on the fact the Coinlab is suing Mt. Gox. Some people are speculating that it could be fatal to BTC but then I would think if Peter Vessenes has a good number of BTC (Which I assume he does) then why in the world would he want to undermine his own BTC? It does not make any sense. I can see him doing this just to ""stir the pot"" so to speak so he can get a better exchange service up and running, but I don't think people should panic. I highly doubt Peter Vessenes wants nothing other than to make BTC grow and is willing to do whatever it takes to do that. Any thoughts?

### Reply 1:
It's all speculation at this point. We don't know all the details, and who's really pulling the strings. We do know that Venture Capital is involved, and when things are not moving as expected, I would think these guys have a voice.As for MtGox, they've had lots of things to deal with lately, and as such, the transition may not have been in the front of their minds. I don't know. Coinlab has claimed that MtGox has tried to 'ban' some of the Coinlab customers, but I know no details about this.Also we do not know under what conditions the initial agreement was made. There are many things that's unclear at this point.

Topic: Bitcoin Calendar and Important Days
### Original post:
Bitcoin is not just a digital currency , but a revolution and for some its like following a religion ... Days on which bitcoin is celebrated .. Here are some which i mentioned , if somehow missed any please feel free to add ... and also share your opinion about what you feel about specific days out of this list ... Have u ever contributed or u have any experience of any of such days ...January 3 - Bitcoin Day January 11 - Bitcoin Running Day January 27 - Silk Road DayFebruary 24 - Mt.Gox Day March 9 - Cypherpunk Day April 5 - Satoshi's DayMay 10 - Lightning Day May 22 - Bitcoin Pizza Day August 1st- Bitcoin Independence Day August 21- Bitcoin Infinity Day October 31 - Bitcoin Whitepaper Day November 4 - Bitcoin Logo Day November 8 - Shitcoin Day December 18 - HODL Day

### Reply 1:
To be very honest, i don't know most of these days expect a few. Even i don't see people talking about them on those days mentioned.Among all these days, it was bitcoin pizza day which is known to everyone and some of people celebrate it too. I have seen people share the bitcoin pizza day pictures here on bitcointalk where they have decorated pizza with some bitcoin designs and celebrated.

### Reply 2:
For, I am only familiar with ""Bitcoin pizza day"" which represents the day an individual bought two pizzas with over 10,000 Bitcoins worth $40 back then, and I have no idea about the rest. But I think there are some days here that make no sense and I don't see any reason why they are important to Bitcoin in any way, such as Independence Day, Bitcoin Infinity Day, Bitcoin Whitepaper Day, Bitcoin Logo Day, Bitcoin Day, and HODL-day. Because I think these days makes no sense, but it would have nice if only had you explained it a more better

Topic: What is the best platform to raise funds in the crypto world?
### Original post:
I was wondering what do you guys think is the best platform to raise funds if someone wants to raise funds from within the community without involving a VC?

### Reply 1:
You can probably go to the Project Development section of this forum. In order to potentially get any money you will probably need to have a detailed business plan, although with somewhat of an established business, in other words you will probably not receive funding from an idea alone.

### Reply 2:
it is near impossible to raise funds, that ship kinda sales years ago with everyone establishing themselves as a real trusted charity. most people will just question you and say you are not legit here. to many scams.

Topic: Jamie Dimon Says He's Done Talking About Bitcoin
### Original post:
JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon has said he won't be commenting on bitcoin anymore.It's a statement that comes a month after his now-infamous declaration that the cryptocurrency is a ""fraud."" Dimon made the remarks during a third-quarter earnings call with reporters this morning, as cited by CNBC.He reportedly said:""I wouldn't put this high on the category of important things in the world, but I'm not going to talk about bitcoin anymore.""Source: <link> after bitcoin hits its new all time high earlier today he realizes that he was wrong? And finally the clown stops spreading false informations. What are your thoughts?

### Reply 1:
I dont care. Most of us are done with listening to guys like him. Bitcoin was created as an alternative to the system he is an important part of so its not surprising that criticism comes from it. I think it is positive to be able to weigh different opinions and consider criticism towards bitcoin but what its not positive is to listen to FUD from establishment.

### Reply 2:
He better be not talking about Bitcoin or manipulating market in any way just for company's profit. I don't think that this statement came as a setback of his earlier statement going wrong. But because he encountered huge criticism for him calling Bitcoin a fraud and creating a fud for buying Bitcoin at dip. Other bankers of the Wall Street are in favor of Bitcoin and are thinking of providing crypto related services. JPMorgan certainly can't lose that opportunity by being wary of Bitcoin and losing off their competitors. This is simple business.

Topic: Hacker Stole 1,000 Traders Personal Data From CryptoTrader.Tax
### Original post:
A hacker has stolen data on more than 1,000 users from CryptoTrader.Tax, an online service used to calculate and file taxes on cryptocurrency trades.The hacker broke into a CryptoTrader.Tax marketing and customer service employees account on a support center platform, according to a source who came across the hacker on a dark web forum. With this access, the hacker could see customers names, email addresses, payment processor profiles and messages sometimes containing cryptocurrency incomes.The hacker then screengrabbed samples of this sensitive information, posted them on the forum to entice potential buyers of the data trove and sent additional pictures to the source, who shared this evidence with CoinDesk.David Kemmerer, a co-founder and the chief executive of CryptoTrader.Tax, confirmed to CoinDesk that a hacker gained unauthorized access on April 7 to the marketing and customer service employees account.

### Reply 1:
I'm just wondering how they know the other information such as the passwords are not in custody of the hacker. It is not unbelievable to see hacker stealing information but it become worrisome when they have direct access to your account. The hacker might not compromise the password by changing it but might know the passwords. This is part of the reason why people have not supporting centralized platforms

### Reply 2:
Sounds more like an inside job as without the proper authorization no one can access the account of an employee or the employee was a dumb.Other reason can be that CryptoTrader do not have the highest level of security features or firewall activated in their system.Anyways it is big dent to their reputation and trust.

If you aren't believing in this kind of service, then I suggest you to use Bitcoin Core. Because you are the only one who can manage your own money there, and you also the only one that has to take the risk of the money.Or you can also use any other wallet, I. Paper Wallet, Cold Wallet, or Brain Wallet.

A ""thought"" just shot through my mind:Seeing all these ""advertisements"", I quickly realized that instead of spreading the word about BTC, we should HUSH! and not speak a word about it!I'd like to quote satoshi here:Although attraction from unwanted sides is part of the picture, there is an even bigger, more important reason to keep this amongst us, at least as far as possible...The bigger reason is that a quick spread of word favors the already patronized ""early adopters"" even more! But not only that - early adopters are benefiting in a compounding, exponential fashion, widening the gap between the ""haves"" and the ""have-nots"" even more. If the reason for this is not instantly obvious, let me explain: say you own 10 BTC for $15 each, giving you $150. An early adopter owns 1000BTC for $15 each. Now word spread and noobs start buying into BTC, making the price rise to say $20 for a coin.This situation massively favours the early guy, making him a profit of $5000 USD, while the ""little guy"" only earns $50 USD. Since mining and buying is equally costly/difficult for both of them, we can assume that under the condition of both players continuing to mine/buy, time will even the gap.If bot<rest of post truncated>

(snip the quote)Agreed. There is no hurry for bitcoin to grow in price. Slow and careful development of the technology will lead to long term profits for anyone willing to invest the time into bitcoin.

The early adopters deserve their fortune. They took on the risk back when Bitcoin was new and when its future wasn't clear. In this case, their investments (mining hardware and/or money, time) paid off, but it could've gone either way.

A lot of mobile wallets are out there can really make that happen and if other prostitutes around the world get inspired by this article they can also start to accept Bitcoin.The only problem that I see here would be the fees because where I am located you can sometimes in some remote villages find a prostitute for just 5 EUR or like 10-20 EUR in cities,I am not talking about escorts that cost like 300-500 EUR for night.Many people would be turned down by fees if fees in the Bitcoin network are high at the moment of the ""meeting"".

### Reply 2:
If you read the news shared by the stompix, you will find that it is not about only bitcoin, but all the cryptocurrencies. This means that prostitutes can take money in litecoin, dogecoin or any other crypto currencies where they do not have to pay the fee and also the transaction speed will be fast. The big question remains that are all the prostitutes are so educated that they know how the crypto currencies work

Who cares if it is subsidiary. There are enough of allegations against the major JP Morgan too, the original Wall Street giant. Who doesn't knows the famous mortgage crisis.

Topic: Lessons from Facebook and the attempted shutdown of Telegram
### Original post:
Do you guys believe that bitcoin will fluctuate less due to bad news?Just like Facebook can pass government regulations, as well as telegram did today, I belive Bitcoin and descentralized technology won't be affected by such attempts and people will realize that. Therefore, leading to less sudden drops. I hope I was able to explain my point. What do you guys predict?

### Reply 1:
I think you meant to say that bitcoin will be less influenced by governmental regulations than centralized entities such as facebook and telegram?While your point has merit, it is also easily argued against. While bitcoin itself cannot be controlled or regulated, the users of it can be, governments instead will pass regulation on how much bitcoin someone can hold, what level of verification is needed, etc etc. In order for bitcoin to be truly free from the influences of regulation from a price point of view it would need for the community to be completely free of governments control, which sadly is not a reality.

### Reply 2:
Facebook and google not ban bitcoin but they ban cryptocurrency related ads. It is not related to bitcoin. There are many ways to advertise. The biggest suporters are via from bounty in bitcointalk. It is very targeted market to spread out ICO. In the end, facebook and google ban effect nothing to bitcoin.

Topic: Creating a module for new BitCoin sites
### Original post:
With PayPal freezing the accounts of BitCoin traders, one of the most effective approaches is to consider the many other services out there that would enable conventional currency <-> BitCoin transactions. The idea would be to have interested users evaluate the various options, and then build a site which allowed users to forward money to it and have it purchase BitCoins from other users as they became available.These new sites could provide an interface to various credit card processors and many ATM services, as well as online banks and friendly credit unions. Plenty of opportunities for relationships can be formed, and new sites created within the community would be able to make that happen.To allow these new sites to be created, a Drupal module is being developed to allow essentially anyone to create their own site in Drupal, free, open-source and known for being very easy to create with no programming knowledge. All the programming is done by module writers, and site creators merely need to plug the module in and configure it with a point-and-click interface.The author of the module is asking what features the community would like. And since there is so much demand within the B<rest of post truncated>

### Original post:
I think every bitfool should spend at least 3 months learning the trade of 'btc hacking', THEN&ONLY THEN will your BTC be secure.Trouble is 99% of the entire BTC racket is based on non-reality bullshitOnce U know all the tricks of the hacker, then U can 'take care' of your BTC until then your just putting your trust into the hands of the criminal exchanges, and mining-pools.These days' it can honestly be said that more money is made 'hacking' BTC than mining, just like the 1920's ppl robbed banks cuz that's where the money is, now hackers rob BTC, cuz that's where the easy money is, and for now, its not even a crime that can be enforcedThe nature of BTC since day one has always been 'non-recourse' which to the criminal minded means ""GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD FOR LIFE""...Long ago ppl asked ""Why do U rob banks"", the robbers said ""Because that's where the money is""Today, with BTC criminals can rob people, and never fear jail, or being chased by the police,It's almost like the CRIMINAL CARTEL US-MURDER, INC (ZOG-GOV) created BITCOIN so that the world could be a paradise for criminals.

### Reply 1:
Last week BTC was over $20k, what's your point?My point was we're always told that mining is better than hacking, I don't think that's true, its now virtually impossible to mine BTC unless you have a farm of Antminer S-9's (china), on the other hand any IDIOT can hack other Bitcoin idiots with ease.

Topic: Colored coins made easy?
### Original post:
Ok, I've looked into the various different colored coin options out there and it seems strange that there should need to be wallets and protocols built around it.Couldn't I just declare an address as the source and any addresses transferred to from there are then colored?For example:I start a new company and want to use colored coins for stocks.In the company bi-laws, announcements, website, basically every official location for the company so that it is publicly available, we announce the starting Bitcoin address <truncated> fill it with 100 bitcoinsThen we specify that every .0001 bitcoins is worth 1 share of the company.When someone buys 1 share then from the 100 bitcoins .0001 bitcoins is sent to a public key that they specify. They now own that share. They can now sell it if they want or just keep the private key and hodl.Since the blockchain keeps track of every transaction you could just have a website tracking that first 100 bitcoin address and any transactions from there. Any future share actions can easily pull up all of the addresses and their share amounts.Dividend payment would be easy because you just send it to each public key based on the balance amount. Someone mig<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
I was just wondering, how do you picture that you buy a share? With fiat money through a bank transfer? It would make little sense to send 0.001 to get 0.001 in return. Unless the price of one share would be 1 BTC, then will you send 1 BTC to get a share (in form of 0.001) in return. What will den prevent the company to just issue new shares. Could be misunderstod as a ponzi scheme.

### Reply 2:
If it is established that the 1 share represents more than just the .001 bitcoin then that value and scarcity would give it added value.This 5 cent nickel was purchased for over $3 million.

Topic: Bitcoin vs Apple Pay
### Original post:
The debate between bitcoin and Apple Pay rages on, as early adopters weigh the differences and advantages of either particular system. Apple Pay, announced as a payment system which could allow payments to be made directly from the iPhone among other Apple devices, was announced in 2014 and has many of the Apple loyal raving its potential for friction-less commerce. Bitcoin likewise, is a payment system which promises to make a leap into electronic exchange, yet has very important distinctions between what Apple is aiming for with their platform.BITCOIN VS APPLE PAYMARKET CAPITALIZATION 2015 ($ MILLIONS)The Apple Pay infrastructure can be seen as an overlay network ontop of our everyday purchases in the way we conduct the transaction. The bitcoin technology is a deeper, more core aspect of what this infrastructure entails because it not only radically alters the way we conduct the transactions, but the type of value we transact.Read the full article on Diginomics.

### Reply 1:
You can't expect the dumb herd to pick something called ""Bitcoin"" over something called ""Apple Pay"".We'll need more years of being bitchslapped by banks and goverments until they get the point.

### Reply 2:
We can say apple pay is designed for apple users to pay for their stuffs online. Bitcoin is digital currency will be unique and biggest invention for the last 500 years. This is revolutionary digital currency which is to be explored yet. Apple has wealth to support it's paying service but can not be not compared with bitcoin.

Dear Bitcointalk family,I have prepared a free PDF which aims to provide a comprehensive template and body-of-knowledge for bitcoin evangelists to use to promote Bitcoin to merchants. This is especially useful if you have access to a sales affiliate program with a major exchange and/or payment processor, or if you are a significant holder of BTC who wishes to see BTCs value rise on the back of healthy and well-justified merchant and consumer adoption.Reddit Thread: <link> PDF: <link> MS Word Version & Excel Spreadsheet: <link> wish you all the best in your Bitcoin promotion efforts!

I read and downloaded the document without paying anything,or did I miss something?

### Reply 2:
I do not think it's a good idea, to draw people to a site, saying they have documents for people, to promote bitcoins to merchants, and having them pay, to read the documents. Rather put a donation button on your site, and have people willingly pay for the information.

Topic: Is Bitcoin the New World Digital Currency?
### Original post:
<tinfoilhat>""Total global economic collapse and the introduction of a new world digital currency....""<link> people who are afraid of the New World Order have often accused Bitcoin for being the New World Digital Currency and thus Bitcoin is believed to be evil. It's weird to think that Bitcoin could actually be an important piece of the Illuminati's plan.So, let's say Bitcoin and the block chain technology were never invented. What would be the new world digital currency then? Could it be the debit/credit card system? Apple pay? Just to try and take the position of a devil's advocate in this situation, is there any realistic possibility of how Bitcoin could turn out to be the new world digital currency that the referred video is talking about?</tinfoilhat>

### Reply 1:
I recall from Faust about Mephistopheles that he intends to do evil but his deeds always turn out to cause good. Perhaps it's the case with Bitcoin? That Illuminati invented Bitcoin to execute their evil plan but it goes terribly wrong Fact is that we need to have a store of value and a means to transfer value. In that sense Bitcoin is definitely the lesser evil.

### Reply 1:
this is not new! they have been working on it for a long time. the plan to create their own blockchain has been around for a couple of years now and they are working on it hard. but it won't be exactly the same cryptocurrency as we know. probably won't even be public or open source or anything like that. you will just have access to the wallet they issue and nothing else.in the end, no matter what is created, bitcoin remains the decentralized cryptocurrency that everyone knows. and theirs will be another altcoin a heavily centralized one this time.

### Reply 2:
Nothing will happen to Bitcoin, because banks are already working with virtual currencies using encryption right now. They will never issue a crypto currency, that a. is confirming transactions completely decentralized b. people can mine with their computers c. has a public ledgerd. has a limited amounte. is open sourcef. ...Means, that everything a bank will issue might even be called ""Cryptocurrency"", but it will definitely not replace the idea of Bitcoin.

The halfway point was probably around $30k when it could easily have dumped back to $20k for a long bear market, or pumped up to $40k and continued the bull run. Thankfully it looks like we're heading up towards the ATH again so it's a good time to invest - certainly better than buying at $60k!

### Reply 2:
Yeah we are not late, but i have doubts because of some fluctuation in the market and TBH i don't see any important news behind of this sudden increased in bitcoin.. It's very quite though. and only news after the bump all i can see which is there's no significant results around the internet. So how we can trust this mprovements that happening in BTC.? Maybe just good for short term.. So better luck next time for us who missed this opportunity to make quick profits. LmaoNevertheless if it keeps surging then its good no regrets probably it's not really for us.

Topic: How would this affect the network?
### Original post:
Reading the MaidSafe forum, someone asked how its network would cope if a government or other entity effectively and quietly cut off communications between countries or continents and so created two or more unlinked networks. So applying the question to Bitcoin, when eventually reconnected, how would these networks join back together and reconcile transactions with one another?

### Reply 1:
Didn't broadcast or forewarn of their intention to do it.

### Reply 2:
Would the Bitcoin network still function normaly within that country?Assuming that it did and was without connection to the larger network long enough for some transactions to occur and be confirmed before joining back, then is that a scenario allowed for in the protocol?

Topic: Poll: Do you use first-class messaging?
### Original post:
First-class messaging, where the ""Signatures"" tab is part of the main window, was originally the default mode of operation for the Sign Message GUI function, but was relegated to the menu by default due to uncertainty of how much use it would get. I think 0.6 has proven it useful (for example, Bitcoin OTC now uses it for primary authentication) and it should be given first-class by default. However, others disagree and even want to remove the option (to make it first-class) entirely. Supposedly I'm the only one who wants message signatures to be first-class. I am hoping this poll will prove the <truncated> messaging is a compile-time feature for Bitcoin-Qt 0.6. By adding the <truncated> option to qmake, builds will treat message signing the same way as other Bitcoin-Qt functions, instead of relegated to another dialog via the menu as it is by default. On Gentoo, users can enable it simply by installing with the ""1stclassmsg"" USE flag.Note that the Verify Message will be available with both first-class and second-class messaging.

Topic: Securities Trading with Blockchain
### Original post:
I am in fintech space responsible for platforms that trade bonds. I am starting to consider how blockchain technology can be used to facilitate the transfer of securities aspect from a buyer to seller. Here is the business scenario (expressed simply):1. Buyer meets Seller through an electronic platform. This is not as trivial as hitting a price on a screen as is the case in Equity or FX markets. There are number of Request-For-Quote, Order Based and Crossing systems that are designed to generate a trade between two parties whilst attempting to minimize the information leakage to the wider market in the process.2. For this scenario I am assuming buyer has found a seller without a broker intermediary through a crossing platform. Each party to the trade doesn't know the other party is i.e. it is totally anonymous. The crossing platform in my scenario has two functions. Firstly it enables each party to find the other and agree on the trade details. Secondly it is responsible for ensuring the security is transferred between two parties on the terms agreed to. The secondary aspect can be referred to as 'clearing'.3. Both parties have to trust the platform and the platform in return has t<rest of post truncated>

Topic: HTC releases smartphone in which you could actually run full node
### Original post:
Just read a good news and wanted to share:-A very renown company like HTC just released a smartphone which have full node capabilities in which the user can actually generate their own keys and even run transactions without the use of any extra software or wallet .They have also placed the price somewhat affordable like 250$ for per piece and this is something that is no other smart phone in the history ever did .What do you think will be the next step since more companies are now going to be influenced by what they did therefore ; the acceptance is now wide spread therefore we can expect the price to increase further .Is it beneficial ?What is it's scope in the future further ?

### Reply 1:
I like what HTC is trying to do here even though their mobiles are not very popular. I don't really know the technical stuff involved here, but the intention is great and other companies should follow suite. $250 is a pretty great price in this aspect and I will definitely check it out soon.

### Reply 2:
Is good that HTC make this type of phone, but maybe if is full node people will not let phone to run so much time for the node and running a node without rewards can not be like by some people.

Installed the app, went to the faucet site <link> to get free bitcoins. Successfully sent them to my bitcoin address, but where are they?The bitcoin app has been running for hours, racking up blocks, but shows zero transactions. Shouldn't I have a receive transaction and show the free bitcoins from the faucet?How long does it take and can there be some other thing wrong? The faucet site transaction page shows a confirmation that the bitcoins were sent.

### Reply 1:
Probably just a syncing issue as stated above. Go to block explorer and see what the current block is (most recent) and compare that to the block count in your client (lower right hand side of the window)

### Reply 2:
Go to blockexplorer.com and search for the address you gave the faucet. That will tell you the block number that the transaction was in. 5 BTC says your client's blockcount is lower than that.

Topic: Please explain to Homer how to store/backup bitcoins.
### Original post:
I have been researching this to death and cannot figure out how this works. Please help!If I were to store/backup bitcoins, can I store the same bitcoin in multiple places? My understanding is that a bitcoin is nothing more than letters and numbers. So I should be able to backup that bit coin in multiple places, including just writing down the public address and security key onto a piece of paper. I keep researching the different ways and there always seems to be a horrible con. Paper: Use the bit coin and any ""change"" is stored in a completely different place, not back to your paper wallet. Then you lose the ""change"" forever, because it is a new number, therefore you need a new paperwallet. PC: Can get hacked, or your computer crashes and you lose it. You can back it up on a USB, but what then? Did you not just backup that one bitcoin into multiple places? Online: Company goes bankrupt, you lose your coins. Company gets hacked, you lose your coins. Coinbase for example says they can keep it if they feel the need to do so. Now they offer a super secure vault that supposedly you control, they dont. Even if they go under, you keep your bitcoins. How in the hell is that possible? They<rest of post truncated>

I think you do not understand how bitcoin works. You don't own bitcoins. the bitcoins are stored in a ""blockchain"" under a certain address and you can make a transaction from this address if you have the correct private key. there are different type of wallets, wallets store your private keys. you can copy this private key and store it on different places. you can even have different type of wallets with the same private key. it is also possible to split your bitcoins on multiple wallets with different private keys.there are many tutorials about wallets and you should educate yourself if you don't want to risk losing bitcoins. some helpful links:<link>

Well i think you are not aware of bitcoin process and its advantages.i recommend you to go through the links which are given in above comments, those will make clear understanding of bitcoins.Even i will try to make some points clear.Bitcoins are Digital money and, every day thousand of merchant starts using them as payment. We all know how they are generated and how its works, let us see how are they stored and where they are stored? Well, Basically only store the secure digital keys which are used to access your public bitcoin addresses and to sign those all transactions . This data is stored in a bitcoin wallet which comes in a variety of forms. There are five main types of wallet Desktop or Laptop, Mobile,Web, Paper and Hardware. Of course, it is very important to safeguard and back up your bitcoin wallet.If you suppose to keep your private keys stored in any wallet, and if they are lost or whether it gets crashed or corrupted, then you will lose your keys ( information). Backing will automatically makes a copy of your private keys, but you need to back up your whole wallet and not only the private keys. Back up the whole wallet in several different places, and keep them safe f<rest of post truncated>

Topic: Article claims bitcoin mixers are no longer safe
### Original post:
I came accross this article <link> sure if this info is already known or not but I am interested in hearing peoples opinion on the claims that bitcoin mixers are no longer safe. It lists a few specifics ones there. The main questions are1. If this article is true, are there any mixers that work differently than the ones mentioned in this article?2. Would using 2 mixers help? For example sending the coins to a wallet using a mixer, then sending the coins somewhere else again using a different mixer to another wallet. So if one mixer is compromised, at lest you have the other to fall back on.3. Article states blockcahin analysis was used to track the bitcoins. Therefore making mixing completely useless since software and tools can now defeat them.

### Reply 1:
I disagree that mixers aren't safe anymore because the article only mentioned some mixers. I haven't used any of those mixers but I think it's possible to create a different mixer an example I could give is ChipMixer. Imo it depends on the mixers, if the two mixers you're using are similar to those above then it won't complicate things that much for them

### Reply 2:
So the article only mentions some of the mixers as an example, not to be taken literally.Source: <link> understandable to be skeptical about centrally operated tumblers, and AFAIK most of them (the tumblers) are centralized. Thus the anonimity rely on how they function. Here to see some research/discussion about this matter: <link>

Topic: Why not use Exchange instead of Mixer?
### Original post:
So, Mixers provide service of shuffling bitcoins or provide addresses loaded with bitcoins along with private keys. In short, they provide service so to create anonymity between sender's and receiver's address so that no one can trace the transaction.My question is why not use Exchanges? When we deposit funds on exchange, bitcoins get deposited on exchange's cold wallet. But when we withdraw funds, withdraw gets processed from exchange's hot wallet. So in short, it is very easy to do anonymous transfer by depositing funds on exchange and withdrawing to other addresses. Why to pay 1-3% fees on Mixers when it could be done for much less on Exchanges. Exchanges like Binance charge just 0.0005 BTC to process withdrawals.

### Reply 1:
In my opinion, it does not matter if you use a mixer or a centralized exchange to ensure anonymity - this is not good enough, and the possible negative side effects from both solutions are rather unpleasant. The need in both cases to trust a third party is something that contradicts the central idea of bitcoin. But in the absence of something better, this can be used carefully, aware of the risk.Yes, but theres a higher risk of getting bitcoins from the mixer, which can be marked as dirty.

### Reply 2:
I am sure we will choose what we feel comfortable. And if we feel that it is better to use exchange than the mixer, then we can choose the exchanges to send and receive bitcoin. But for some people who are not comfortable with that way, they will use a mixer because they care about their personal information. Besides that, they don't want to send any documents. Maybe they have their reason why they are comfortable with the mixer, and we have a different way of deposit and withdraw bitcoin.

### Reply 1:
Well, i'm pretty sure not directly. I've checked for you on localbitcoins and it seems like nobody is buying bitcoin with travelers checks, and no centralized exchange will do this for you either pretty much because it's not a very safe way of depositing money(could be reported stolen etc.).What you can always do is though:a) exchange bitcoin to your fiat currencyb) go to your bank branchc) buy travelers checks from them.IT's a hassle though and will involve fees. Just use cash, man. Why do you even need checks? I mean nobody accepts it anymore lol

Topic: What happens in the future when most Bitcoins are lost in limbo?
### Original post:
What will happen, lets say around 2100, when most of the bitcoins are lost in the limbo?. See, by then (year 2100) almost 20 million bitcoins would have been mined, but also more than half of the bitcoins would be lost in limbo (lost in hardware wallets or web wallets that were owned by people who died and didnt give their passwords, etc etc to someone else in time). Eventually most of the bitcoins will be lost in the limbo with no way of recovering them. What happens then?, will it dissapear or will they have to add more decimals to the few remaining bitcoins?.At least with Gold, if you die someone can recover/find the Gold (unless you bury it in a very remote place in the eath). But bitcoins can never be recovered if permanently lost.So, what will happen in the future when 90% or more of the bitcoins are permanently lost in the limbo?. Maybe the remaining bitcoins will become a very valuable ""collector's item"" or something?

### Reply 1:
You have no idea what you're saying; do a little more research. 90% of bitcoins will not be lost lol

### Reply 2:
even each bitcoin has an intrinsic property. you can divide naturally up to the 8 decimal. just use only 1 btc it means 100milion of satoshi each unit. but we can also agree one day for a new algorithm were it's also possible to divide each btc for 10 or 12 decimal. by itself it's impossible see bitcoins in a limbo.

Topic: While Everyone was Talking about El Salvador! We forgot about Guatemala
### Original post:
We all know El Salvador was the first country to officially accept Bitcoin as its legal tender. We do know the problems El Salvador has been facing after that, many here would not accept it but the truth cannot be suppressed. In the meantime, Guatemala which neighbors El Salvador has been busy adopting Bitcoin the right way. Like El Salvador Bitcoin was never forced onto Guatemala. Their economy is far better than their neighborhood yet every local has shown an inclination toward Bitcoin. I was surprised when I saw it on Youtube. I came across this video which will prove that Bitcoin can only succeed in a country when everyone accepts it and knows its value through grass root penetration. I mean everyone here came together when someone recommended Bitcoin.The Untold Secrets of Guatemala's Bitcoin Lake

### Reply 1:
I thought it's new, but actually Guatemala already friendly with Bitcoin since the last year [1] but it's just underrated since the country is small and not accept Bitcoin as a legal tender, it's just similar with the other countries which accept Bitcoin as commodities and no have any rule about currency adoption. So these countries can use Bitcoin to buy anything ad long as the stores accept it.[1] <link>

### Reply 2:
Yes I agree with you @OP because I also believe that Bitcoin can only succeed in a country that it is generally accepted rathen in countries that has mixed feelings towards it.I think the wrong concept of Bitcoin is what is actually slowing the adoption of Bitcoin because basically most people see Bitcoin as a means of getting rich or a means of investment but rather the main concept of Bitcoin is to have a digital currency that helps fight against the monopoly of physical Fiat but just as a member of a forum said that the early adopter of Bitcoin were the ones that instilled the mindset of using the volatile nature of Bitcoin to comb in profit and ever since then, people are already trained towards such mindsets.Let's fix this mindset and watch the global adoption of Bitcoin.

Topic: Kim Dotcom Says Greece Will Crash Market; Buy Bitcoin and Gold
### Original post:
Internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom advised his followers to invest in either Bitcoin or gold, claiming that values will rise once Greece prompts the global market to crash again.Do you think it can really go that way? Should I buy some more Bitcoins then? And how soon it might happen?

### Reply 1:
They will never adopt Gold or Bitcoin; but perhaps another form of digital currency. Highly doubt it will be decentralized tho.. hehe

### Reply 2:
Kim Dotcom's only speculating that Greece will exit the EU, he can't predict the future. It's also difficult to predict what will happen to Bitcoin and gold prices if Greece exits the EU.Do your own research and make your own mind up based on it rather than relying on Kim Dotcom. I'd say it's 50/50 whether Greece exits the EU and not a foregone conclusion.

Topic: The Catch 22 Of Reality Of Crypto
### Original post:
One of the popular thoughts and beliefs on crypto especially Bitcoin. The belief is that Bitcoin should be the main money system in the world for getting goods and services vs just being a store of value. All of these ideas are written in the Bitcoin white paper.Reasons for Bitcoin is the constant ever growing amount of inflation that the current fiat systems of money that create for majority of the populations. However many have to realize that there are limitation from this happening. Not saying that it could or will happen though.For Bitcoin or any other new system to come into effect we need to have majority of the population to use and accept such a system.There are a many things standing in the way of this. One of those limitations is that there is nearly not enough effort on creating and spreading positive awareness on it as some government and individuals alike is hell bent on spreading negativity around and poisoning the minds of prospective users. People need to be aware and understand what bitcoin is really about and be awake to its uses.You could get lots of information about anything on the internet including bitcoin. But the internet can be misleading to newbies cause<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Completely misunderstood assumption I believe. First things first: bitcoin has not accomplished main stream adoption as of now so we can not really Call it main money system. I think thats what you trying to say with just different terminology. For bitcoin to be accepted throughout world needs some sort of regularities. Like every place I go there should be peeps, businesses, small to big shops accepting bitcoin as mode of payment. Going further online shopping sites with easy to make payment. Im not saying those systems which acts as middle party so that we can easily make crypto to fiat payments. It should be direct. But all of this not happening as of now. Even though we have some countries accepting bitcoin but there are more countries than that who do not like the idea of bitcoin. Moreover defining its value isnt fixed. Would be difficult to streamline product and services prices to unless you dont agree to state the price conversion 1BTC=1BTC

### Reply 2:
Arguably, people don't even realise that they actually need something. You know the amount of people I hear slagging off banks, and not trusting them? Then they're ignoring that there are alternatives despite saying ""But we're forced too"". People tend to just follow the trends, we are very much sheep penned in most of the time. I know its a hard thing to accept, but we've become pacified to the point where we actually believe we need x service, and y service. Sure, some people genuinely like the convenience, but I bet if you asked the majority of people without mentioning Bitcoin if they would like to be in full control of their money, without relying on third parties the majority would be interested. Bitcoin unfortunately has been dragged through the mud, and therefore there's a negative stigma to it.

Topic: Simple question - what is the root of the ""math"" that we are doing?
### Original post:
I've only been mining a couple weeks now, but with two GPUs and two CPU threads going I've amassed some coinage. I posted on a popular forum's distributed computing section what everyone thought of bitcoin and I've received some troubling replies. The one that gets me the most (and the one that I can't seem to find an answer to) is this: just what is all this hashing for? Is it really merely to find the next block, are we unknowingly cracking for some devious entity? It would appear that they will not accept the former as an answer, even though they all run F@H and WCG clients and can't truly trace the math they are doing either.

### Reply 1:
You're running SHA-256 calculations, trying to find a hash that is below a certain target number (correct me if I'm wrong on the hash part, I'm not 100% on whether we hash numbers or find the number to match the hash). So in effect you're making rainbow tables, which is encoded in the blockchain. It's an inefficient and unoptimized table though, so it doesn't really matter.No shady stuff here This is all determinable by looking at the source code, btw. You don't need to believe me.

### Reply 2:
Still,He makes a point. It would be a shame to to have all that hashing go to waste. I would like to look for collisions or at least report the collisions.

Whales cashing out bitcoin positions. Normal pattern during holidays.

It is relevant since Bitcoin's influence in crypto-currency markets. It is time to chill and enjoy these days with family. Merry Crhistmas to all!

No doubt, I just bought some bits. Hopefully they will payoff soon enough. I'm really surprised how BTC has nearly recovered it's price in such a short time. Soon it will completely recover and excel too.

Topic: formatting small numbers
### Original post:
let me propose formatting small <truncated> one is better to read?currently no standard to display small numbers.I know we use mBTC, uBTCbut not good for newbies.let me propose using commas at each 3 digits under decimal point.

### Reply 1:
First one is easier to read. Commas get in the way and are confusing when looking at the number. Makes me think we are talking millions instead of decimal places of bitcoin.

### Reply 2:
that will never work because you are changing the rules of showing numbers which is defined in math and it is not something you can just say lets use this way to see it better.besides you are not talking about a community of small number of people, you should think globally. all over the world people want to see this number and adding a "","" after the decimal point is only confusing. there are still many people who don't even know m=10e-3 and u=10e-6 which is pretty common and obvious, so adding a new thing that is also wrong will only create further confusion.

Topic: Bitcoin Wallet Suggestion
### Original post:
Hey all, what is the most recommended wallet for bitcoin? I've heard it's not good to store your bitcoin in online wallets as you risk losing what you store there.I've also seen the main bitcoin wallet, but it seems like it takes a while to download everything before you can use it? But is it the safest?Are there others that would be just as good?Sorry for such a basic question, and if this isn't in the right forum section. I have a lot to learn yet. Lol

### Reply 1:
I think I like the idea of keeping it on my computer instead of in an online wallet. Just something about trusting other people with my money makes me uncomfortable. Lol But I have heard of the blockchain wallet before. Is that like the official blockchain? So maybe more reliable? I'll look into electrum. Thanks!

### Reply 2:
It looks pretty easy to use. Maybe there would be reason to have both an online and offline wallet. Thanks for the suggestions!

Not personally. If I did then it would go straight back. It might be someone's abortion fund for all I know. By the sounds of it it happens when people have addresses stored and send to one from a previous transaction.

### Reply 2:
Someone sending to the wrong address is rare and never happened to me. But what I experienced, and I believe is much more common are small Bitcoin amounts around 0.0001 BTC which are sometimes send to many random addresses. For those curious, there is sometimes message on blockchain.info - probably promoting ponzi site (at least this happened to me few times).

This is script is amazing, i dont know how does it works, but it is good for me because we dont have too see those anoying ads anymore in the sites that are using this plugin.all those websites that are using it seems like they are earning hundreds of dollars everyday only by this revenue, and they are earning it in bitcoins, so it is more profitable for them.But a lot of people were mining cryptos without their concern, because a lot of them were using miners installed by a hacker.

Topic: A Science Fiction story idea: Using Bitcoin for ransom
### Original post:
Years ago, a friend of mine who was an actor and writer told me, Never rob a bank, instead write about it. That idea that dangerous activities could be explored trhough fiction has stuck with me. I myself would never break any laws or engage in any activity which was meant to harm anyone, or cause harm to their person or property. Despite that, it is always interesting to speculate. For example, who hasn't sat around with friends, and tried to come up with cool band names, or speculated on what they would do if they won the lottery. And, who hasn't had that most horrible and vulgar speculatvie conversation about how you would dispose of a dead body. Now, just because you sit around and speculate on such morbid thoughts doesn't mean you actually wold kill anyone. It is like talking about what you would do if you were Alexander the Great, or playing some multi-player role playing game in which you kill other players or their avatars.So there I was, thinking about naughty uses for bitcoin. And, as everyone who has ever watched thousands of hours of NCIS and Law and Order re-runs on Hulu+, the biggest danger in kidnapping someone, the place in the process where the kidnapper is most vu<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Why would they risk doing the kidnapping if they already had a nice lump of BTC?Why would they not just send the BTC's trough some mixing services and split it up into small wallets?They could also do some buying and selling of other cryptos to hide their tracks even more. Imagine using BTC to buy BBQ coins and then exchanging the BBQ coins for some Chinacoin before changing the chinacoin etc and in the end buy BTC again and selling for USD.

### Reply 2:
There is no need, use a mixer service to mix the BTC, then give out 5% to random people, then wait some time to spend the rest. So even ifthere are investigators tracking the movement of BTC (probably a unfruitful endeavor after the btc are mixed), they will be led on a wild goose chase and will give up.

Topic: Bitcoin on BBC 'Click'
### Original post:
Did anybody catch the segment about Bitcoin on the BBC click show?I'll post a link as soon as they publish it.But I thought it was a fair representation of the currency.What did you guys think?FFMG

### Reply 1:
Pretty fair piece, and decent explanation of the idea.

### Reply 2:
It was quite a well paced intro to how bitcoin works, but it did have some major omissions:A) The supply is predictable and capped. (21M was not mentioned at any point).B) It's been the best alternative investment on the planet for the last few years. (That's kind of crucial point when doing a news story on a new currency, no?)C) No mention of its global nature, A viewer could be forgiven for thinking that this new money only applies to the UK.Paraphrasing their summary of its value: ""It fluctuates wildly and could collapse at any time"". Talk about one sided.Still, no such thing as bad press. I'd air it daily if I was in charge.

Topic: BTC income & asset distribution?
### Original post:
Anyone can point me to data about BTC asset distribution (ex. a list of the 100 ""fattest"" wallets in a given time) and income distribution (ex. a list of the wallets who received more in a given time)?The ideal would be some graphic representation of the total BTC distributions in different times (even if I figure how misleading such data could be, given that every user has a random numbers of wallets).I ask because it could be interesting to see if such distributions are more or less egualitarian than fiat monies', and if their concentration seem to increase or decrease in time.Given the number of ""big swinging dicks"" so much capitalized on the GLBSE, and even due to other factors (like a couple of millions of ""sleeping"" BTC), I would not be surprised at all to find some extremely unequal distribution.

Yet even if small crashes occur and people loose money, this system is here to stay. No other comparison exist. BitCoin will not become a monetary system that will replace Banks. BitCoin will become the best alternative to banks on the other hand. Banks are not the ones with the problem in this, they will still have to lend money, process merchant accounts, insurance, re-fina<rest of post truncated>

We really can't be bothered any more than we already are with China and her ill decision concerning Bitcoin. The world had moved on without China and it should remain like that after the first ban. Bitcoin is surviving without China anf her miners.Is there really a country that doesn't do all that? Yet some are adopting the Bitcoin.

I hope people do know that this isn't just present in Crypto, insider trading is something that is grossly common across all types of securities and investments. Cause when there's money to be made, there are going to be ways to make it illegally -- happens all the time. Though, this isn't me trying to say it's OK -- I'm just saying that this was bound to happen as it happens in stocks, and of course is going to happen in crypto too.Regulations won't stop this, this is just incompetence by the government.

Topic: Proposal: create a child board for block size threads
### Original post:
There seem to be a lot of posters in the ""bitcoin community"" that have a single issue (""block size"") they bring up in every thread, regardless of the original topic posted. Maybe a child board could be created where these threads can live and the topic discussed ad naseum? It would be nice to again see more creative and varied content in here.

### Reply 1:
As you say, people bring it up in almost every thread, thereby derailing it from the intended purpose, so most threads would end up getting moved into the new subforum.My (more than a little biased) preference would be if people could provide a link to this thread when the topic does arise and direct people there. If we do have to discuss the topic, let's at least do it without the incessant flame war that usually accompanies the debate. We should also aim to change the narrative about the blocksize having to be a whole number, meaning we'd have to at least double it in one clumsy step. This would be far too <truncated> We can (and must) do better.(and no, the irony isn't lost on me that I've done exactly the thing the OP wanted to avoid )

This thread is a simple one. The bitcoin community welcomes all newcomers (minus paid fud trolls).When you first step into the bitcoin realm it can be intimidating... please consider that this is a family of geeks and investors... not always of mindset of keeping it simple... yet the bitcoin train is one crazy and exciting ride... don't give up.One thing you will learn is that there are always folks willing to help you understand and you should not be embarrassed to ELI5 (explain like I'm 5).Seriously, this is a completely addictive hobby that has far reaching financial impact personally & globally... the more you learn the more you want to be involved in this disruptive revolution... we were all nubes at one time. Hopefully our long term brainiacs can realize the importance of adoption and tone down the elitist attitude.Sooooo... welcome aboard... jump in... the water is warm... the tide is rising and the surf is incredible! What got you interested... and how can we help you better understand the real Satoshi's dream... Questions or comments?

Topic: Bitcoin Mining , Is it worth it?
### Original post:
Hello guys, I have a friend who told me about BITCOIN MINING. What do you think? Is it worth it ? Buying Hardwares / Mining Rigs and plus the TIME to be consume.I'm not even familiar with it , so I'm probably asking for advice on for those old miners.Electricity here in PH is so expensive. Do you have some tips and tricks? Thanks in advance guys !

### Reply 1:
It is not a good idea to do it now. There is a lot of competition happening and the difficulty gets higher.If you really are into mining then better look for another coin. But I bet there will be more out there considering popularity are in the hands of the ICO's now. They have their own number of coins and there is no mining needed.You will need a lot of capital for this to be successful.

### Reply 2:
Everyone has his own experience and his point of view, but it really does not look profitable and effective. Mining really needs a lot of capital to buy powerful equipment, and you will not get a quick profit. But if you have extra money, then why not try it.

Whipped this thing up during the Bitcoin Conference 2013, somewhere between the Tradehill party and just now:<link>

### Reply 1:
1. Because it has been proven to work in facilitating the transfer of products2. Because it has worked for 4.5 years, so it is building up a history of having worked reliably3. Because it is working right now, so there is a legitimate expectation that it will continue to work

Topic: Blockchain question for Bitcointalk
### Original post:
Are mutable blockchains, blockchains or databases?What makes a blockchain ""a blockchain"", and what makes ""a blockchain"" a database? Is there a technical answer to it, or is it philosophical?I have read/listened to many debates about it, but it never arrived to a ""correct answer"". Is there an actual correct answer?

### Reply 1:
In principle, Blockchain is repository of information that is distributed, permissionless, immutable and transparent, with inherent redundancy and cryptographic security by design. The core value that it provides is transparency and immutability, from which trust is derived. Now if we make the blockchain mutable, as I see it, it breaks the trust value, making it ""another thing"". That does not convert it into a Database, at least in the traditional sense, since it still lacks the essential properties of requiring permissions and admin, being generally centralized, speed per physical TX, and so forth.A mutable Blockchain seems to be in no mans land, closer to Blockchain by design, but lacking to meet the core values that one expects on a Blockchain.

### Reply 2:
The main feature of blockchain is that blocks are linked together via hashing and pointing to the previous block. Blockchain is definitely a data structure, it even has some similarities to a linked list, but calling it a database is a question of semantics. For example, Bitcoin uses Google's LevelDB internally, so you could argue that blockchain is not a self-sufficient database software akin to MySQL.

Topic: Why most people believe bitcoin to be worthless?
### Original post:
most people think that ""No useful Dapp or any sort of business based on bitcoin or crypto in general that is making a decent amount of revenue except for exchanges and mining hardware companies.!""If you have to debate with someone about the ""real"" value of bitcoin. rather than people buying it to sell it for more fiat , what are the proper arguments that you have to use ?people have already built this kind of immune system against the benefits of Decentralization which is bitcoin strongest weapon.i mean the average person does not really care about centralization, more than 90% of the world's population, go to work early morning, go home in the evening, get paid by the end of the month and really do not give a fudge whether their money is sitting at the bank or an Exodus wallet as long as they get to spend it.that average person would buy into a new idea if it has something of a direct change on his life style, i mean if you were to invent a cheap flying car then the whole world would want to have it.I was trying to promote bitcoin to one of my friends, and he did not seem to be impressed at all, a while later another friend of ours talked about this new product that you can apply <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Yes, Bitcoin might be dropping its current price but is normal in a crypto, but I do not believe Bitcoin is useless, he's still the king and will remain the number one.

### Reply 2:
i don't know why you think people think like that! they really don't.there are two groups of people in my opinion.1. those who don't know about bitcoin or don't understand it. these people don't have any opinion about bitcoins ""worth"". they either don't care or they are always surprised and find the price weird. they don't say things such as ""bitcoin is worthless""!!!2. those who know about bitcoin and understand the potential of it.these people are the ones buying bitcoin. but some of them who want to buy it cheaper always spread FUD about how it is ""worthless"" because they want others to not-buy while they buy cheaper bitcoins.

Topic: Indian banks embraces blockchain
### Original post:
The popular Indian bank State Bank of India(SBI) is embracing the use of blockchain for it's smart contracts related to KYC.This is surely a positive move towards cryptocurrency for India since using the blockchain would need a cryptocurrency.This move will then be followed by 27 other banks which will create a positive impact in Crypto community. Although this is a good news India don't trust on Bitcoin as it is not much secure and stable as said by them and hence they will be creating their own coin for doing the transactions.

### Reply 1:
We hope that this will bring them closer to understanding that bitcoin is safe and a very good thing. But knowing what poverty level there is, at most 20% of the population will be engaged in bitcoins and it is still unclear.

### Reply 2:
this will be another private ledger for the banks to do their own business, and it has nothing to do with bitcoin or cryptocurrencies in general they are just using the same technology and the end user will probably never even finds out about it.for example when you have a bank account or a credit card and use it, you don't care if it is the traditional way of communication or are they using advanced cryptographic method and have a blockchain somewhere!

Topic: The ""Satoshi Risk""
### Original post:
Firstly, this is not an attack on Bitcoin. I am a huge Bitcoin advocate but i can't seem to get the thought of Satoshi's 1 million Bitcoins (worth $2.5b) out of my head.Now, we all know Satoshi has this huge stash of Bitcoins and we also know Bitcoin's overall valuation reacts to anything and everything. So im asking...What on Earth would happen if the ""great one"" was to suddenly move these coins ? Or what if he/she/they came out of the woodworks and came back to Bitcoin? From what i have researched, Satoshi is a revered entity and almost ""God like"" in the Bitcoin community. Are we immune from (what i like to call) the ""Satoshi risk"".P.S. I also think the ""Satoshi risk"" is one of the main reasons why the Bitcoin ETF was rejected. P.S.S. Satoshi, if you are reading this, please come back and express your views on how this scaling issue should be addressed (although i don't think your input alone should be the deciding factor considering we have to protect the <truncated> aspects of your great invention)

Topic: Bitcoin needs to be easier
### Original post:
Since the last waves bitcoin attracted more and more medium- and low-tech users. I find it crucial, bitcoin becomes a very easy to use currency, else I predict it will stay in a niche. There are two major points, that frighten low-tech-users:1. downloading blockchain and ""ripening of transactions"". which appear like high entry-costs for first-timers. 2. fear to loose the wallet and the need for thoughtful (!) backup methodsThe first one might be improved by good and extremly (!) simple and bold printed FAQ. In addition, the GUI should look more solid.The second one is more difficult. Maybe there should be some backup options in the client like ""Email me encrypted wallet"" and ""upload to Dropbox account with user xy and pass"".Actually - for the masses and little btc amounts - I would suggest something like mybitcoin.com (Paypal-style), where a small amout of bitcoins is stored at a third party and everything ist highly usable for everyday life (it somehow solves 2. and 1.). This might also simplify transactions via Android and provides a save-feel about the coins being backuped by some serious infratructure. Your account can be accessed from everywhere etc. Of course this is not bitc<rest of post truncated>

More precisely:Which websites do exist, that compete with mybitcoin.com?I would like to have a usable webinterface within a trustworthy third party. Furthermore I would like to tell all my peers about such website. I can't believe there is no such thing.

Topic: what if bitcoin becomes inferior
### Original post:
I looked for traces of Satoshi on the Internet. I've read all of his posts since 2009. He is sublime. If you read his writing, you can feel his passion. I have a little bit of bitcoin. I'm pretty relieved just to have Bitcoin. But if you look back at history.. Yahoo lost to Google. Yahoo was great, but Google was even better. Satoshi gave us a gift called Bitcoin without any greed and went somewhere. The problem is, new geniuses are born all the time, and technology advances. Bitcoin is not physics. It's blockchain technology. Which means that bitcoin is not an immutable law. A better technology than Bitcoin could emerge. What should we do if someone gives us a better system than bitcoin as a gift and leaves? It performs better than Bitcoin, and it even has the perfect decentralization of Bitcoin, which we value highly. Bitcoin was created in 2009, and now it's 2023. Cars made in 2009 cannot be better than cars made in 2023 or later. What if someone with as much genius and passion as Satoshi is creating a system better than Bitcoin?

### Reply 1:
Technologies involve every time and new developments always come up from time to time, and if it is a good technical, then the world will welcome it and it is as a compliment to what we already have that be it so I don't see any threat to bitcoin if there be any feature successful development that plays the role as bitcoin since we already have some alternatives currencies already. Google did not replace Yahoo but then both are playing there vital unique roles, it all depends on how you the user take them at per time and how you chose to use them and when to also use them.

### Reply 2:
Bitcoin has a network effect which the other coins will never achieve to get. In the early years of crypto, it was easier to create a natural coin distribution via mining but now it is impossible because everybody knows about crypto. Big miners will capitalize the new projects leave nothing to the average people. Bitcoin is unique that way because when bitcoin came to surface, most people couldn't understand what it is about. Some people sold their stash as soon as they they doubled their money. No other coin will have the same natural history like bitcoin. Also remember, bitcoin is a software. It gets updates every once in a while so when a new idea appears, btc will use it as well. No need to worry about it.

### Reply 1:
You can't sue Core developers who have no control over what the Bitcoin community chooses to use as a new client to cause a PoW change, in the event of an attack from miners on a minority chain. If anything, the purposeful attack on the minority chain could be argued to be a form of tortious interference for the exchanges and users who choose to still conduct business on it. So, the only true legal liability here is against mining businesses who choose to participate in a chain attack.If the miners choose to split off onto their own chain, and then choose to attack the minority chain, that would be seen as very malicious action by the Court systems. There is no legal justification or obligation to destroy the old chain. The Court will determine this to be a form of financial theft. If theminers let the minority chain die on its own, there is to problem.If the threat of action was good legal theory, exchanges, miners, and users could sue the BU Developers and other proponents for the same type of argument, if their hardfork proposal was successful. The legal argument is not isolated to a strict PoW change. The legal aspect would fall under ""any fundamental change"" and whether you ca<rest of post truncated>

That suit will fail you can't sue a consensus change and or a development team for implementing a proposal that will be decided by the network.They will just need to create new scripts it's Bitfury's fault for betting the farm on a non-determined outcome.First movers have an advantage and also a loss if it does not come to be.Either way our ciphers will need to change eventually Sha256 may be secure now but cryptography is not eternally secure a change will need to be done by 2050 which is when it is predicted the script security could get broken into.

Topic: Why can't a private key be calculated from its address?
### Original post:
If computers can calculate an address from its private key, then why can't they do the reverse and calculate a private key from an address?

### Reply 1:
Not all calculations are reversible. Suppose private keys and address work like this: private keys are long numbers, and addresses are the sum of all digits. Obviously a simplification, but just as an example.So if you have private key = 134505719542, then you can easily calculate the address: <truncated> = 46.Now I have another address: 43. What's the private key?

### Reply 2:
Any number of which the digits' sum is 43?I don' think your example really explains why a btc private key (actually, as far as I know each address has something like 2^100 private keys), can't be calculated from the address.

### Original post:
Interesting article:I took liberties to correct the title, as they will be calling it ""Blockchain 2.0"" not ""Bitcoin 2.0"".<link> 2.0: Unleash The SidechainsPosted 4 hours ago by Jon Evans (@rezendi), <truncated> will create a fifth protocol layer powering the next generation of the Internet, says Naval Ravikant. Our 2014 fund will be built during the blockchain cycle, concurs Fred Wilson. And Andreessen Horowitz have very visibly doubled down on Bitcoin.Even if you dont believe in Bitcoin as a currency, and Ill grant theres plenty to be skeptical about, you should be thinking: huh, a lot of extremely smart and successful people think that its underlying technology is a pretty big deal. But as I wrote myself just a few weeks ago, theres a big difference between blockchain technology and Bitcoin itself, right?Maybe not.A brief technical refresher: blockchains are the <truncated> technology introduced to the world by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, wherein a peer-to-peer network is used to codify and cryptographically verify transactions, without any central authority. Whats more, transactions can be orchestrated by programmable contracts.Bitcoin is both the first and most successful <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Just answering based on the little I do know, and understand:I don't think its necessarily bad that someone improves Bitcoin in such a huge way, and gains a profit off that effort. If Ethereum had done an IPO when they said they were going to, they'd all be sitting on hundreds of millions of dollars.Profit doesn't automatically become evil just because it involves modifying the core code.Especially in the setting of a worldwide audience and full public disclosure ahead of time. The changes facilitate Bitcoins success too.I don't think its secrecy. Ethereum was ""mum"" before the Miami conference as well. There were no ill intentions. They just weren't ready to announce yet. These guys did a podcast and said the info is coming soon. Doesn't seem feasible to just assume something shady is going on.As a remittances tool you're right. Or a store of value. Or tax haven, etc. If you want it to do anything other than the basics, it needs enhancing. Not fixing. I absolutely can not see Bitcoin, in its current form, being robust enough in features to facilitate a world economy. That's exactly why Bitcoin 2.0 innovation began so quickly. Are you an opponent of all the Bitcoin 2.0 efforts then?<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 2:
Ok, what am I missing here? I read that article earlier today and mostly just took away the notion that more people are (correctly, imo) viewing bitcoin as a credibly scarce, secure, asset which is therefore suited to serve as ""backing"" for other theoretical assets.But it sounds like I'm missing some contentious proposals for altering bitcoin itself in a non-trivial way. Anyone wanna save me a little time by providing links to relevant docs/threads?

Hi,In order for bitcoin to ever (truly) be able buy a coffee, sandwich, magazine, <truncated> speeds of bitcoin payments at the counter must be instant.This needs to happen or bitcoin will never be wildly used and accepted.Apple will likely be coming up with ""apple dollars"" sometime soon, so peoplecan pay for their Starbucks coffee, and offcousre it will be arranged in such a waythat you can leave with your coffee (or whatever) instantly...So in order for bitcoin to truly survive, faster transactions a needed... or a workaroundmethod like a escrow is needed. (<link> such an escrow for bitcion would also need to work on an iPhone.. so it can be widely adapted Witch is tricky as apple would never allow such an ""escrow app"" in its store. So would this still be possible to work on an iPhone, via html5 or something ( so apple an't block it ) ?If not, I fear ""apple dollares"" or something else might overpower bitcoins at one point in the future...( yes I am sure you can buy groceries / coffee with bitcoins at lots of places right now,but companies do this mostly for publicity,for it to ever be usable in the real world by everybody there need to be some changes!! )

sorry my post wasn't finished, accidentally posted to soonfor bitcoin to be working in the real world ( at the counter, where there are lines)10 minutes is way to longand likely apple will be coming up with a way to pay with you iPhone instantly beforethere will be a solution for bitcoin... this is concerningEven more concerning, apple would try its best for a bitcoin solution not to work onany of their devices...

No one has to wait 10mins for a coffee when they pay with btc.This non-problem has been discussed hundreds of times already. No double spend has ever occurred in a coffee (or sandwich) shop. Ever.

Topic: How Can We Make Sure Bitcoin Never Ends?
### Original post:
Some people like the Brazil Central Bank Chief called Bitcoin a Bubble & Pyramid Scheme, how can the bitcoin industry prove this wrong and make sure bitcoin never ends but grows bigger?

### Reply 1:
Use Bitcoin whenever and wherever possible. Buy gift cards for retailers and restaurants you frequently visit anyway with Bitcoin. (I like Egifter, but there's several sites where you can buy electronic gift cards for Bitcoin.) Buy something you've been wanting or dump some old stuff you don't want anymore for Bitcoin on Bitify. Try freelancing for Bitcoin on sites like XBTFreelancer. Because if cryptocurrencies become important enough to the global economy because people really do use this stuff every day, then Bitcoin is unlikely to die anytime soon.

### Reply 2:
The big proof we can give to those who don't believe in bitcoin survival and those saying bitcoin's going to die is showing them BTC price chart and explain them how crypto market developed since its creation till now.its production will surely ran out (cuz the supply is limited) but this doesn't mean- at all- that the whole currency will die

Topic: Why did you buy bitcoin today?
### Original post:
Since everyone on this forum is apparently a financial guru and so sure of the success of bitcoin...Why did you buy bitcoin today, or any time over the last week?State why you bought, the amount, and the reason.I'll guess the answer you guys are going to give: I bought 0.001 btc because I pretend to be a bitcoin professional and price is going to be 10 k by june!I purchased btc because the price has to go up, and your stuck in denial land. Its a fun place, bitcoins lead you on extorting you out of money all night, only to promise more after the next expensive date I'm waiting for the price to go down more to purchase, because the price will go up at certain buy walls and i'll make money.I'm waiting for the price to go down and then the long hold.If your one of these guys who is so sure of the value of btcoin, you'd have bought btc and then purchased an item with it in the last week, unless you live in the forest and go a week without spending money.

### Reply 1:
I bought this morning at $450 because every time it drops and I do not buy in I regret it later.

### Reply 2:
Same reason I bought Apple years ago when everything was tanking. Researched reasons then bought. Believe in it long term. Don't need the cash right now. Other uses beside as currency, the blockchain that is. Measured buys with every drop. Not putting ""life changing"" amounts in though because this is speculation. It could all end... But I doubt it. This is China getting out. We still have Silk Road coins to absorb someday too don't forget.

Bitcoins: Currency of the GeeksThe untraceable new virtual currency is exploding in usage, notoriety, and valueBy Barrett SheridanBW MAGAZINE<link>

### Reply 1:
Last sentence made me lol because its true.

### Reply 2:
That's me, and that's my miner in the article. Thanks Barrett!This article alone does a huge service to Bitcoin's legitimacy. Folks, Bloomberg just used the word ""currency"" to describe our bitcoins, and the article also seems to describe it as a legitimate sort of investment. It also indirectly serves to legitimize the practice of regular businesses accepting Bitcoins, because if it's legit enough for Bloomberg to share excitement over it, it must not be a crime.I was considering what people would think when they saw ""We Accept Bitcoin"" on my time and attendance payment slips (enclosed in invoices) after hearing Senators drone on about how it's drugs and money laundering. After seeing this article, I have no doubt it's staying on my payment slips.Imagine trying to pay for a haircut with BitBills to someone who never heard of this. Then imagine the same person thumbing through something from Bloomberg describing Bitcoins as being for-real, and then you ask again, if they accept bitbills. The implications are huge.This article occupied front and center on the Businessweek.com homepage all morning - I'll wet my pants if the print magazine comes out with a big fat B on the front cover.<rest of post truncated>

I like to post my CoinTelegraph articles on here, becasue I think it ellicits more thoughtful comments, so- here's the latest one:Regulation is a game of cat and mouse. In the age of high-frequency trading, the time honored equilibrium in the feedback loop of pursuit, capture and escape is becoming increasingly distorted.Long and arduous is the process by which financial regulation is conceived and implemented, taking on the order of months to fully realize.This is a classical procedure which traces its roots back to an age where commodities crossed the Atlantic on schooners and the code of conduct was scrawled out longhand with quill pens. In those days of yore, if legislation contained a failure or loophole it could be exploited only so many times before it was possible to stem the breach.Our digital age is described by, among other things, adaptive machine learning processes that are capable of executing transactions in fractions of a second. As such, while the time horizon during which legislative oversights might remain vulnerable has generally remained constant, our ability to exploit them has increased by a degree previously unimaginable.

If you wrote that, you're far too intelligent to be posting on this forum. 95+% of the people reading the posts here are barely literate signature campaigners looking to grub a few bitpennys from posting on topic drivel. They have no concept of what money is, no understanding of basic economics, can't learn from history, don't understand the basics of coding and think basic addition is high math.

### Reply 2:
Jeez. The idea scares the crap out of me.We all know regulations are too high in number, too broad in coverage, and too high in penalty. All because they are kinda hard to actually enforce, so the idea is to average things out and provide an appropriate penalty in an appropriate number of cases in an appropriately public way to act as a deterrent.When the regulations actually become easy (quick, cheap) to enforce, I highly doubt that excess ones will be removed, that coverage will narrow, or that penalties will reduce appropriately.

Topic: Continues integration used for mining
### Original post:
Some of you may be aware of ""continues integration"" approach in software development. One of tool used for that could be - for example - GitHub Actions. Server takes software code and launches build, tests etc, to see if new development did not break anything. That's theory. What if someone would add ""one more extra task"" to be performed on the server side?The Sysdig Threat Research Team (Sysdig TRT) recently uncovered an extensive and sophisticated active cryptomining operation and called that PURPLEURCHIN - more details there: <link>

### Reply 1:
That's quite interesting and as long as none of the service providers offers free resources, that threat can't survive for a long time... The same blog post also mentioned the possibility of a 51% attack on Bitcoin and even if they remain undetected for some time, I wouldn't be worried.

### Reply 2:
Interesting and a bit more sophisticated then some other ways people have hijacked things for mining but ultimately you really have to wonder if the time and effort they are putting into this will came back to haunt them due to the size. This will force the authorities to get involved and so on. As has been shown sooner or later large bot-nets are more likely going to get taken down hard and the operators found then smaller ones. Since they are also concentrating on big providers, they are more likely to have a good working relationship with the feds...-Dave

### Original post:
Finextra Future Money provokes strong views on fintech innovationEdit - forgot the link: <link> is good, Pingit is rubbish and Swift will be dead within three years. There was no shortage of controversial and provocative views at a lively Finextra Future Money conference this week at Canary Wharf's Level39.More than 400 people from the fintech world signed up for the conference and the vast majority battled tube strikes, fog and even a bomb scare to get to One Canada Square to explore the new wave of innovation sweeping across the financial services sector. Alessandro Hatami, digital payments and innovations director at Lloyds Banking Group kicked things off. He used his keynote to unleash an impressive battery of stats, revealing that, just three years after the bank launched an app, 30% of logins are now mobile.In a wide-ranging talk, Hatami gave enthusiastic backing to the use of big data, cautious support to crypto-currencies and mobile NFC payments and, perhaps most surprisingly, a warm welcome to fraud...albeit only as a tool for forcing bankers to innovate. Fintech may have captured the zeitgeist but, if the Future Money audience is any guide, it is still a niche area with h<rest of post truncated>

Fidor uses ripple?i think some context.. fidor used ripple to test the possibilities, involving 3 test transactions.. fidor does not use ripple for regular transaction's as ripple is still not fully compliant or bug free. secondly ripple is not a replacement of bank transfers, due to the fact that for instance:john in Germany wants to change his euros into dollars so he can move it to Alice in USA. john finds jane to swap Euro's for dollars.Alice receives dollars.now thats the inner workings of ripple stage one.but now John has to a Euro debtand Alice has to cash out ACTUAL dollars into a bank account.so the banking world would show that jane transfers actual dollars into alices bank account.and then janes customers who want euros would receive them from johns bank account until johns ripple debt is zero'dall ripple does is avoid exchange rates and fee's. put simply WIRE TRANSFERS STILL OCCUR and in the case of Fidor bank, it just means that fidor does not have to themselves change euros into dollars. they simply pay euros to other euro accounts from (janes customer base)They are a bank not a customer thus ripple wont provide the secret banking friendships they have with other bank<rest of post truncated>

you will find the research by googling ""fidor payward kraken"" that way you can find the info yourself instead of disbelieving the info im spoon feeding.but anyway to keep it in contextpayward (ripple) CUSTOMERS use krakens bank account (john) to withdraw funds to euro bank accounts. and payward (ripple) CUSTOMERS use krakens bank account (john) to deposit euro funds to credit their ripple balance.fidor still does the wire transfer between krakens bank account and customers personal euro bank <truncated> ripple and bitcoin move to a ""cash in hand only"" process via local meetups and ATM's, bank accounts and wire transfers will still occur

Topic: Message to all people who panic when crypto price goes down!
### Original post:
Why do you panic? Why?IF YOU DO NOT SELL, YOU DO NOT LOSE ANYTHING! YOU LOSE THE MOMENT YOU SELL, after you purchased high and buy low. It does not matter what is the price ATM, the only thing which matters is what is the price when you decide to sell. So, to shield yourself from losing money, DONT sell under the price you bought it. If you trust in crypto and believe it ll bounce back, WHAT THE FUCK IS THE PROBLEM AND WHY PANIC?If you do not trust in crypto and you have doubts whether it ll bounce back, well, in that case you are in the wrong industry and you shouldn't have invested in crypto in the first place. So knowing this, what is the problem again?EDIT: This post was created on February 6, 2018 when BTC price reached $5920. After a few days, it recovered to $8k. Will keep this ledger so people know Bitcoin ALWAYS recovers!

### Reply 1:
nice said, It is a bit wrong, but yeah, if you do not trust crypto - what are you doing here!?!?But about the investing and not losing until you sell... - you are wrong.You will lose even more if you do not sell and it crashes to 0...The question is why you got in when it was that high and if you did and now you panic, you deserve to lose your money, as you have trowed them away the moment you buy something you have no idea what it is and what is happening with it...In other news: the price will be going down for few months to come, at least, so maybe it is a good idea to think how you can benefit from all this movement.But again be careful and DO YOUR HOMEWORK!!NEVER INVEST MORE THEN YOU CAN LOSE!!!Never invest in something you do not understand...and so on Good luck and happy to see my expectation of downtrend in jan 2018 was correct...Let's see if / when it will hit my target for bottom...

### Reply 2:
I totally agree with you but I also believe the current price plunge is not only caused by 'non-believers in Crypto' that happened to get in but also by many believers who 'maybe' changed their mind or decided to take some rest from all the hassle and uncertainly out there

Topic: Bitcoin appears on Excel, Microsoft implicitly admits Bitcoin is currency?
### Original post:
Bitcoin finally set foot on the mainstream, in the form of a currency option in Microsoft Excel. There are a number of barriers one has to overcome to become a real trend. And Bitcoin has overcome this challenge during the past 10 years. Finally, Microsoft added this crypto currency to its system, in the form of a currency option in Excel office software.Microsoft has long placed great emphasis on the pre-coding market. The world's leading software group has announced it will implement an ambitious strategy, directly cooperating with prominent Blockchain projects such as Ethereum, R3, AntShares, ...What do you think? We discuss this together

### Reply 1:
It could have be nice if there's a link to that information for verification. That apart, this is what we are waiting for, that big companies like Microsoft, FaceBook, Google and Amazon should embrace the reality on ground under the cover of cryptocurrency. They admitting that Bitcoin is a currency will make things work easily very soon for Bitcoin.

### Reply 2:
That is indeed a great News. News related to Bitcoin adoption always bring cheers to the market. I did read this article four days back. The link to the article - <link> is a new addition to the currency symbol in excel. Now the path for Bitcoin to go mainstream has opened and already started, as Excel is one of the most used Software from Microsoft's office edition. Good news for traders, it will easy to maintain records now. I wonder when will Google add Bitcoin to Google sheets?

Topic: My little research.
### Original post:
I haven't been here for long but I have taken my time to read through some of the important conceptions about Bitcoin, and with my little knowledge, I really know that Bitcoin is a good means of investment if I can hold it from now till dear life.I have done a little research about Bitcoin and why some governments refuse to accept Bitcoin in their own country even when they know that they are in power to make the most important citizens in their country access it and take advantage of it, and it wonders me a little.However, Bitcoin is a risky means of investment and it is not something that investors should be in a rush to sell. I am just saying this out of my own ideas based on my slight research.I have a little business that I am doing so far, and I would like to accept Bitcoin in my business, but I don't have enough ideas about Bitcoin. That's why I want to learn more, but truth be told, it's good to practice while learning.While learning about Bitcoin, I will have to practice it little by little with the little money that I can afford.

### Reply 1:
Do you mean that you want to make a breakthrough in business, for example accepting BTC as payment in your business?If that is the purpose of your discussion, perhaps you need to study more deeply and consider your decision properly. This may be detrimental to you if you receive payments in the form of BTC. BTC is very volatile, maybe you need help from a third party as a service that converts BTC to USD.However, if you really intend to accept BTC in full as an investment goal, that's no problem, the decision is all in your hands. Bitcoin is indeed feasible if used as a long-term investment. Even though the price falls, Bitcoin is also able to rise again and sometimes exceeds the initial price we bought BTC.

Topic: Ashley Madison, Bitcoin and Blackmail
### Original post:
Dear all, A while back, my work email address was used with a whole load of others from my workplace to set up fake accounts on Ashley Madison, which were then dumped in the recent, infamous hack of that site.I'd checked my address on I've Been Pwned after a friend advised me to when the scandal broke and found my email on it; I told my IT section at work and my boss, reported it to the police, etc.I then received a blackmail email some time later (as you'd kind of expect) demanding I pay Bitcoins into a Bitcoin account. I've again reported this to the cybercrime lot of the local Police, my IT department etc but the use of a bitcoin account intrigued me.I've read a bit about bitcoin and have a vague idea how it works but really I'm a complete ignoramus; I thought it might be interesting to post on this forum with the bitcoin number the blackmailer sent me - <truncated> and see if it's possible to track down who this might belong to.I realize this might be a silly question but I do love looking into things, so please forgive me naivety if this sounds stupid to you...Any info advice gratefully received!Thanks!

### Reply 1:
It is very unlikely that you will be able to trace anything through that number as they probably generate a new number for every mail they send. Unless they then send it to a very obvious collection address, which I doubt, you won't be able to track it if they use a mixer for instance.

This is a saying we all know "" Everything that has an advantage also has a disadvantage ""I brought up this topic so we all can discuss on the disadvantage part of BitcoinAlthough this topic was already here about 4 years ago but it was about advantages and disadvantages of investing in Bitcoin<link> nobody seems to really talk about the disadvantagesDo we know that the anonymity of bitcoin is a problem?Let's all think about thisSome of us here do day to day transactions and we know that our identities are not known, and since our identities are not know some use that as an opportunity to purchase illegal stuffs and and do illegal things because we are safe with the knowledge ""The don't know our identity"" We can look into this article for more explanations <link>

### Reply 1:
Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general?For bitcoin, one of the biggest weakness is that its scalability. When it first came out, it takes a mere split second to make a transaction. Right now, it takes hours for the same task. As more people make bitcoin transactions on the network this wait time is only going to increase.There is a team right now trying to speed things up by developing a Lightning Network. However, this is currently still in the works and while its technically usable right now, you might actually lose your bitcoin if not done properly.

### Reply 2:
Fun fact: Bitcoin isn't even anonymous, only pseudo-anonymous. There's a significant difference.And the good ol' ""buying illegal stuff"" part. Bitcoin is money, and money is a tool. People will always use whatever tool or technology for nefarious stuff.e.g.Hammers and crowbars for killing peopleCars and motorcycles to be used as getaway vehiclesSocial media to stalk peopleThe internet in general to steal money and identitiesThe U.S. Dollar to buy illegal drugs and to pay for hitmenand the list goes on and on and on..

market has grown constantly in the last years and this is just a sort of ""natural evolution"" .it's just matter of size since nowadays these big players are investing in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies too.the same since the market is big enough, it's very hard make a massive dump since other investors will buy immediately your coins.

Topic: Bitcoin holder's dilemma
### Original post:
Hey guys, I've decided to ask you - what whould you do in this problemmatic situation?Suppose you have some bitcoins (let's say 22) and you bought them / got them a few years ago very cheap, and now you see it's price and.... what to do?!! Will you take the profit and go away, or sit and hold further? Suppose you're not going to buy more. But when to sell?

### Reply 1:
Honestly, if you bought bitcoins years ago, selling now and even months before would be very reasonable. In a sense, the fruit.is already ripe and it's good to be picked. But if you're too greedy, I'm sure you'll always regret selling those coins(whenever that is) ones you see bitcoin increases again from that point. Worse thing is you might not even be able to sell it because of that mentality.

### Reply 2:
Money will never be earned.If I bought 22 bitcoin years ago, I will sell without hesitation.Allow me to use this part of the money to buy other altcoin, and then come up with some to buy a few mine machine for myself.

We can just use blockchain state:Now in BitcoinADDR1 PRIVATE_KEY1 2 BTC TRANSACTIONS 1. 0.4 BTC, 2. 0.4 BTC, 3. 0.4 BTC, 4. 0.4 BTC, 5. 0.4 BTCADDR2 PRIVATE_KEY2 5 BTC TRANSACTIONS 1. 1 BTC, 2. 4 BTCSending to ADDR3 2 BTC from two <truncated> #1, #2, #3 (1.2 BTC) PRIVATE_KEY1ADDR2 #1 (1 BTC) <truncated> 2 BTCADDR1 0.2 BTC (return)How could it beADDR1 PRIVATE_KEY1 STATE 2 BTCADDR2 PRIVATE_KEY2 STATE 5 BTCSending to ADDR3 2 BTC from two <truncated> 1 BTC PRIVATE_KEY1ADDR2 1 BTC <truncated> 2 BTCADDR1 0.2 BTC (return)CHANGING STATE TO:ADDR1 1 BTCADDR2 4 BTCWhat do you think?

### Reply 1:
Your solution is vulnerable to replay attacks.

### Reply 2:
But your solution doesn't have inputs. Therefore there is no indication in the transaction WHICH coins are being spent. It just says to send some coins from an address to another address. It doesn't way anything about which ones:You show ""Payments"" of:ADDR1 1 BTCADDR2 1 BTCLater, that same transaction can be sent again, and it will spend DIFFERENT coins taking 1 BTC from ADDR1 AGAIN, and 1 BTC from ADDR2 AGAIN.

Topic: New Stimulus Bill Rejected- Good News For Bitcoin..
### Original post:
The United States Senate just rejected the most recent stimulus proposal which did not have any plans to include another $1,200 dollar check to individual citizens. I didn't really think much about the correlation between the stimulus checks and the price of bitcoin going up until I read this article by cointelegraph. <link> the bill was rejected in what looks like could be in large part because it did not include another round of $1200 checks, means it's very possible it will be included in the next proposed bill, and therefore another chance for a boost in the arm to bitcoin as it's likely much of these checks will go to buying bitcoin again as they did before.There is even proof behind this correlation, as pointed out by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong ( I've decided to post this despite that fact that I think Brian is a sleazy scumbag who engages in illegal activities in order to make himself and his company wealthy in terms of freezing his exchange and using it to his advantage when there was very little to no oversight of his company).

### Reply 1:
Can anyone explain why the $1,200 check wasn't included and what are the chances that it will be included in the next proposal? Will they be printing more fiat to distribute another round of $1,200s? If so, it's like saying the market needs more fiat to pump bitcoin.

### Reply 2:
It's going to be a disaster really in a matter of months or years at last. And if that isn't bad enough, the entire world's economy will be affected by it. On the other hand, I guess it's great that at least we're some of the few who've locked in a quite safe position.. safer than fiat anyway, considering all the events.

What wallet are you using? is it Segwitx2 addapted? or you are just using an online wallet like Xapo or <truncated> you should try to ask for an acceleration on your transaction, it can be easy for you since most of the times you are not going to be asked to pay if your transaction doesnt have zero fees.And please, for the next time, try to put more fees in there, you can have that transaction stucked for more than days if you choose to have those kind of fees.

Bitcoin is not banking so btc will not miss, but its usd price of course could. Now you can wait a bit more or try to use services that can faster your transaction (google it, there are a few of them). And every time you want to make a transaction dont forget to chack btc transaction pool to know how long the line is. Good luck

It is a journey between rural-unbanked Kenya to Nairobis technological start-up hub. This was a lived experience, an invaluable addition to my research about global finance on a specific, local level.""<link>

Appreciate the link, was interesting to watch. Only 11% of Africa has access to the internet. Kenya is trying to be the IT hub in Africa, competing against Nigeria and South Africa.<link> Kenya, has now matured into a globally-recognized hub for technology and innovation. Boosted by government support, interested investors, and low barriers to entry, young tech-savvy Kenyans have led the way for this evolution; taking risks, launching new products for the local market [e.g. M-Farm and iCow], while creating a pan-African presence with brands like Cellulant. This innovative energy that stemmed from Silicon Savannah, as Nairobi is known, captured the attention of governments, aid agencies, venture capitalists and Silicon Valley giants. Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt predicted that Nairobi could become the African tech leader. Google and other tech giants such as Cisco Systems, Intel, Nokia and Microsoft, have proven this faith by founding hubs and expanding their business operations in the city. The IBM lab, although Africa-focused, was built in Nairobi and its partnership with the Kenyan government is seen as a clear vote of confidence in the countrys ICT sector.""Seeing as I <rest of post truncated>

Topic: 41% of people globally say they trust Bitcoin over local currencies
### Original post:
Premise (a crowdsourced insights company) reported in a press release that 41% of respondents consider Bitcoin to be more reliable than their own local currencies. Principally due to the decentralized aspect of the blockchain tech. Wow! Are people realizing what decentralization is about and the garbage behind central banks and co? If that's the case, I'm quite surprised seeing all the low information voters.The survey has interviewed 11 000 participants and is not closed yet. It started 2-3 months ago26% of respondents said they would rather use Bitcoin than their local currency.<link>

### Reply 1:
Yes, As far I know near around 100 million people around the world are known about cryptocurrency properly. Regular Crypto users are far less than that number. Till now more than 25% of American citizens don't know what is cryptocurrency and how to use it!!So, Such a huge(41%) respondent is really great, that means most of the people didn't use cryptocurrency but they hear about it and know the functionalities of blockchain technology that's why they support Bitcoin over their local currencies. I believe that by 2025 there will be a revolution in the use of currency in the world and Bitcoin will be more developed and adopted by govt phase.

### Reply 2:
Regardless of the source of the numbers mentioned here in the picture, I'm not sure about these numbers because these numbers seem way higher than reality to me, still, there are many people who don't even know about bitcoin even in America if the situation is like that in a country like America then there is even worst situation in the other countries and other are still many people they don't know bitcoin or they partly know about bitcoin as a currency, then how can we ask them if they really trust something they don't even understand completely.

Topic: What is Bitcoin really?
### Original post:
With so many forum members concentrating on alt coins and ""how to get rich quick"" I thought I'd just post the main reason why I think Bitcoin is so important and why I was so interested in it (and still am).The amazing invention is actually not being a digital currency or a payment system but in being a ""non-trust"" reliant public DB (subject to a >50% control).Before Bitcoin such a thing never existed (that I am aware of) and the ramifications of this invention will far outweigh the silly arguments about what a Bitcoin should be worth or whether it needs to be subject to whatever laws.We are already seeing exciting new projects that are based upon the underlying blockchain and I expect we'll be seeing a lot more to come.For the *real* believers I think that the ""blockchain"" is what we have most to thank Satoshi for!

### Reply 1:
I would really like to see the Certificate Authority system invoked in a distributed, p2p consensus style system. It has the potential to be more trustworthy, and also to present a lower entry barrier to smaller/newer web based organisations that cannot currently afford to pay subscriptions to the incumbent CA's. Reading about all the various methods that can be used to inject malicious code into website content of late, it would be very beneficial for all site operators to be able to give the end user some guarantee that they're browsing using the code that the site's devs actually wrote.

### Reply 2:
Yes, agreed. An authoritative distributed record system not controlled by any single entity is a first in human history. Money is simply the first application (and a great way to trigger recognition and adoption for the whole concept). It enables decentralization of things that, for thousands of years prior, required an authoritative entity. It'll be very interesting to see how blockchain-style consensus systems are ultimately used.

Edit: I'm NOT arguing in favour of a fork. Just clarifying some facts that have been misrepresented recently.There seems to be a little misconception floating around concerning the miners and their power in the network.""Miners are too heavily invested in SHA256 and won't allow any proof-of-work changes.""This is wrong.But first, let's see how the miners can veto pretty much everything in the network.The network assumes a transaction is valid and secure once it has been approved by a (or multiple) miner.Suppose Bob sends Alice 10 BTC. The miner receives this transaction, along with countless orders, and decides whether or not he will include it in the block he is currently making (by doing the proof-of-work).This is how he can veto pretty much everything: he can choose to ignore some transactions for any reason.

You can't just change ""Bitcoin"" because you can't stop the old/existing fork from running. All you can do is fork the network. Once again because this seems to be a reality that is <truncated> is by consensus the protocol as it exists today. You can fork that protocol but you can't force a change to that protocol. That greatly limits the types of changes which will be accepted. Many people (myself included) never want to see a permanent split for any reason unless absolutely unavoidable. So if you (or the GPU miner's alliance) propose a fork (and yes ANY breaking change is a fork) that switches the hashing algorithm I (and many others) won't support it. A permanent fork would be massively disruptive, would destroy value, and would split the resources of the community. I would only change sides if I felt doing so would help to kill off one of the forks.BTW I no longer mine and probably never will so this isn't some personal view to protect my own profit margins. It is just that having two ""Bitcoins"" each calling themselves ""Bitcoin"" and supported by a large group of people would be a worst case scenario.

I don't think anyone wants a change from SHA256 to Scrypt except for people who stand to profit immensely from it. Unless there is a major security flaw found, there is simply no reason for such a disruptive shift. Such a shift could/would severely hamper Bitcoin growth, and I think would set us back several years.

GE is one of the participants in the series of fund raising for X age, a cyber-security start up. They saw big potential in block chain technology. They use the block chain technology to connect the industrial devices in IoT in a more secured manner. GEs R&D department is also using block chain technology to connect consumers with renewable energy producers.

It feels a bit gimmicky really, maybe the President is looting all the riches from the country while pretending that Bitcoin is somehow a savior. Apparently the current President is quite young and popular, but how many times have we seen those sort of people turn into dictators when enough power comes to their heads. Latching on to a cryptocurrency might produce a few short term favorable headlines, but it does very little to change the underlying poor economic state of the country. People need jobs before they can accrue enough money to save and they need things like stable internet access before they can reliably hold bitcoin, maybe the politicians should focus on these basics before trying to get all techy.

### Reply 2:
That's the same thing in my country during the news segment in a channel, they display the exchange rate of different currency and I don't think that we have to change anything about it because they will probably do the same thing with it.

Topic: Phising and scamming is getting out of hand
### Original post:
Its really sad the amount of people who are getting scammed out of their coins by criminals. For every ico there seems to be a phising website. I came across a crowd sale site the other day that looked convincing and I thought about contributing but because I am a website designer I could see something was not quite right. I checked the URL with one from a ico review site and could see it was a scam. I'm lucky because I have enough experience to spot it but newbies don't know about this and are getting screwed left right and centre. People are making fake nano ledger's and selling them on ebay, there's phising shape shift copies, emails trying to extract your mew key and dodgy bitcoin fork wallets stealing private keys. It's like the whole industry is under attack by some very clever people and I wonder can anything be done? Can phising websites be reported and taken down? The weird thing is that if the criminals just invested in crypto rather than stealing other peoples they would probably make as much money and not have to go through all that effort. Does anyone know if this a really big problem or is it a few isolated cases.

### Reply 1:
That is why you will find many threads in the forum, in the alternative clients section usually but even in some other parts of the forum where people ask where to buy the hardware wallet and the answer from all experienced members is : Never buy from another source (Ebay) but always buy from the official website.For Nano S the correct website is <link> Trezor the correct website is <link>

### Reply 2:
With the cryptocurrency industry booming its no surprise that criminals are also interested in getting there hands of this cryptocurrency especially Bitcoin. Even the early stage where only HYIPs are prominent to scamming new persons as it is easy to create fake companies with good designed sites. Now there are phishing sites and also the famouse WannaCry ransom where you need to pay Bitcoin in order to access your computer again. As a cryptocurrency owner we must also step up our security as it is our precious digital asset.

Topic: Mining, Pools, and voting on the future of bitcoin
### Original post:
The discussion in the mining forum and the upcoming transition to support p2sh is very interesting. As a miner, you have a vote on such changes to the bitcoin protocol. Your vote is proportional to the amount of mining capacity you control. The mining pools are being asking to voice which of the proposals for p2sh they support by stating their preference in the blocks the create. This got me thinkingas a pool operator, taking a position could be risky. Miners in your pool that don't agree with your position might leave for another pool that was inline with their position. So, one thing the pools could do is divide up their operations such that the miners could connect to one of several servers, each of which takes a different position on the issue at hand. This lets the individual miners register their votes however they wish and they don't have to jump to another pool. Good for the miners and good for the pool operator.In the future, I would love to see mining hardware sold as a little solid state brick device for less than $100. Just about everyone could run these miners to help secure the network and ensure they have a vote in its future direction. Pools could make it simple for<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
If you belong to a pool, the pool will be putting a vote into the blocks it finds (well, most pools will). You could think of the pool as being your representative for the purposes of voting on the protocol upgrade. If you mine solo, each block you find is effectively is a non vote and may hinder the rollout of either solution (because a super majority of mining capacity is needed before the change will go forward).

### Reply 2:
This is a huge issue right now. The first step is for everyone to stop using at least the top 3 biggest pools which are Deepbit, Slush and Guild. I know that not everyone will stop of course, but if enough of you do, we have at least limited the massive power they have over decisions right now.The other step is to simply raise awareness among miners and pool operators. Miners need to consult their pool operator to find out what he/she is voting for and then change pool if you dislike the pool operators opinion. Of course with p2pool anyone can vote for themselves but it's not necessary for everyone to use p2pool. It's VERY necessary however that we limit the power of the largest pools and start thinking about our votes.For example I have mined at Bitlc.net (former Bitcoins.lc) for a long time now but I have no clue what the pool operator is thinking in regards to P2SH. When the voting period is on I will certainly want to know if the pool has the same opinion as I do, if it doesn't I will change my pool.

Topic: Bitcoin and Regulations
### Original post:
We all want Bitcoin to one day be part of the mainstream but along the way it can mean compromises with the government that can be also concern that they can't control and manipulate the whole thing so they come up with regulations on its use and movement. There are , of course, many grounds why would the government want to put up regulations and some can be valid while others can be creepy (though of course they are not showing them). Now, am wondering, if we go for regulations...does it mean we are actually making the Bitcoin movement less potent and possibly compromise the very reasons why it is existing?

### Reply 1:
It's quite a dilemma. Government acceptance would mean we would be a step closer to mass adoption, but it would also mean there would be government regulations. Governments can't endorse a technology to its citizens and not be able to protect them from it, and they certainly won't allow that much money to flow without them getting a cut. On the other hand, operating from a legal gray area is enough to discourage majority of the population from getting into it. If we want Bitcoin to spread, then governments will get involved. It's an inevitability, and sadly, we don't have a say in it.As far as the reason for its existence goes, Satoshi described it as a ""system for electronic transactions without relying on trust."" That should hold even when under regulation. It's also worth mentioning that Bitcoin wasn't designed to be completely anonymous.

### Reply 2:
right. it is a dilemma. legalized or not. The challenge for policymakers, as it always does, is to develop efficient solutions without hindering the growth of newly emerging businesses and markets.

Topic: My wild weekend!
### Original post:
So I got the news BCH might be pumped on friday. I transferred .25 BTC into BCH(Got in at 799) and saw it rise steadily through the day. when it hit 1600 it started to explode saturday night. It just kept going and going. I was watching live bitcoin trading on youtube and the host couldn't keep up putting both moon goals and mars goals on the graph too late to match the climb. The moment it hit 2700 was the same moment the price shot down to 2100. when i say shot down I mean it was like someone fired a shotgun at the person holding the price. From there it fell then pumped twice and steadied into monday today which i think was the last major pump. We shall see. I'm prepared to take positions again for a $500 surge.in total I made $500. If my internet literally did not fail I would have sold around the $2000 mark, instead getting out at the 1500 mark the next morning. (Would have been 2500 to 3000 if I was able too) what an interesting day and a learning experience.Was anyone else able to ride the roller coaster?

It was originally posted here:<link> non-orphaning, merge-mined blockchains for rapid transaction confirmationThe proposal is to have parallel chains of mini-blocks (3 seconds) that begin at every new 'real block' (10 minutes), and rather than orphaning forks of these mini-block chains with lower difficulty, nodes save them along with the greatest difficulty chain.This parallel 'tree' or 'grove' of mini-block chains would be merge-mined with the main blockchain, to conserve hashing power, and would give a higher resolution picture of when a transaction was first propagated into the network.Upon the creation of a new 10-minute block, nodes would check if any of the transactions contained in it (in-block transactions) have a double spend in the parallel mini-block chains that has at least 10 more mini-blocks backing it than backing the in-block transaction. The mini-blocks counted toward this comparison can be in any of the chains, including in lower difficulty forks. If the block does contain such a transaction, then it is invalid and not accepted by other nodes. Under this rule, a transaction <rest of post truncated>

Topic: Will Bitcoin be replaced by another cryptocurrency?
### Original post:
Does it make sense to believe that Bitcoin could one day be replaced by another cryptocurrency, that is, a cryptocurrency that really does make Bitcoin obsolete?

### Reply 1:
Yes it could happen but i doubt very much it will happen the short to medium term, to actually make bitcoin obsolete would be a achievement.

### Reply 2:
Yes, this makes sense. Bitcoin is probably not suitable for replacing every and each fiat coin in the world right now as it is and make an unique, universal coin... So another coin will probably replace it, or Bitcoin will evolve so much that it will make no more sense to call it Bitcoin. Only future will tell.

Topic: What will happen to Bitcoin if China shuts all physical Internet cables.
### Original post:
Then there will be a big LAN in Asia without physical connections to the outside Internet, Resulting in another small Internet emerging.And we know there are large harshpowers in China.Then what will happen to Bitcoin?Will there be two Bitcoin systems co-existing?

### Reply 1:
bitcoin will have a much more smooth rise and a bigger one with no more big drops.because if your unlikely scenario happens, we will get rid of the biggest source of FUD which has always created a lot of chaos in the market. and on top of that people will finally realize that bitcoin is a decentralized currency and it won't matter when some government does weird stuff.

### Reply 2:
You don't understand anything about China and their ability to censor do you? Furthermore to eliminate 1.4 billion people from the crypto equation is not something that you or anyone else heavily invested would want. I GUARANTEE THAT.

You need a custom design for the website to make it look nicer w/ some more content. It seems like your just trying to advertise your youtube channel which makes it seem like a not very useful site to me.

Topic: The new BitID Authentication System
### Original post:
I just learned of this new login authentication service that uses your Bitcoin wallet to login to various places. Instead of ""Connect with Google"" or ""Connect with Facebook"" instead you can ""Connect with Bitcoin"". <link> gut reaction is that this is not a good idea. It creates another system that needs to access your private key. Why is that necessary when you aren't making a payment? For example, if I want to access my hotel room - instead of a key;swipe card;access code - BitID would allow you to use your bitcoin wallet. But this means the authentication mechanism needs to access my private key. Why do I want that happening when an access code or something would not put my wallet credentials at more risk?Thoughts?

Please learn before speaking: <link> I wish Google would add a hardware wallet into Nexus 5 (or some other smartphone company). Can you imagine if every smartphone could be also used as a hardware secured authentication device/Bitcoin wallet?

### Original post:
I wonder if there is anyone who has been immersed in cryptocurrencies for any length of time who IS NOT UTTERLY SURPRISED that one Bitcoin is now selling for around $7900, at current prices around 6.16 times one ounce of gold. You show me someone who genuinely predicted Bitcoin's meteoric rise, and I'll show you a boaster or a liar. Sure lots of people, Roger Ver, et cetera, predicted a rise. But not the magnitude, and I'm not talking about all those out declaring to-the-moon quotes to get a soundbyte and their name in the <truncated> I have been very surprised. But maybe if I was smarter, I would not have been. When Bitcoin first overtook gold in price, I was floored - whatttt? went my brain.

But others think there are 2.5 million tons of gold in the world, which would mean there are about 72 billion, 915 million ounces of gold.And so when I think of the supply of gold, which is universally considered a very rare and valuable item, should I have been surprised when B<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
yes, this is sheer insanity.i was surprised when pot (marijuana) overtook golds in price. infinitely less supply of gold, is also way more useful, but yet pot and gold sat staring at each other around 400 USD. which explains that immediate demand does funny things to a price. moreso, supply restriction as a function of time. but gold is real. not 1s and 0s. with utility across multiple spheres (art, science, medicine and many other fields). there is a reason gold is so coveted, it is both useful and rare. bitcoin has utility, but only really as a payment method, in its current iteration. this does not have to be the case, observe ETHcertainly! this is indeed the future, although I wonder how many of the coins currently available will survive given the difficulties in regulating the older/original cryptos. expect coins made by govs to replace fiats. observe the burgeoning ""crypto rubble"" and notice how they didnt choose an already in place coin which brings me to my point; despite the limited supply, I dont think the current price is one of its effects. its the restriction on supply; the demand for speculative purposes is outstriping what people are willing to part with right now. t<rest of post truncated>

That. What's the benefit of pegging your Lightning balance to USD? And how exactly is this supposed to work? Like, creating 1 L-USD for each 3,000 Lightning sats? Doesn't make any sense.

It sounds like USDT, but running on the Lightning Network. The ""tokens"" can be non-custodial, but the dollar peg can only be centralized.

Topic: How can the blockchain keep up with the growing number of bitcoin users?
### Original post:
I just made an estimate total of how much I have paid for transaction fees, exchange fees, conversion-to-cash fees etc., and I did not feel very good about these extra fees just for me to be able to spend my bitcoin.I am just curious if anybody here has any idea on how blockchain is planning to keep up with the fast growth of users. You see, my dream with bitcoin is that you can use it for everyday expenses like taxi fare, buying a movie ticket or any random stuff you encounter everyday just like our normal paper bills. But I think this will stay as a dream unless instant confirmations will be attainable.

### Reply 1:
The thing is that these fees are often changing, especially depending on how the transactions are doing based on confirms and whatnot. However, I see what you're saying. It's very odd to end up paying a percentage when you're just trying to purchase something. I don't think it's too big of an issue myself, but it may end up adding up which could really mess with the system. There will likely be some solutions for this coming up soon.

### Reply 2:
In the current situation, the encrypted currency is still in the early stages of growth. I don't think it will take too long. Maybe in ten years, maybe within a few years, we can more freely use the encrypted currency to buy movie tickets, coffee, pay salaries, etc.

I would like to securely hold my bitcoins and control my own private keys but preferably without having to run a full node. The ""pruning feature"" certainly helps but it takes so long to update if the client hasn't been run in a while. Paper wallets (or strongly encrypted paper wallets in a file) seem like the best option to me, however if I want to then trade some of those coins quickly, how do I do it? What types of wallets allow you to quickly and easily import a paper wallet?What about a bitcoin core wallet - can it be quickly and easily imported into anything besides a core client?I am vaguely aware of hardware wallets but don't really understand how they work.

Electrum is supposed to be better than hardware wallets? Shouldn't it be the other way around? Care to elaborate more??

### Reply 2:
If you are holding hundreds of bitcoins and will not be moving them for a while, it is best to have a hardware wallet like trezor.But if you only have a few bitcoin that you continually move around for trading and expenses, you can use light weight wallet like electrum or maybe since it is just small value, a web wallet like blockchain.info will do. I do altcoin tradings, and if it is just small value of alts, I do not transfer it to my own wallet. I leave it on the exchange. Since I am trading, it will lessen the expense on tx fees when moving it to wallet to exchange and vice versa.But if I have considerable amount for a certain coin, I move it to my desktop wallet since I only have large amount of alts if I am holding it for a long time.

There have been a lot of discussion lately about the different implementations and the way people think it should be done. Let's find out if people are still happy with the way the Bitcoin Core team are managing things and what their issues is. On a scale from less than 10% to 100% ....stipulate your satisfaction with the current team of people running the show. Let's steer away from specific individuals and just concentrate on the team. If you have suggestions on how to improve their inputs, please add them in your comments. Let's also give credit, if you feel they are doing a good job. Less than 10% is pretty bad, and 100% is perfect ....Enjoy. -

CIYAM you have a right to your opinion and a right to express it... I have not stated in any way that this poll is indicative of any proof of anything, but rather an attempt at improving the team with constructive criticism. I have no problem with them, other than the long delay in doing something about the Block size increase. I do however appreciate the cautious approach and the reason for thesedelays, because I acknowledge the risk to the security... if these changes are done in a rush and too quickly. Let's see how this turns out... even if it is sock puppet inflated.

Topic: Bitcoin is Deflationary,  and That's OK
### Original post:
New post at <link>

### Reply 1:
Good summary Etlase2, no one says that BTC can't be used in the way it's already been used, simply that it's economic model prevents it from ever scaling up to the size people want it too (irrespective of the inherent technical scaling issues that also rule that out), and that deflation has slowed to the adoption rate so far.Deflationary spirals are a description of society wide collapses of real productivity brought about by monetary deflation and because BTC is just so small it has no ability to create such an effect. Even a total collapse of BTC would just disperse people and productivity back into the wider economy, just as when a single bankruptcy disperses capacity back to the economy and dose not cause a crisis.So all BTC can really do is suffer a slower or even stagnated rate of adoption because of deflation. A negative rate of adoption (people leaving BTC) would naturally result in the value of BTC dropping, which is what happens when an alt-coin dies. If a coin was devised that was much more stable it could probably grow much faster then BTC.Also the 21 million coin cap is only one reason BTC is deflationary, and is actually not even a contributor now when supply is still<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 2:
""Making the rounds lately""? This is an ""argument"" that has existed essentially since the dawn of bitcoin's economic discussion. I don't actually think anyone ever really argued it though, I think it was the Austrian school bitcoin propaganda defense to a general argument that already existed for the benefits of fiat over harder money (whether or not it is true), not bitcoins per se.However, common sense would suggest a deflationary spiral is quite likely to never occur in bitcoin unless bitcoins are used up and down the line of production and salaries are commonly paid in bitcoin. Until then, fiat must implicitly exist alongside bitcoin. So, should a ""spiral"" start occurring at any point before ubiquity, people will simply switch back to fiat and stop the spiral. This is bitcoin's ultimate failing as a replacement for fiat.""First of all, the present value of a perpetually appreciating asset is not infinity."" - This is not related to the argument of a deflationary spiral.""Second, there is a liquid market for Bitcoins."" - This is under the assumption that bitcoin is not ubiquitous, and therefore has not replaced fiat and means that there is an option for people to use besides bitcoin<rest of post truncated>

### Original post:
Everyone who is into bitcoin has heard this story before.A guy cloned his hard drive and threw away the wrong drive in the trash and knows it was in a landfill site. Think they made a episode on the US sitcom series Big Bang Theory out of it.But the story didn't end there as the person wants to have permission to excavate the site looking for this hard drive with over $275 million worth at today's price of bitcoin.""A man from the Welsh city of Newport has offered his city council a 25% cut of his 7,500 bitcoins if it allows him to excavate the landfill where he threw away a hard drive containing the fortune in 2013.""source: <link> is willing to give the city of Newport in the UK a cut of the bitcoin at a sum of $70 million so to be able to do this with approval of their local government.This story has been run all around the globe at this point and has alot of people scratching their heads as to why he would need permission to rummage around a landfill site in garbage. Alot of countries allow those who want to go around their local trash site looking for pop cans for recycling or whatever they want to bring out of it. Since it is just garbage there.<link> it the green initiate if y<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
There are some very strict rules regarding landfill and recycling centres in the UK. The land is owned by a local council and they will NEVER let a member of the public go looking through any rubbish. Imagine someone going rummaging and they manage to get a used syringe needle stuck into themselves - this person could then easily sue the council. This man unfortunately, will NEVER have any chance of getting his hard drive back

### Reply 2:
I seriously doubt that the data will still be there to be retrieved, because under ideal conditions, hard drives are predicted to be able to retain their data for 9 to 20 years. So I should say... a landfill are less than ideal conditions and his hard drive has been there for almost 8 years now. We have not even consider that corrosive fluids will hasten the deterioration of the physical disc and also rust and the pressure that was placed on this hard drive with material that was placed on top of it.

Topic: Whatever happens, hold on to your Bitcoin.
### Original post:
There is growing excitement in the Bitcoin community following the gains recorded by Bitcoin. The reason for this growth is hardly unconnected to rumors of Bitcoin ETF approval. Have we thought about what will happen to Bitcoin price should all the ETF get rejected? I don't want to imagine this but whatever happens, hold on to your Bitcoin. There have been bull run without Bitcoin ETF and there will always be bull run even if the ETF is rejected. So even when the market temporarily nosedives if the ETF is rejected, do not panic. Once again, hold on to your Bitcoin and do not panic.

### Reply 1:
People get too excited about small pumps in the market, it brings the idea of the time to sell and make profit is at hand but, what becomes of you and the fiat or whatever coin/commodity your Bitcoin values is transferred into after you sell?You might just miss out of all the other events, bear market inclusive, which will come playing out after that.Many have the ideas of, they would have to buy again during the bears but, how often do you make it to that.Anyway, after the rain comes the shine and as such, being excited isnt out of place but, never get to sell all your coins.News on the continued approval of various ETF platforms might be a course for nothing but, I very much feel this is just happening as a bid by this platforms to actually take advantage of the expected bullrun, come next halving. You get to work with them to build yourself and them as well. Its a cool thing but, ensure your not loosing out on accumulating some Bitcoins.

### Reply 2:
I'm sure many are feeling good about the gains made by Bitcoin recently, but I think that holding Bitcoin no matter what is not a great strategy. If someone invested a long time ago, the current price might be good for that person to sell. Or, maybe a person wants to keep hodling but sell just a bit to enjoy the profits made due to recent gains. I think it's totally fine, and it is important to actually benefit from the profits once in a while. I agree that Bitcoin will probably rise with or without an ETF approval, but it can easily happen after another year of a bear market, for instance, so if someone wants to sell a bit now, it makes sense.

Topic: is bitcoin scalability problem solve now?
### Original post:
In 2017 there was the last civil war in bitcoin. This civil war gave rise to the hard fork to whom that gave birth to bitcoin cash. The reason for the war is because of bitcoin scalability. One part of the network wanted the fork that will make bitcoin have upto 200 and above TPS. But the order part of the network believe that if the change is apply it will lead to centralization of bitcoin. The result is bitcoin cash from bitcoin. Some week after the civil war. Pieter Wuille came out with segregated witness. But this one is soft fork. What seg wit did is to technically increase 1mb size of bitcoin block to 4mb. He did this by separating the bitcoin signature data from transaction data. So that there we be more space in the block to accept more transaction. The reason for this soft fork is to solve the scalability too.Lightening network has be there before the 2017 war. But is adopting slowly. The Lightening network use second layer bitcoin protocol to process transaction fast and small transaction fees. This one is design to happen not on the blockchain but will be add to the blockchain after transaction. The reason for this too is to solve the scalability. On november this year. <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Wrong. Signatures are still very much part of each transaction and are included in each block.The reason for SegWit soft-fork was many things (malleability fix, opening room for easy future deployment of new soft forks, ...), one of which was scaling.That is Schnorr signatures, Taproot is a lot more than that. There is already a lot of topics about it so I won't start explaining here.Same with SegWit (witness version 0) this is doing a lot more than just scaling.Scalability is not something you just solve once and be done with it. It is something you have to keep improving based on new development in technology and hardware.

### Reply 2:
Signatures are the important part of the transactions, which means they cannot be thrown away because if it were otherwise we would end up with the whole bunch of transactions that could be spent by literally anyone in the network. Segwit doesn't separate signature data from transaction data, it simply moves actual signature data and other data that is used to verify a transaction (aka ""witness data"") to a special part of a transaction called ""witness."" Non-SegWit nodes don't know that this special field of SegWit transaction even exists, but they still consider these transactions valid if miners that had upgraded to SegWit included them in a block. So, in SegWit the actual signature data remains a part of the transaction, but it is not visible for older nodes. The fact that these non-upgraded nodes don't see witness data along with other data in transactions gives people an illusion that this data is somehow ""separated"" while in reality, it is not.

### Reply 1:
i actually object to this, even though i see it commonly. there's a lot to like about bitcoin without treating it as a vehicle for personal investments. there are some things to dislike without wanting to take a personal bearish position.for one thing, appropriate positions depend on your personal financial profile, risk tolerance, and so on.but more importantly, 'bitcoin' is different from the particular block chain we've got. there are reasons to like bitcoin that have nothing to do with that block chain, for example. i think bitcoin has great promise in several areas, but i have no desire to buy bitcoins in the currently prominent block chain. that's perhaps because i mined a lot cheaply, but then telling me to 'sell' because of my various countervailing reservations about the propriety of some features of that block chain, and the way it's been marketed, would be overly simplistic.if you like bitcoin, it's fine to promote bitcoin and make arguments about it, though i wish that were generally done more honestly and less sleazily. if you dislike it, i'd like to hear your arguments too, and i'd hope other people would as well; maybe they're constructive criticism. i don't mean thi<rest of post truncated>

indeed. if i could never see another thread that advised others to sell or buy, i'd be very happy. maybe there should be more of a norm that those discussions go in the 'trading' forum rather than the main discussion board. they're like the worst of the penny-stock discussions on 'yahoo finance'. it's a bit pathetic too, because people think their posts are actually affecting the market. you get the feel they're writing with that in mind, as if it's not both futile and transparent.

Aren't media outlets in China owned by the government? If that's the case, this means that the Chinese are softening up for bitcoin and could potentially issue yet another statement regarding their support for bitcoin and other related services. Or it could just be another statement to piss off the Americans, knowing that the USD has been pretty much weakening as days are passing by. Either way, the Chinese are planning to get involved by prepping up the media, and releasing such statements just helps with that.

Bitcoins status as a hedge against uncertainty also gains further significance when compared with the performance of mainstream haven assets like gold, and currencies like the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen.

Topic: Bitcoin will boost like a rocket after this Friday (Eid Festival Celebration)
### Original post:
As all of the Muslims are withdrawing their money for this Eid which will be on the coming Friday or Saturday the price of bitcoin is reducing. After that none of them will need that money and they will recover their previous portfolio and for that they will buy back their bitcoin which they sold now. The price of bitcoin will rise again. Stay tuned as it is June and the price of bitcoin will boost like a rocket.

### Reply 1:
because before the bitcoin celebration will fall in price, for example yesterday before the price of bitcoin prices had fallen, and after the price returns stable

### Reply 2:
I also thought of the same, though there's a chance that there are different Muslims who don't treat it as such. But tbh, I don't see a strong link of Eid on the price losing steam since most of the time, BTC/USD doesn't care whatevee holiday it is; no matter how the weather, what event it is, BTC/USD always trades and therefore never loses people doing some action behind the graphs. Hopefully this is true, since price just broke one key support earlier thiss day, and that's increasingly worrying I should say.

Topic: Trying to get my head around something that I can't find addressed any where
### Original post:
Okay, this involves saving my earned Bitcoins:So, say, I have 20 coins saved up on my laptop and 10 on my PC. Where exactly is this file that stores my Bitcoins? How do I save them? I read the savings account thread, but it doesn't address how to actually make a savings account. Say if I want to reformat my HDD, how do I save it all? I know I can send it from one PC to another via transfers, but That is the part I don't understand. At first I thought the coins where stored in a permenent wallet that was the Address, but found that is common to change. Where are my bitcoins? What file do I save to hold my coins? How do I load that file to transfer them to my savings? I can't find anything ANYWHERE on the subject. I'm sorry it sounds noobish, but I did look all over the place before posting this. I am clearly missing something, possibly obvious, but it is definitely discouraging trying to get in on this hopefully future of currency but not having it laid out in clear terms. It's little things like this that need clarifying.

### Reply 1:
Hey thanks Yrall! That is definitely a step in the right direction. I really wish this forum had a sticky that went over the simple things like this. It seems that there is a lot of already presumed knowledge with little to no direction on these sorts of things.Could you or some one else point me in the direction of how this wallet is utilized? How exactly do I load this wallet to transfer money to and from it? Again, sounds dumb, I know, but I really can't find a decent step-by-step any where.

### Reply 2:
I personally keep my savings wallet on a USB drive with another bitCoin client running on it (run it using a dat file).I do most of my bitcoin stuff on my laptop. So I collect coins from mining on my 'native' install of BitCoin, than when its time to transfer to savings, I send some coins to my 'offline' wallet file on the USB drive.Once a week or so I load up the USB drive, decrypt it, and sync down the block chain.Once my balance is up to date I encrypt, eject, and stash it away again.

Topic: Anyone making a MMORPG based on bitcoin?
### Original post:
Does anyone know if there is a MMORPG on the horizon using bitcoin as in-game economy?It would be awesome if a game like EVE would use this as currency.A lot more fun than a casino game

### Reply 1:
I don't know that much about video games, but last I heard this exists:EVE corporation that has ISK -> 1Bitcoin shares -> MPOE shares on mpex.co -> bitcoinalso theres this:<link>The game currency will be divided into five tiers, with the lowest coin worth 100 satoshi and the highest 100 BTC. All consumables craftables, skills etc will be divided into five tiers as well....

### Reply 2:
It is a casino, but it's the first MMORPG casino, and it's entirely Bitcoin based. It's also among the first sites to take Bitcoin, and has been in continuous operation since October 2010. I previously developed A Tale in the Desert.Dragon's Tale: <link>

Topic: Bitcoin are not by nature money, but money consists by its nature of bitcoin？
### Original post:
Marx mentioned in ""A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy""1. ""Gold and silver are not by nature money"" means that gold and silver are not inherently currency. Because gold and silver first appeared in the market as a general commodity, only when the commodity exchange developed to a certain historical stage, a fixed commodity of equivalent value was needed as a medium of exchange, called general equivalent, when the general equivalent was concentrated on gold and silver. When gold and silver are fixedly used as general equivalents, it is currency. Because gold and silver do not become currency as soon as they come to the world.2. ""money consists by its nature of gold and silver"", which means that money should be born of gold and silver, or that gold and silver are born with the excellent characteristics of being currency, which is determined by the natural properties of gold and silver.So can we deduce the process of Bitcoin becoming a general equivalent from the process of gold and silver becoming a general equivalent?1.gold was very valuable in ancient times.The ancient smelting technology is relatively poor, and it is impossible to make copper, iron and other metals<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
This is the mission of Bitcoin, but to be honest, its better to call it digital thing. It is not a general equivalentMaybe the definition of finance is a little bit different from what we understand. I need to study the intrinsic value you mentioned.There seems to be no necessary connection between the two. The current currency has no intrinsic value, but serves as a general equivalent.It is indeed a good asset.Yes, it is not difficult if you want to learn Bitcoin. Just like people use online shopping, you dont need to learn the basics of the Internet, you just need to use it.

### Reply 2:
Bitcoin is an electronic money created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. ... Unlike currencies in general, bitcoin does not depend on trusting the main issuer. bitcoin can be used for anything, because the value of bitcoin is so fantastic, in the end most bitcoins are used as assets to invest, because if we are patient we will definitely profit what we get can be 2 times the price we buy,

Topic: The Best Way To Encourage Offline Store To Accept BTC
### Original post:
This can be challeging but, i have tried the strategy below:walk into any offline store i.e (restaurant) and ask one of the staff that you will like to speak with the the management of the restaurant.Most people will direct you straight to the management, other's might want to know the reason behind such request.just be prepare for follow-up response;If, you are given the opportunity, open your presentation in this manner; I'm interested in promoting your services/product's on bitcoin related forum!Do you know you'll be losing 35%-45% of your customer's (tourist) who uses bitcoins?At this point be prepared to tell them more about bitcoin.Close your presentation, try to be brief as possible.Remember to make reference to bitcointalk forum, because it offer's more information (foundation) with comprehensive lesson about bitcoin & the use of bitcoin.Creation & distribution of short flyer's with same message will work fine for those who dislike meeting one-one with the management of offline <truncated>

### Reply 1:
The best way is to introduce bitcoin to them. Teach them what is bitcoin and how is transactions are done. Teach them how the price inflates and deflates. Teach them how it can help their business. Encouragement is useless if the store owner is not well versed with bitcoin, its operations, nature and transactions. It could only work if they know and understand what it is all about.

### Reply 2:
How about no? If the manager or everybody that works on the store doesn't know anything about bitcoin, then that would be a lot of work to someone who would be assigned to make their store accept bitcoins. You can do stuffs like <truncated> the manager to accept bitcoin but it's actually bugging me off because there's a lot of work that should be done before the whole thing could be implemented on their store.Bitcoin isn't like a product that you could introduce to someone and if they liked it, you would just give it to them or sell it to them and then they can use it right after. You have to understand the whole bitcoin thing before you could actually use it on your store as a mode of payment.

Topic: Retail users out?
### Original post:
After tested to max. pain limit during last 3 months and continuously suffering financially and mentally, I think the retail users have given up. If so, this is not good scenario. If soon there are no new & much positive vibes in the market, the things can go lower. Is not?? But my point of view is that in the highly sophisticated and versatile market there is a clause who stand till end will grow with market growth.

### Reply 1:
Retail users already out, this is why the price was fall... if they aren't out it won't hit $35K. They're scared of the market and can't relax, definitely they will sell in loss. After that, when the market recovered and the price back to $50K they will join again and buy with higher price.The thing is there're so many articles create bad news about Bitcoin while the fact it's a old news or unrelated, but many people believe it.

### Reply 2:
How do you really know, though? Having several weeks of red doesn't automatically mean that they're totally out. Also taking into consideration that a good chunk of money in bitcoin is still retail; if they were really totally out, we'd be far lower from here. (not saying retail needs to be out for us to have a bounce btw)

Topic: The big picture they've all been missing
### Original post:
First of all let me make this point clear: There's no Cryptos without BitcoinThe space largely has two main sides: the tech, blockchain and the money, cryptos. We have all been seeing various projects develop and some are as dumb as saying they'll kill Bitcoin lol. It can't happen (at least now that Bitcoin controls way more than 10+% of the market)So what all these new projects need to focus on is make sure to promote Bitcoin first. I say so because it is the bigger picture, and the hard truth.Come to think of it, What type of news didn't we hear about Ripple last year??? But Ripple nearly tumbled until the recent Bitcoin gains helped out. As for fake satoshi, hehee.... his story is funny!! trying to kill Bitcoin??? lol.. that's the dumbest thing to do, and now look at his coin lolHonestly, the mainstream valuate the whole space by the metrics of Bitcoin and so if you're a developer building anything and seeking mainstream adoption (which we definitely need), then you need to always promote BitcoinSo in a nutshell, the logic is that, as Bitcoin grows, we all grow together in untiy and strength because Bitcoin is what binds crypto and blockchain mainstream adoption.So let's stop th<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
You are correct mate bitcoin is the beggining of all no one can replace or kill it, those are just trying hard to promote their projects like example those forks saying they are the real bitcoin in fact there is only one with ""BTC"" Ticker. Blockchain is slowly growing and the birth of new altcoins is growing too. Big companies, Banks and merchant is slowly adapting too cryptocurrency will play a big part in the future.

### Reply 2:
All crypto requires Bitcoin, why? the logic is that every crypto made through ICO or IPO sales is bought with bitcoin or ethereum. But most people prefer bitcoin to save their funds, so the bitcoin network will never go out. Even though prices tend to go up and down, I'm sure it's part of the dynamics to keep bitcoin alive.

Topic: FBI uses bitcoin mixers from forfeiture processing.
### Original post:
Over the last eight years, U.S. law enforcement has seized a great number of bitcoins and at one time, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) held one of the largest bitcoin wallets after the Silk Road takedown. A recently published report shows the FBI has started using cryptocurrency mixing applications in recent times in order to obfuscate transactions from seized bitcoins that stem from a forfeiture.Source: <link> would they do that? Arrested person from doing criminal activities do that, so why do they? No transparency is a corrupted system.

### Reply 1:
Thank you for pointing out that it is not the real bitcoin but from the fake one. Still we cannot ignore the fact that FBI are shady agency that confiscate cryptocurrencies and not all of them are being presented as evidences. Heres a merit.

### Reply 2:
It is strange to see them making use of services that have been due illegal. Probably they are also making sure they destroy evidence get tracked. It is just like you do not believe in a process but you are making use of the process. For you, it is right but for other it is not. This exactly the reason why many do not like a centralized system of governance. You are only right in your own way.

Topic: Britain to scrap VAT taxes on Bitcoin trades
### Original post:
The Financial Times is reporting that the UK is to scrap taxes on Bitcoin trading. Here's a small quote from the article (behind a paywall) ""In a meeting with a group of UK traders last week, HM Revenue & Customs said it would not charge the 20 per cent VAT tax on trades, which entrepreneurs had complained made their businesses globally uncompetitive. HMRC went a step further, saying it would not charge the tax on their margins either.The ruling sidesteps the thorny question of whether to class Bitcoin as a currency, but effectively treats it as such, and bases its policy on the EU law that exempts payments and transfers of negotiable instruments from tax.""<link> to see pro-bitcoin policies being put in place in the UK. No doubt the City of London wants in on the trade.

### Reply 1:
Here's a link that isn't behind a paywall:<link> you may be misunderstanding what sort of tax this is. It isn't referring to income tax. It's referring to Value Added Tax, which is similar to a US Sales Tax.The previous ruling from HMRC was that VAT would be due on the sale of bitcoins as if they were an object or service, thus increasing the cost by 20% to the end user. That is not how trade in traditional currencies is treated in the UK; that would normally be outside the scope of VAT.The new ruling will treat bitcoin the same, which is obviously good news.

### Reply 2:
spoke to HMRC last yearbitcoins was ""out of scope"" to of been VAT required so VAT was not needed before. but atleast we now can 100% know that HMRC wont be requiring us to register for VAT officially now they have formally evaluated bitcoin. and all we have to do is pay income tax.YAY its official

Topic: Will my Ledger Nano replace my Metamask wallet or will they work hand-in-hand?
### Original post:
Hi all,Got some newbie questions related to hardware wallet here.I just bought some BEP-20 tokens during their ICO through their website to which my Metamask wallet is connected to.Also, I just placed an order for Ledger Nano S Plus. I'm just trying to imagine how this will fit in for these BEP-20 tokens and also for subsequent holdings of cryptocurrency.(1) After I receive my Ledger Nano, will it replace Metamask wallet entirely, or will it be used in conjunction with it? Do I need to transfer whatever tokens I have in Metamask to the Ledger Nano? If it is more like an integration, will they be maintaining 2 different public addresses or just one?(2) Can those newly launched ERC-20/BEP-20 tokens show up in Ledger Nano wallet? Or I have to just buy/hold those newly launched tokens using Metamask wallet, and only transfer to Ledger when they become supported?(3) Will the process of buying tokens during ICO be different after I switch to using Ledger Nano? Or will it still be the same, i.e., just go to the site and connect using Metamask wallet (perhaps with hardware wallet also plugged <truncated>

### Reply 1:
(1) When you created Metamask wallet, you had seed phrases. When you receive Ledger Nano, you will create a new wallet in it, for which a new seed phrase will be generated. These are completely different seed phrases, which means different wallets.Of course, tokens need to be transferred from Metamask wallet to Ledger wallet. Otherwise, why would you buy ardware wallet at all. But not directly, but after you connect Ledger wallet to Metamask and generate a new public address to which you send your tokens.(2) Its better for you to buy and hold these new tokens on Metamask (not the first one Metamask wallet), but the second one, which you will create by connecting Ledger device. I assume you will be able to transfer as soon as it is supported.(3) Everything will be exactly the same. If you connect with Metamask, you may not need a Ledger device, because this device is only needed to confirm outgoing transactions, and in your case, it will be an incoming transaction.

### Reply 2:
The same answer pretty much applies to all three questions: It can replace it, but it's probably best to use them together, Ledger Live (ledger's software) doesn't support all tokens/networks. So you need to send all of your funds from MetaMask to Ledger device, and then link the MetaMask with Ledger[1] so when you're using dapps, you want to receive funds, etc. you would just do that from MetaMask, and when you want to send funds, you can also use MetaMask, but you would still need to authorize payments from the Ledger device.[1] <link>

Topic: bitcoin address generated so far vs total address ever
### Original post:
what is the total number of private keys that can ever be generated and what percentage of keys has been generated as of now..how long will it take to run out of all possible keys?

### Reply 1:
Having just imported the blockchain into a Mysql DB I see a total of 42,150,031 (as of block 311761) public key hashes and total amount of address out there I believe are 16^160 or <truncated> 42.1M number are only addresses that sent or received bitcoin so far, it is not a reflection of all addresses that have been generated.So it will be a while before we run out.

### Reply 1:
If it so happens that he actually will soon gain control over more than a million BTC, let him sell. Sure, the price will likely drop by a lot, but I only see that as a buy opportunity. Bitcoin will rise back up as quickly as it dropped. In the long term, it's nothing but a small blip on the price charts.

### Reply 2:
Take it easy, mate! On the contrary, if he is the real Satoshi, he would not even be entertaining the thought of selling it. I have a strong feeling that Satoshi was not cocky, very much unlike this Craig Wright. I don't think Satoshi would just let his creation crumble to the ground just to prove his real identity. Satoshi was a genius, not a moron.

### Original post:
If so, I'd like to add my 6 mBTC to it!

### Reply 1:
That's correct. There is no way to know if somebody own the private key that has to be used to spend an unspent output.Offcourse, there are a couple addresses known that have been used to ""burn"" bitcoins, for example: <link> not because an unspent output hasn't been spent for years and years that it's automatically ""inaccesible"". It might also be a cold storage address.

### Reply 2:
the problem is most people in topics like these are claiming they have lost some amount but we don't know whether they really lost it or it was stolen or even possible that they have recovered it at some point. for example someone who forgot his password might have remembered it 2 years later and recovered the 250BTC he claimed he lost.

Topic: Bitpay merchant sign-up incentive scheme
### Original post:
We all want more of our local bars, restaurants and shops to accept bitcoin, right?Bitpay should offer an incentive for bitcoin enthusiasts to encourage their local businesses to accept bitcoin.There could be a standard bitpay leaflet with a space for a unique code for each person doing the leg work and perhaps a 0.1 btc bounty for each merchant signed up.Your thoughts?

### Reply 1:
Not sure what bitpay offers but I believe coinbase offers 0% fees on the first $1million in transactions as one of their promotions. That's pretty enticing imo.

### Reply 2:
They used to have an affiliate program that was kind of like that. But since they changed their pricing model, they are having to revamp it. They are working on that now from what I understand.

Topic: Cryptocurrency Forks are bait, a scam to get the seeds to (all?) wallets.
### Original post:
To start with: the Bitcoin-Gold blockchain <link> does NOT recognize Bitcoin addresses -- this prevents Bitcoin holders from claiming their Bitcoin Gold. (eg the valid Bitcoin Address -- <truncated> -- is not recognized by the Bitcoin-gold blockchain.) Very SIMPLE SCAM: when you open a BTCG wallet and try to claim your BTCG you give the scammers your seed so they can clean out your wallet. BUT - FAR-FAR WORSE: -- On WINDOWS the BTCG-Electrum Wallet puts a startup-program on your computer that you CANNOT delete until you uninstall the electrum bTCG wallet -- and even then you cannot be sure that malware is not left behind to access and drain all the other wallets on your computer... and perhaps all future wallets you put on your computer.. Please do not be stupid enough to assume that those people who put videos on UtUBE that show you how to ""SAFELY "" claim the new Fork-coins ... do not assume they are not a crucial part of the scam.

### Reply 1:
You are not the first person that are making these claims. A lot of people are saying that these claims are nothing other thanconspiracy theories, but I think there is a little bit of truth to it. What would be the easiest way to get to people's Private keys? Answer : Fork Bitcoin and give people FREE coins and force them to use a specific wallet to redeem those coins. Hidesome backdoor in the wallet or service that you use to claim those FREE coins. This is why we are telling people to move their coins before they claim these FREE coins.

### Reply 2:
i think what the OP is saying is this:dont just move coins to a new address if your old wallet was a HD seed wallet, ensure the new address is from a legacy private key and not just a fresh address using you HDwallet seed, after all even if the funds have moved.. using a HD seed that also points to your new address still put your moved funds at risk

In many cases, I hope the government will tax the bitcoin, which will make us feel relieved that even if the price will temporarily drop but then rise steadily, the lack of bitcoin is recognized by the government and the lucrative industry really needs to be regulated Or norms, or it will be full of all kinds of scams, illegal acts.

### Reply 2:
Paying government contribution with the use of crypto and paying tax with it is just natural, since every transaction you made with them are with tax anyway, and let this matter be a reason for other countries to open up.

### Original post:
Would the best thing to do now not be to get out now while Bitcoin is worth at least three times it's low price this year. All small holders get their money out now. Let it fall. And then buy back low. Then everyone will get a chance of cheap Bitcoin not just whales.

### Reply 1:
If the price is low, Big Miners will either stop or switch(Not an option as of now). This is scary

### Reply 2:
I just had this thought when it looked Bitcoin was totally crashing. But it has gone up again. Should we worry to much about miners as they have probably made a lot of money already. But many ordinary people have lost money. And there is Bitcoin already so would it matter to much if miners stopped mining.

### Original post:

### Reply 1:
Goldman sachs have bashed bitcoin, and bashed cryptocurrency numerous times over the years. It's almost like they have an agenda against it.... It's quite obvious that bitcoin in its current iteration will not be the global cryptocurrency, there are some flaws that need to be ironed out first, including transaction fee and confirmation timing. Luckily bitcoin can fork, so this is only a temporary issue.

### Reply 2:
If he believes in the blockchain he should also know that blockchain comes with BTC. For another cryptocurrency to emerge you need a different network. Blockchain will run BTC and that's all there is to know, you either believe in both of them or you can already stop wasting your time here and watching the altcoin scene. That said, at some point we may need something better, but who says that this new cryptocurrency will not be an upgraded version of BTC? The software allows for so much tinkering that you can basically rewrite it all and still have the same BTC, just forked and updated 100 times along the way.

Topic: EBAY might accept BITCOIN
### Original post:
Hey guys theres a news article stating that ebay might be accepting Bitcoin and other cryptos, if this happens then I believe itll be a game changer for the crypto world. Not sure how credible the article is , has anyone else heard anything similar. Also there was mention of an announcement on march 10 to confirm this. If positive, We could see a new high even in these times uncertainty .

### Reply 1:
Should have posted the link where you read about this. But I have been hearing Ebay will be accepting bitcoin for years, but never saw them make a move or do anything about it. Or it is just one of the ""may accept"" article. We have been reading this kind of articles a lot. Probably a click bait or articles that are trying to spread FOMO (if its from one of those shitty websites) like those bitgirt articles we are seeing everywhere made by analyticsinsight.

### Reply 2:
Understandable in this case. All those big platforms that announced integrations with NFTs or cryptocurrencies in general has been shat on by the public on social media. A perfect example would be Discord a few months ago LOL. <link>

Topic: Microstrategy added another $15 million bitcoin to assets
### Original post:
Apparently, the Microstrategy, the company active in the field of business intelligence is endless, as the company's CEO Michael Silver recently announced another $15 million purchase. Silver announced on Twitter that the company had bought another 253 BTC at an average price of $59,339.Thus, the total Microstrategy assets reached 91579 bitcoins at a cost of $ 2.226 billion, which were purchased at an average price of $24311.At the current price of Bitcoin, the total market value of the company's assets reaches $ 5.376 billion, which has resulted in an unrealized profit of $3.15 billion or a 140% return.This recent microstrategy purchase is another evidence of Silver's strong belief in this leading cryptocurrency. Over time, and thanks to large corporate buyers such as microstrategy, the bitcoin ecosystem is evolving.Grayscale, was also the first company to launch the Bitcoin Mutual Fund in the United States, which played a key role in the evolution of Bitcoin.Source: <link>

### Reply 1:
Adding 15 million USD to a BTC portfolio,which is worth 2.226 billion USD isn't that much.Should we pay attention to such news?Everyone knows that Grayscale is very bullish and optimistic towards the future of Bitcoin.I guess that they will continue buying more BTC,even if there's a price correction.Using debt to buy Bitcoins is a very risky move.Grayscale would need big enough reserves to pay off such debt,when the Bitcoin price starts going down.

### Reply 2:
Yes, I follow Saylor and he is going all in with Bitcoin. He is not going to stop buying. Time will tell if he is a genious or a fool.That's not a rumor, that's news. They sold convertible debt to buy Bitcoin.

Topic: BTCs sent on paper wallet after 1st august on existing paper wallet...
### Original post:
Hi,I was wondering what will happen with BTCs bought after 1st of august and then sent to a paper wallet on which there are already BTCs...Imagine this paper wallet had 1 BTC before 1st of august.It should have 1BTC + 1BCC after 1st of august.If you buy and send on it 1BTC after 1st of august, you'll have 2BTC and 1 BCC on it right ?And then is there any issue if you want to withdraw BTC or BCC ??Thanks in advance

### Reply 1:
Hey, I don't know about your paper wallet. Did you ever figure it out? I think if you control your private keys you are able to get access to your Bitcoin Cash even if you had Bitcoin on a paper wallet, but I am not 100% sure. Let me know if you figure it out!

Topic: Destroy Bitcoin Foundation?
### Original post:
I've been reading a lot but writing few about the Bitcoin Foundation. It seems most of you don't have a good image of this foundation, since they made a lot of mistakes.I have three puntual questions about it and I would like to hear opinions:1.- Is Bitcoin Foundation <truncated> what your answer 1 is) If yes: why should we support it?If no: why would you like to destroy it?2.- What were the mistakes made by the Foundation? Did they do something to fix the errors?3.- What is your alternative proposition to Bitcoin Foundation? And if it's running, I would like to know what is it?

### Reply 1:
I don't think bitcoin is going anywhere except legislative death without a lobby group. A lot of people think the government should do this or that, they do not hear you and are not interested in listening. They do however listen to lobbyists. It's not cool, but that is the way it is. I am aware of no other effort to provide guidance to the government in regulating bitcoin. Make no mistake, there are new laws coming. The only question is whether they will be made with input from the bitcoin community or just made up by regulators who don't even understand it. Here in the U.S. that is the greatest threat to bitcoin.

### Reply 2:
1) No, it's not necessary but we can't do anything about that. All we can reiterate is that they're a centralized organization of a decentralized idea and they don't necessarily support the whole community. 3). We don't need one, but at the end of the day anyone could create their own foundation. The current one isn't the ""official"" one and I don't see how it ever could be.

Just have a look at the market yourself you'll see that investing a few months before is a good time as well as right after a fork when people are dumping their coins.

Topic: Why do people want Bitcoin?
### Original post:
Why do people want Bitcoin?Bitcoins act as new currencies in the digital age. It can cross borders without any banks or governments.The recent boom in Bitcoin may be great news for those who put money here early. But it also made it possible for Bitcoin to become a distant currency.I can now use my Bitcoin number to buy stuff at Overstock or book a hotel at Expedia. But if I use Bitcoin to buy $ 25 on the Overstock today, and next week Bitcoin prices will increase fourfold, I'll feel that stock is $ 100. If Bitcoin loses its price, at least I still have the stock to use.Bitcoins are considered as a kind of asset, instead of currency, with great profit expectations later on.

### Reply 1:
Bitcoin is a crypto currency and can be convertible to any other currency as everyone in the world are trying to earn more and more money because money is the basic need of life and bitcoin is a currency which have very high price and can be easily earn so that is why everyone want bitcoin.

### Original post:
If there is one place in the world that doesn't have money and can't get access to the world through banking oppression, it is the Gaza strip. Would it be feasible to set up a bitcoin exchange in Gaza to help them rebuild after the USA-funded, err, I mean, Israeli attack? This is just so sickening I feel we must do something, and the entire world has just now flipped their opinion. Protests in many major cities support Gaza. Celebrities are joining the cause for peace by the dozen, and the hashtag #GazaUnderAttack is trending a lot with 20k tweets per hour.Can we set up a center there to help fund a humanitarian rebuilding effort?

I'm also becoming more sickened by the day with this, if there were a charity that accepted BTC then why not, but so few are allowed into Gaza. The Red Cross are allowed to check on Palestinian prisoners, but theyre not even allowed to report on their condition or they won't be allowed back in. Anyway, one way to do it is to boycott Israeli products, which is working very well:<link> to see Duetche Bank boycotting an Israeli bank; really brave - especially for a German bank! (I have a few German friends who say it's very hard for them to talk about Israeli crimes because, well, 'they' were doing something similar to Jews not so long ago... but I digress).Also, a very easy and quick way to boycott Israeli products is to check the barcode of anything you buy, if it's got 729 as the first 3 digits it's from Israel. If they don't get $ from exported goods, they can't buy weapons from the US and they can't give the Palestinians cancer (among other things they give them):<link> scariest thing is the way the media treat this stuff.

Yes because people get ridiculous and somehow must up stealing with bitcoins. Maybe it is to make sense of it for them. I don't think people who jump to these conclusions are sharpest knives in the drawer. It is interesting to hear about this I'm sure so many people have though about this or are doing this. You see ""news"" has to sell so the sensationalize everything to gain attention and make more profits.

### Reply 2:
I'm not saying he has an excuse for stealing but come on! A computer systems manager making ~$19USD per hour in New York City ...and he's the thief?!He shouldn't be pulling in less than $40/hr. They might have done him a favour and fired him so he'd have to find a better paying computer systems manager job.edit: Just looked up NYC school secretary salary and they make 60k per year after 10 years of service. Something fishy about the story (at least the value of the fine)

Topic: How to kill Bitcoin?
### Original post:
I searched how to kill Bitcoin on the search box and saw nothing, so I'll just start a new one.Is it true that miners are the one responsible for every transactions?If yes; why didn't the government of China just ban cryptocurrency mining or am I just missing something out?If there are no transactions or maybe just less than 10 made transaction happened within 24 hours, how will the mining computer work then?, will it just go idle?What if people decided to hodle their coins, will it be unfair for the miners?

### Reply 1:
Well why should we kill bitcoin ? Bitcoin is said to be so helpful and it is really a good thing that people may gain an extra income and they can have a financial freedom and maybe people really know about it.that is why bitcoin today is really getting popular i really cant imagine life without bitcoin because bitcoin is really helpful and we can see that it makes our life a colorful life each day.

### Reply 2:
China doesn't have majority of miners and even if chinese government will decide to ban crypto mining there are thousands of other miners around the world who will be happy to expand their mining power to get maximum profit out of mining. Node operator and miners are responsible for stability of bitcoin network, it will be alive until there will be node operators and miners. No any government can shut down all nodes/mining facility around the world at the same time that's why nobody can stop bitcoin or kill bitcoin network.

### Original post:
The kidnappers who abducted an EXMO Finance employee in Ukraine have reportedly released him after they were paid a ransom of $1 million in Bitcoin, according to a report from Reuters. The victim, blockchain expert Pavel Lerner, had been seized by a group of masked assailants on December 26..EXMO released a statement on its website that confirmed that Lerner is now safe and recovering from the ordeal: At the moment, he is safe, and there was no physical harm inflicted on him. Nevertheless, Pavel is currently in a state of major stress, therefore, he will not provide any official comments in the coming days..The company has also stressed that Lerners role at EXMO did not provide him with access to user financial assets, and that the exchanges platform continues to operate normally. The online statement noted that the abduction story has overgrown with rumors that might tamper with the official investigation and suggested that the company would not be offering further comment on the matter in the nearest future..Officials in Kiev have acknowledged that the police are currently investigating a kidnapping that took place in that citys Obolon district, but have yet to confirm whether Le<rest of post truncated>

Potential solution for Bitcoin client: Use secure desktop to enter passwords (ala KeePass), which means they'd have to write a hardware keyboard driver to record the keyboard.Potential solution for users: Store wallet in a KeePass database and set it to enter passwords on secure desktop.Situation: Private keys are extracted directly from memory, despite an encrypted wallet and password entered on a secure desktop.Potential solution for Bitcoin client: Store private keys in secure memory storage service. Only store the keys in memory for a limited time, blank the memory after use.

### Reply 2:
Potential solution for Bitcoin client: Enable the use of two-factor authentication which requires the transaction to be signed by a second key on another device (eg smartphone, special online service, another Bitcoin client,...)

### Original post:
Hi all,I don't know what to say but I see many topics started by newbies and even old members without any value, just asking questions that have been answered thousands of times.Please use search before posting anything, maybe you will find what you are looking for.If another member writed a satisfying answer, just send him a merit point (without repeating his answer).Do not discuss the same topic over and over again.That is all, I had to say it because what I read is making me angry.

Where's the google-based search? Is it what i'm doing? Going to google then ask a question then include bitcointalk at the end? Thanks in advance.Damright questions are asked every other day, with the same topic but different approach in asking. I can't reply since i think everything was already laid off.

### Reply 2:
It's kind-off what you are doing, except you are not only typing bitcointalk; you need to include <truncated> (without the quotations). This expression would force google to only show results from that site, rather than using the keyword, bitcointalk, which could also show results from other other websites with that keyword. It saves time from filtering through multiple websites to find what is relevant.

In three instances in the original post and in the thread title, read ""Bitscapler"" as ""Bitscalper"".Scalp is a verb, the relevant meaning of which is: To buy and sell securities or commodities for small quick profits. Thus, scalper, noun: one who scalps.

Topic: Tucker vs Chase Bank USA  (Chase caught scamming again)
### Original post:
I just unexpectedly received a check in the mail made out to myself, stating on it ""Tucker vs Chase, N.A. Settlement"". It wasn't for very much, but it's always nice to get free money. The funny thing is, I had no clue what this was even for. I did a quick google search and here's what I found...what a shocker, JP Morgan Chase Bank scamming again.. I thought I'd try and make others aware, I'm sure there are others here who should be receiving the same.<link>

### Reply 1:
not exactly free money.for you to be a 'victim' of the fee's scam. you have probably already paid fee when you done bitcoin trades in the past. so more likely a refund of those fees. thus it was your money in the first place.so was it an amount that can be considered as the amount of bank charges you paid. or was it more and a 'discretionary compensation amount' ontop of any fee refund amount.other things to note. is that chase has always had a 'cash advance' policy. however it was actually the bitcoin exchange that when processing payments. the exchange informed the bank the purpose of the payment was 'cash advance' and not 'purchase'exchanges do this to avoid customers doing 'chargebacks' because banks wont chargeback a 'cash advance'so i see this as a mistake made by exchanges not informing customers that their deposits are being handled as 'cash advances'..maybe tucker can sue the exchanges next, as it was the exchanges that put customers into a 'loan' situation.but what i can see happening is chase next drops serving exchanges that request 'cash advances'

### Reply 2:
If you remember the market crash back in 2018, then you will understand why Chase pull up such malpractices! It's great that law stood by the right side and didn't give up in front of the banking lobby! Jemie was super hostile about bitcoin back in 2017 and 2018 which probably have resulted such malpractices from Chase! Now they are learning their lessons and slowly started showing positivity towards it. Congrats for the free money anyway!

Since MtGox the Regulation Rhetoric has escalated a lot. Duh, I'm stating the obvious.What I didn't expect to see what people from the BitCoin community begging to make BitCoin into something that is absolutely no different from the Fiat money we already have.I'm fixing to cash out simply on the basis that, if there's no damn difference anyway, why bother? We're talking about ushering in a new tier of professionals... Really? This debacle has made BitCoin grow up...? Seriously?This is total self destruction much, much worse than what MtGox did... There is no substitute for freedom. 5 years into the experiment that was BitCoin, they all cried out in unison for the warm blanket of slavery to take care of them, because the bumps and bruises were too much to learn from.I truly f*cking hate the human race.

There's a lot of people who use bitcoin on a basis of greed: they don't care about the philosophy or purpose, they don't really care about its long term success, they don't care about getting others to use bitcoin, they're not interested in ever buying or selling anything with bitcoin. They just want to make short term gain.They're the sort of people who don't speculate on the stock market because they know they would lose their shirt or it seems too hard for them.Bitcoin is easy for them, and the greed draws them in. Then they get burnt and immediately go crying to anyone who will listen.To them, the idea of the government swooping in, seizing funds and returning them as much as possible is a pleasant fantasy.You only need to look at the increased interest in transparency, services which have no access to private keys, and decentralised exchanges to see that bitcoin really is growing up.If you only listen to the people who were not equipped to speculate, ignored all warning signs of MtGox and then got burnt, you are clearly not going to get a good picture of things.Cashing out because of these people seems a bit of a knee-jerk reaction, but it doesn't really matter.

Hello pabpete, This is a good question and rarely explained well. As a business owner myself I tried to get answers to this very question because of several issues involved in excepting BTC or any other crypto currency for that matter for my business operations. Try and think about the business side of accepting BTC. Unless businesses can pay their employees, utilities, equipment maintenance, inventory, or any of the other long list of business expenses with crypto currencies the crypto currencies themselves are completely useless to them. So the minute I saw companies like Overstock.com and TigerDirect.com jump onboard to accept BTC I got curious. I started doing a lot of research to answer your very question here because I had to same one. These companies are accepting BTC so how do they handle the exchange rates? This, by the way, is another issue that business have to contend with. Or do they?The answer got simple as soon as I found both bitpay.com and coinbase.com. The businesses accepting the BTC for their products and services are not subject or exposed to the exchange rate of BTC when you make your purchase. When you order from tigerdirect.com and your invoice comes out to <rest of post truncated>

I'm pretty sure Tiger is using Bitpay as its transaction manager, so the conversion rate will be based upon whatever it is said to be by Bitay. You should be able to find the exchange rates here: <link>

just playing with numbers little bit WinkSome say Bitcoin may be the Gold of the future.If we assume that the future generation will more likely use Bitcoin as a store of value rather than hiding a bar of gold under their pillow what would that mean?The amount of Gold that is used as a store of value is around 40,000 tonnes worldwide.1 ton gold = 41,500,000 $40,000 tonnes x 41,500,000 $ = 1,660,000,000,000 (1,660 Billion $)divided by the total number of Bitcoin we come to1 BTC = +79,000$

### Reply 1:
Interesting that you count only the gold which is used as a store of value. If you think that Bitcoin can replace all gold, its value will come out to be higher. Of course, if Bitcoin is really successful, it will replace not just gold, but a big portion of the money supply as well.

### Reply 2:
Yeah and if you see that Gold is only one part in a portfolio its getting even better Take the stock market for example, its about 60,000 billion $ (only stock market , no derivatives etc.)If we assume that in the future people will have 10% of their portfolio in bitcoin instead of stock market it would add another 6,000 billion dollar.which is per Bitcoin 285,000 $ and then the real estate market etc. yeah it may be a bright future for the early adopters

Topic: Russia to legalize Crypto Mining Soon
### Original post:
Russian Deputy Minister of Energy Evgeny Grabchak revealed statement about introducing clear regulations for crypto mining in the country. His statement served as a support for the cryptomarket and the miners within the country, because back in January cryptocurrency mining was banned in Russia.During the first national conference of legal crypto miners Grabchak called for introducing a regulatory framework for the sector at the earliest. In his statement he addedRussian government to legalize mining soon

### Reply 1:
Looking at the scenario ? is it Russia and Ukraine are competing in adopting crypto specially Bitcoin ? after China banning mining industries for crypto now Russia will adopt and open their doors to miners?nice strategy for both country and they seems to be conniving on how they will have power inside crypto as this is one of the largest profit provider nowadays.

### Reply 2:
I feel pity about Russian government. Russia was always negative about cryptocurrency and its legislation. Now when they are getting cut off from the world due to various international bans and sanctions, they are finding cryptocurrency can save them from such situations. This is nonsense! Russia is learning the hard way that cryptos can indeed help their economy in case of an isolation. I hope this incident will put some sense on other governments who are opposing the inclusion of cryptocurrency in their economy.

Other commitments have prevented me from dedicating as much time as I'd like to, and I am also at a stage in life where I think I should focus on other priorities.Some of you may know I had (and still have) a small dice/crypto site at <link> and a example site is <link> Unfortunately, I no longer have the time to actively manage it, although I am trying to allocate more time to the crypto world again.I've been contemplating this for a while, but decided to share what I've made with the community. Hopefully, the source code helps someone somewhere and inspires more games, and more uses for the cryptocurrency world.The full source, with a README that I've tried to elaborate as much as possible can be found on GitHub here: <link> OR if you'd prefer a direct link, here: <link> I'd appreciate if you could use the shortened link as I am generally quite obsessed about data , so it'd be good to see how many hits I get from this, just for the fun of it.Thank you for the fun times !Again, the source is at:Source: <link> OR <link>

I really gotta know because I am about to book a flight yet I don't know where to get a ticket and, in case they are limited, if I can even get my hands on one.Some info about this would be much appreciated since I searched for every single bit of info but just didn't get this little riddle solved =/

### Reply 1:
yes I tries searching everywhere. Bitcointalk, google, the unsystem website..... is this event still planned? is it going to happen? on the unsystem website a lot of people ask about the tickets but they don't get answers even tho some of the posts are pretty old already. Does anyone know anything? =/

### Reply 2:
Why is the location going to be changed? This looked like it was prepared in 95% (<link> and I really wanted to attend (I've sent an email about the tickets a few months ago but haven't received a response), Vienna is also closer to where I live now, I could drive by car. If you're still deciding about the location I can recommend a good venue in central Poland, PM me if you're interested.

Topic: Time to Decide: Are You an Investor or a Gambler?
### Original post:
That's right, right now, when the price of bitcoin is in such a big decline. If it were me, I'd buy it!

### Reply 1:
We have touch $40k today, a good indication that investors and traders are buying. We have like decline more than 50% in the last 7 days or so, but we should be glad to see the price growing again. If everything has settle down, then we should be seeing another leg up.As for buying in the ~$30k, of course, bitcoin is in a discount so why not take advantage of it, continue to accumulate and then HODL, nothing beats buying in a dip.

### Reply 2:
I'm not a gambler, I'm just an investor. And I'm more of a HODLer actually. I'd buy more if I didn't miss the opportunity when the price was $30k. But still I'm thinking of buying some more from this level, $40k.

Topic: Have a clear understanding of what DCA means
### Original post:
Hello! I'd like to seize this moment to offer my insights on the Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy, aiming to clarify its concept and its intended purpose for those who may still find it unclear.DCA involves consistently investing smaller, equal amounts over time, as opposed to making large, irregular crypto purchases. Think of it as making payments for a product in installments, at regular intervals, until the total is paid off. When you regularly invest in your preferred cryptocurrencies, you automatically accumulate more assets over time, regardless of market fluctuations. This can help you grow your holdings and potentially reduce your overall average cost during market dips. In contrast, a lump sum payment is a one-time investment, the opposite of DCA.Let's delve into how DCA operates:Imagine the current price of BTC is $20,000, and you're a high-earning individual looking to invest in this asset. If you make a lump sum investment, you would acquire one BTC at a cost of $20,000.However, with DCA, you spread that $20,000 across five equal $4,000 purchases, resulting in costs of $20,000/BTC, $15,000/BTC, $5,000/BTC, $5,000/BTC, and $25,000/BTC. This approach yields an average<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
You can technically do it like this and twist the strategy in whatever way you want, but the main purpose of DCA is to just buy an equal amount every time, to eliminate the <truncated> factor of markets. Changing the amounts every time kind of defeats the purpose of doing DCA.

### Reply 2:
These are nuances. What is classically called DCA, pure DCA, would be buying the same quantities at the same time intervals. If it is not so exact but we can buy more depending on the available money or we vary the intervals depending on the availability (and we buy an extra amount for example on the day we receive a bonus) it would already be a variant of DCA, which can have more volatility.With pure DCA in an asset that appreciates over the long term what we do is to dampen volatility and as we move away from the same intervals and equal amounts we risk having more volatility.

Topic: [Total privacy Bitcoin]: off grid Transactions LoRaWan/goTenna
### Original post:
Recently I have been reading news about Mnuchin willing to impose stricter regulations on Bitcoin:US Financial Crimes Watchdog Preparing Significant Crypto Rules, Warns Treasury Secretary MnuchinOr again, I read comments on the Wall Observer thread about what you need to run in case of a CoronaVirus Outbreak. Of course a Bitcoin full node. But how do you connect to the bitcoin network when you are off the grid because a global pandemic has destroyed the telecommunication infrastructure and/or the government controls every internet traffic? Or, in a more less dystopian scenario: how can you transact bitcoin in case of lack of cellular coverage? Well, there are a couple of solution for this: LoRaWan and goTenna. These are two similar solutions, but even if they share some common background they are profoundly different in implementation and philosopy approach. Let's have a look at those two solutions: Lora/LoRaWanIf we go to the official LoRaWwan website we obtain a lot of useful informations: (minor edits to ease readability) Researching a well written document, we understand mode: So LoRaWan is the software layer, while LoRa is underlying the hardware.A LoRaWan network is composed <rest of post truncated>

I didn't think to a GLOBAL issue affecting the internet, while writing the above statement, but rather to a regional, statewide blackout. In case of a global internet blackout, I think yes I do agree, it was something I read about years ago: many concurrent chains, some emergency protocol forks to make blocks move again due to very high difficulty due to lack (or segregation) of miners. Interesting, but out of scope here.

If that happens in Australia, Japan or the Uk you're just as f%^% Same for an evil gubbermint blockade, who are you going to send your bitcoins to and for what?Yeah, it's a nice solution, it's a good back-up in case something totally wrong happens but let's think how this works in realitySo, you have no cellular coverage, you have no internet and you decide to send some bitcoins to an <truncated> you're cut off from the world, you can't speak with people over the phone over the internet you can't order anything online, you don't even know the price of BTC. To whom and why would you send bitcoins during these times?In my opinion, those things are more useful when you forget to pay your ISP bill or some idiot has cut a tree and destroyed a few cables and poles.

Topic: Chinese rumor group caused big price drop of Bitcoin
### Original post:
We all saw the big price dropped 8 hours before in almost all Bitcoin Exchanges , etc. OKcoin, Huobi and Bitcoinstamp. The drop was triggered by the rumors which spread by a Chinese rumor group through Weibo, so that the People's Bank of China has banned all the Chinese banks accounts which rare elated to the Bitcoin Exchanges, including the third party companies, such as the agencies which offer deposit service to the Bitcoin Exchanges. The numbers of the rumor group dumped lots of bitcoins on the major exchange platform to make panic sell, it caused the price dropped rapidly. At the same time, they bought back more bitcoins on a lower price to make profits. Because of the high click rate on Weibo, this strategy worked effectively, and a lot of Bitcoiners lose. In my opinion, If we can hold the bitcoins longer until the price is up to $800(the data is according to the history bitcoin data, check it out!), the rumor group will not have that much money play, thanks to the Chinese government (limitation of deposit). Hold on Bitcoiners, we can make a new history this year!<link>

Chinese Bank issues Securities on a blockchain- Zheshang Bank, one of the largest privately held commercial banks in China, has completed an issuance of securities worth $66 million using its proprietary blockchain platform.This is one of the first times ever that a financial institution issued Securites over a blockchain.<link>

### Reply 1:
if blockchain usage is increasingly expanded and there are more and more banks are issuing securities on the blockchain will result in an increasing price of bitcoin?

Besides zheshang bank, in china JD also launched the JD blockchain. the second largest e-commerce in China, recently launched the JD Blockchain Open Platform, a <truncated> platform that helps companies develop their own blockchain-based applications. Blockchain is a decentralized data book that is spread in various locations. The data is secured in an encrypted block, accessed through a peer-to-peer network. The first blockchain is a distributed ledger for bitcoin transactions, but this technology can also significantly improve the supply chain and financial records are easily traceable, tamper-proof transactions.

Topic: Bitcoin ""limitations"" (and high CPU usage for Mac client!)
### Original post:
I've been using Bitcoin for two weeks now, and I've ran across some serious limiations:1) Someone sends me money. It takes me 10 minutes to see it in my client, and even longer for it to get confirmed, since it has to wait for the next block.2) I cannot see who sent me money, in case I ask multiple persons to send me money to the same address.3) It took me MANY HOURS to download all the blocks.4) The Bitcoin Mac client takes 100% of my CPU (rather, one of my two cores) when doing nothing. I do NOT have generation turned on.These are the limitations I can think of at the moment. As such, how can Bitcoin possibly compete with other online banking solutions that are1) Instant.2) You can see who sent you money.3) You don't have to download hundreds of megabytes of data.4) No app takes 100% of your CPU.Given this: Why would any normal end-user move to Bitcoin? I know Bitcoin has many other advantages, but can we please stick to the issues I raised? Maybe my issues aren't issues, and merely current client limitations? What are your thoughts on these issues?

### Reply 1:
There isn't any way to see who sent you money because that is how bitcoin works. Creating a new address for each person and labeling it helps with this.The rest of the things you listed are client issues. An unconfirmed tx is as good as done for small amounts, and large amounts get confirmed much faster anyway.

### Reply 2:
hi, welcome to the forum.where do you check the 100 % cpu consumption on mac, please?i got mine a few weeks ago and still don't know many basic things1) as for the sending money, your client should infom you instantly as 0/unconfirmed that a transaction crediting your address entered the network. what we wait for is the block being mined that would save the sending confirmation permanently in the block chain (our shared transaction history)2) you can see from which address the payment comes. what you don't know is who controls that address. it's a good practice to use new address for each expected income. unless you publish a tipping jar for donationswhere you don't care.3) well, this software is still beta. you have no choice yet if to download the whole transaction history or only the lightweight (headers only) blockchain. this needs more time

Topic: Could Bitcoin's transparency be its downfall?
### Original post:
Serious question I am not anti Bitcoin do not get the wrong impression and I have grown a deep hatred for our fiat system that is exploitative and ill natured. When we compare Bitcoin to fiat there are a couple of differences which I think could impact us in the future: 1. Bitcoin's will become more tainted over time2. This pushes governments to become concerned and impose more KYC requirements3. Eventually most Bitcoin will be tainted to a degree. If we look at this research concluded by economist Rogoff[1]:34-39% in fiat currency is a huge of money. Bitcoin is further limited by its cap of 21 million which means that if Bitcoin becomes the mainstream currency used by everyone the share of tainted money would be higher because of the cap with fiat more money is printed in the fiat currency which reduces this amount. We already know that governments require anti-money laundering evidence for many transactions outside of cryptocurrencies such as buying a house requires proof that the money was earned legally and not through illegal activities. Exchanging money on exchanges requires identity which they probably look at your salary reported by the government. We have seen that in the <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
The argument is largely on whether Bitcoin is fungible or not. That is a perfectly valid concern and has been discussed thoroughly quite a while back at the height of MARA's censorship.IMO, the solution as I see it is precisely as what you've said, all of the Bitcoins will eventually have some degree of taint. The basis of this 'taint' is often quite unfounded, without any concrete proof that the current owner of the coins is in knowledge or have any connections with the prior owner. There will be a problem of trying to determine what threshold does a service intervene and report to the government. If this were to be too low, then most of the users would determine Bitcoin to be unusable, and resulting in the services being unable to operate at all. There will be significant pushback from the community and these regulated services in this case, and only serves to further push these services to operate off the regulations and underground. It would just be a tradeoff between how much you want to regulate or not; an over-stringent policy doesn't benefit any party in this case. Regulations are okay, it just means giving Bitcoin more legitimacy, and if people don't want to comply with th<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 2:
Excuse me, what happened to ""Verify, don't trust""?Bitcoin's transparency is one of the main points of Bitcoin. Which is why it already has something that fiat does not: Transparency. This does not mean no anonymity though. If you wanted to buy or obtain Bitcoins anonymously, you could do so. Easily. So don't doubt Bitcoin too much, as you might miss out on chances because you have started believing your own doubts. I am in full faith on Bitcoin. Basically because I know how it works and why its unstoppable. Feel free to try to prove Bitcoin wrong.

Topic: There Is No War Against Bitcoin! Stop The Fud!
### Original post:
I see many users talking about how USA government and Trump declared a war against Bitcoin! No, they didn't. Listen their message again! They declared a war against the criminals who are using bitcoin for illegal activities. A huge difference! This will be a good thing in the longterm. So stop spreading this fud cuz of wrong interpretation. Many big players already know that dollar is dying. They know that dollar can't survive for a long time. As the dollar collapses in the near or middterm future, bitcoin will rise and rise enormously. They know that. They also know that the trigger for all of this could be the next major financial crisis where a lot of funds will go to gold and bitcoin. But because bitcoin is a low marketcap compared to gold, it will rise much more than gold. They know that and they will try to regulate it but they cannot stop it. They (USA Congress) already admited that bitcoin is unstoppable. No one can stop it. If you can't win them, join them. So eventually everyone will join bitcoin in the future.

### Reply 1:
I can agree that people in crypto are easily triggered and by default declare governments and banks to be an enemy, and that while they have no clue about why they dislike them other than following the herd that has no clue either.Governments for a long time ignored Bitcoin because they thought it would implode and lose all its value, but a decade later it's still here. I got the feeling that because of Libra they have started to take Bitcoin more serious.As far as stopping the fud goes, it's impossible to do with how there are entire armies of bots automatically sharing news. News outlets wont stop with fud articles either because they attract a lot of clicks and therefore an important income stream.

### Reply 2:
There's a big difference by reading only the title than to the whole article, people just don't know how to read maybe or really have no time to understand the article but have more time to create FUD in cryptomarket. We should keep telling people not to panic, and educate them as much as possible for us to see a better market.

I agree with you, the cost of purchasing 1 BTC deterred me for such a very long time, because of this I never did test/ or start too understand this technology and I regret it. When I read anything about Bitcoin or saw stuff about it in IRC, I always thought you could only purchase Coins in whole Units, this stopped me from buying any BTC because they were at 150+ dollars and that was a big investment for me too lose at the time. It was not until a friend got me to mine some Primecoin and a mess of other alts did I start to begin understanding the possibility of the Bitcoin protocol.

Forget the media BS and what Warren Buffet thinks and what Bill Gates thinks Bitcoin inevitably will be the Noah's Ark financially for those who can see what's coming.Fact, the U.S. dollar WILL collapse in the next year or two. As Bitcoin becomes easy to move fiat to Bitcoin through various ways online what we will inevitably see as well as a rise in Gold etc we will see a scramble online into Bitcoin. I'm telling you unless another crypto rises in profile above bitcoin then it will be the recipient of online bank runs all over the western and possibly eastern world. Im now convinced that there is a certain providence about Bitcoin. I Would go as far as say even a few Bitcoin held through this period will secure the financial future of yourself and your children.

The petrodollar is rapidly declining, plus Europe is looking more and more like its gong to blow up with banking contagion that will go global. We don't know the timing it could be years or months but I'm convinced it's about the most obvious way to become wealthy I can think of. Buy some Bitcoins and simply forget about them for a few years.

Topic: ""Address Neutrality""
### Original post:
I would like to suggest a positive term for the efforts to stop blacklisting, redlisting, etc. of Bitcoin addresses.I therefore would coin the term ""Address Neutrality"" (similar to Network Neutrality for the Internet).I support Address Neutrality. I do not discriminate Bitcoins by the addresses I receive them from.

I envision our very own BitSquirrel logo holding a Bitcoin with the caption Start Using Bitcoin!. I opted for the word ""Using"" in lieu of ""Seeing"" or ""Hearing"" for obvious reasons.

Topic: Game with btc
### Original post:
Hello everyone,I would like to ask you if u already heared about a game called diablo or diabolo which allowed you to win btc around 2010, I can't find it anymore. The value of btc was 0.01 and when you win for 10$ you can withdraw the money. I stop playing when I was near to the 10$.. I had too much btc but I can't find it and I need it to resolve some family stuff. Thank you very much ! Allah bless you.

### Reply 1:
I know what you mean, and the bottom line is that we are already in 2022 when Bitcoin has surpassed its fantastic price several times. It's like the story where James Howells' 7,500 Bitcoin accidentally threw away a hard drive and tried to find it again. You played the game in 2010 doesn't mean it can actually come back to find it now.

### Reply 2:
Let's say you raised $8 at that time which equals 800BTC. Even if you can find a faucet site owner and want to claim, looking at current prices is too valuable to give up as a faucet gift years ago. I'm also not sure if the site owner still keeps that many faucet pools until this year.At the very least they can only give you $10 worth of bitcoins based on the current price.

Topic: Bitcoin is no Tulip
### Original post:
I think the time has come, where it is reasonable to suggest that Bitcoin was not the ""purely speculative bubble asset"" that many thought it was. There are many examples of ridiculous items which enter massive bubbles, pop, and then fall toward zero, never to recover. Tulip bulbs in the 17th century, or Beanie Babies in the 90's, are two popular examples. As Bitcoin prices rose wildly and then popped last summer, a non-imaginative person could understandably perceive it as nothing but Tulip Mania. A fair argument, if you didn't understand Bitcoin, I suppose. Bitcoin was a ""flash in the pan,"" a quick, scammy, interesting phenomenon that went away after the early adopters cashed out.But now, given a full picture of Bitcoin's history, its rise last summer, crash, and rise again this winter, I think comparing Bitcoins to Tulips is naive and unjustified. Bitcoin is not going anywhere, it seems - the core protocol has survived every attack and misfortune, and now the market value has also survived every attack and misfortune. The market knows these things are not worth zero, which is what many detractors have prescribed. There will be more bubbles, I am positive. How does a global market<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
I would assume every have-competent hacker on the planet has tried to steal coins or screw with the protocol in some way. There hasn't even been an ""outage"" of the system, let alone a serious problem. It's almost impossible to imagine that software could be so resilient, which is why I like the theory that Satoshi was actually an artificial intelligence network which created Bitcoin either as a gift to mankind or as a trick for future global domination.

### Reply 2:
Yes, I think it is fair to say we've bounced off the $2 bottom now and may be heading for the next bubble. Next time I hear someone trotting out the Ponzi scheme line, I'll reply, ""Ponzi schemes don't bounce.""

Topic: Coinbase is the reason why we have high fees
### Original post:
I've been saying for a long time that transactions to/from exchanges generate almost all Bitcoin's transaction traffic, so for now those centralized services have a huge responsibility to optimize their own transactions by implementing SegWit, optimizing their fee estimations and batching their withdrawals, which would significantly lower fees for their customers and the whole network in general. Here's a picture that supports my theory - it's clear that there's correlation between fees and trading volume.Now, recently Coinbase had a problem and they have turned off withdrawals for some time, and many people have noticed that this resulted in decrease of transactions traffic:<link> it is estimated that Coinbase creates 58% of all Bitcoin transactions today, and because they still don't use SegWit and don't batch transactions, their customers are paying ridiculously high fees, which also raises the fees for all users of the network. Many people, myself included, believe that Coinbase is maliciously attacking Bitcoin in order to boost altcoins like Bcash and Ethereum and centralize Bitcoin by pushing for bigger blocks.

### Reply 1:
I think we should give preference to exchangers that use SegWit or even stop using the biggest exchangers that do not change to SegWit.

### Reply 2:
Many other exchanges and services have successfully integrated SegWit months, so lack of native support from Core client is not an excuse. I'm the one who say it on reddit, and I don't see any problems with it, privacy is already pretty bad when you withdraw from centralized services, so reducing fees by 80% is a very good tradeoff. And I haven't seen anyone complaining about batching ever, so I don't know where are you getting that from. Meanwhile, the fees have dropped to 20sat/byte, because the trading volume is decreasing, but huge backlogs are going to happen again if companies won't fix their software.

Topic: Why this is the BTC most difficult time
### Original post:
There was no one ""cause"" for the Roman Empire to fall: it was a series of things.I'm not saying that BTC is an empire but I want to use the Roman Empire metaphor as an example of what we should expect if this ecosystem keep on battling and disputing this way.I think the major problem is that this world has no leadership whatsoever: without Satoshi no one here represents the role of the leader.Linux still works because of Linus Torvalds, you know that. The same goes for GNU that without his knight Stallman will be just a dream of the past.When there's no one in command civil wars start. And this is what I see in this community right now.So put together all this:no leadership;disputes among developers;pressure from the media and the economic world;no clear vision about the future and than you may see this is the recipe to go down.I do think this Bitcoin is an exceptional thing: I'm not a dev but a true romantic lover of this technology.Most of us in here share the same age.I remember in 2001 when I downloaded my first song with Napster: 45 minutes with an old 56K modem! And even if it was really expensive to use Internet at that time I didn't care to leave the client open to share it<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Techically Bitcoin is decentralized but its price is controlled by speculators which is also early adopters. If no one use Bitcoin anymore who do they sell their Bitcoins? Reaching a consensus will happen indisputably at the end.Bitcoin saw other hard times and this experiment is still going on. I don't see a dangerous situation right now.

### Reply 2:
""Leadership""? That means, to make Bitcoin centralized? This thread is not talking about mining difficulty.

With the imposition of crypto currencies a new reality on the international investment scene, the views of international investors varied among the supporters and opponents of the circulation of the most known digital currency ""bitcoin"" in the middle of the enthusiasm of digital investors to make a quick profit on the one hand and warnings And the fears of experts on the other hand about the bitcoin future trading that may not normally appear in traditional investments.In view of the movement of the bitcoin, from its inception until now fully aware that we face the possibility of bursting bubble price at any moment, and the reason for the lack of real value of this currency compared to currencies traded in dollars, there are assets behind the currency such as gold or minerals, material as a real estate sector in addition to the absence An organized governmental body for trading this currency.

Who knows. What we do know it's currently the most used and most popular cryptocurrency. In the future an improvement may be made on Bitcoin and we may see some other coin take it's place. But, at the moment there's no signs of this and Bitcoin is the leader by quite a bit. If something does replace Bitcoin as the most popular choice doesn't mean it will drop in price either.

Bitcoin has a very bright and very promising future investment, I believe bitcoin can be the money of the future in the world, and it is only against the time when it will happen.

Very bad for bitcoin but it does not mean it is the end of it. Bitcoin can recover even if China bans bitcoin. There are a lot of bitcoin holders, miners and traders outside of China. Japan is very supportive of cryptocurrency, it and other countries can uplift the lose from China.

### Original post:
Hi,Im new to trading, there are so many coins and I keep reading about bitcoin being unsustainable regarding energy it uses to mine and there are coins coming out with faster transactions time.If this is the case, Why is bitcoin considered the main one and its price not crashing from the threat of these other more equipped coins? Is bitcoin still able to develop and evolve and become energy sustainable and compete with faster transaction times if it is decentralized? No one is able to improve it?

### Reply 1:
Even though bitcoin is decentralized, are people still able to develop it and evolve it to compete with other crypto as time goes by?

### Reply 2:
One of the reasons that Bitcoin as a the first cryptocurrency becomes number one is its huge community. Because of this, i think, on the contrary, the other cryptocurrencies should compete the existence of bitcoin.

Topic: Still think bitcoin is coming to an end? Then you must read this <3
### Original post:
Lately, there seems lot of fearful reactions from the people about Bitcoin and how it could come to an end considering the current bear market. Literally media is taking it too seriously and showing the bitcoin as villain of the movie that too without any facts. If to date, any media really wants to understand in which direction the bitcoin is moving then they should really travel the world and understand how bitcoin is getting ""percolated"" in the world's tiniest systems and flourishing everywhere. ""My sole point of creating this thread is to send out positive vibe amongst the forum members, not to worry about the market situation because the picture is far bigger than what we think.""Starting with, Who accepts bitcoin? we can actually see the bitcoin's real use case and how it is already on the market just like other assets/currencies.

### Reply 1:
If they do not understand Bitcoin very well, then it's safer they do not invest in it at all. Creating a list to show the strength of Bitcoin is good, but anyone who cannot do a basic research to find out how the network operates and maybe zoom out of the chart to see previous oricae actions and reasons for them does not deserve to buy in at discounted prices. They would be back in a few months or years when the market is bulling and fomo in.Price actions are most likely not the result of market manipulation. It's a volatile commodity, so its value would remain speculative, at least for a few years.

### Reply 2:
It matters less which companies accept bitcoin; what matters more is how much payment volume Bitcoin payments are getting. Companies can easily revoke access to Bitcoin payments.

Forgive me if someone already posted about this, but I just found out about this. It looks like you follow their portal into amazon.com, give them your bitcoin address, and they send you a small percentage of the purchase price back to you in btc. Looks pretty cool, I'm going to try it next time I buy something on amazon. If anyone else tries it, let us know how it works out.

Topic: Idea: Diablo III Bitcoin Auction House
### Original post:
So Diablo III is up and running......and I found my first half decent item I don't have immediate use for. I just checked the gold auction house there are 2 items which come close.So I was about to make an auction for with a starting price similar to those.And guess what they charge a fee of 15%. Now that's a convenient way for them to decrease the inflation of ingame gold.Then I realized it is not that my item is so awesome it is that the auction house isn't really popular amoung the players.I just checked Ogrr too. Not really convenient there are no interesting offers either there (at least on the Europe realm)And before I do that I can just trade on <truncated> for other items or ingame gold.Using bitcoins just because isn't really an argument to use it. One thing that the ingame auction house is missing is any information on the popularity of the item, how many people already did bid there and it is impossible to tell if the item was bid at at all or if it is still at starting price.I'm not saying that this will be the killer app for bitcoin but it is one of those things I would really want to use it on, in a consistent way. Very soon Blizzard will enable some api (guess what i<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
I think this is one of the greatest ideas for BitCoin ever (besides my one ), but you should really change the title to say ""Diablo III Bitcoin Auction House"" or something, so people know to click on it I think you'll find MANY of the item farmers would jump on the chance to save 15% of their profits, all the while bypassing the <truncated> fees and hassles. Someone's gonna make a killing on this.

### Reply 2:
Granted it may take a while to gain traction and take off, but given proper support, ease of use, and fluidity, I believe people will be drawn to it, especially if you have advanced item search features and a strong community. You can also just spend your BTC on items you DO need, or spend them elsewhere on other real life goods. Converting to fiat will also be much cheaper than the fees bliz tacks on.EDIT: I bet you 21 million BitCoins the D3 eula has a clause against using 3rd party auction houses

Topic: bitcoin is the currency of the future? hahaha
### Original post:
Bitcoin was the virtual currency of IT geeks and hackers. After the bitcoins began to buy housekeepers, children, janitors, postmen and even my grandmother, they became impossible to use. High commission, today my friend wanted to pay the BTC through a token for a cup of coffee worth $ 5, he would have to pay a commission of $ 10. Anonymity? hahaha, any person knows where and on what wallet funds are transferred.The currency of the future does not have commissions and makes transfers instantly! Today I can say that BTC has no future if it does not solve its problems. Companies will switch to other, more modern currencies such as ""gram."" P.S Sorry, just I'm very angry right now because I can not make small transfers it's bullshit.

### Reply 1:
Not being useful for small transactions, doesn't necessarily mean that it hasn't got potential. It just doesn't suit your individual needs.It is useful in other situations though.

### Reply 2:
Perhaps BTC will be become gold in the future. it become a reserve and a barometer of wealth. The rest of the coins/tokens will served as currency.The price itself of btc is hard to become a common currency. But this things will not happen in our generation. besides we don't know about the future of btc it could just gone because of the new technology sprouted.

Ohhh I see, thank you. I didn't know that it wasn't Turing-complete. So I don't get why are they trying to add Smart Contracts, what are they trying to achieve? Like you said it's impossible to build d-apps, Script doesn't even have loops, so how could they be used?

In future, people can try to build up more derivative products and bridge things from Bitcoin network.It is future of multiple chain, cross chain, interoperable chain. Why do I think so? Because as human, we do love comfortable and convenient things. Such features satisfy our need.I would like to say with or without Smart contract or any derivative products built by crypto community, Bitcoin is our crypto King.

Topic: Bitcoins is on Yahoo frontpage - Brace for impact people.
### Original post:
The Bitcoin Triples Againby Jack HoughFriday, June 10, 2011The online currency has minted off-line millionaires. But for how long? The world's fastest-gaining currency has tripled in price again. Last week, SmartMoney reported that the Bitcoin had exploded from an exchange rate near zero to more than $10 in about a year, making it one of the top-returning assets of any kind. On Wednesday the currency topped $30.If returns like those seem otherworldly, perhaps its because Bitcoin is a world unto itself. To recap, it's is a purely online currency with no intrinsic value; its worth is based solely on the willingness of holders and merchants to accept it in trade. In that respect, it's not so different from fiat currencies like the dollar or Euro, but whereas governments back such money, Bitcoins lack central control.In another way, the appeal of the Bitcoin echoes the appeal of gold. Instead of a central bank, a computer algorithm dictates their supply. Today there are six million Bitcoins, a number that will grow at a steadily slowing rate until it approaches 21 million, but no more. As with gold, some see such limited supply as built-in protection against inflation that could result<rest of post truncated>

Topic: does wars will affect the cryptocurrency market?
### Original post:
can you if wars will affect the cryptocurrency market?

### Reply 1:
there are actually different theories. some say wars lead people to invest their money in valuables to try and save up any loss when their country's currency tanks. so they choose bitcoin as one of their options so it may lead to a huge bitcoin price rise.some say it won't affect it since people will be concerned about other stuff during a war. and even if the above is true, people will look for old stuff such as gold instead.

### Reply 2:
Depends on country. Every news affect this market if they are global. At the same time we have many ongoing wars in the world, many dont even aware of them.So it depends..

Even the blind can see that crypto Currency is making people millionaires all over the world just because they present the holders of such currency with the financial freedom and opportunity to accrue large amounts of wealth base on currency investment . But my question is that, is it late to buy bitcoin? Should i wait maybe bitcoin price will decline after 1st August meeting? Please i will welcome your advice so that I can make my decision on crypto currency investment.

### Reply 1:
try using the search, you will find at least a dozen topics with the same question. read the answers there and close this topic.what meeting?also 1st August is in 8-9 months from now!you shouldn't seed financial advice from random people on the internet.

### Reply 2:
Nobody here has a crystal ball to look into the future, so there are no guarantee that it would succeed or that it will fail. The predictions given here will mean nothing, and would only be driven by personal opinions and possibly hidden agendas to hype the technology. What we do have is historical data and based on that, we should succeed. ^smile^ Remember, Bitcoin and Crypto currencies are a high risk investment with the possibility for big profits.

I do not like paypal but need to use it. I do not like ebay but need to use it. Bitcoin interferes (or at least they think it does) with their business models. So I can see why and really don't even have a problem with them not using it. They do not allow google checkout and there are very few REAL reasons why google checkout would not be good for their customers.

Topic: Airgap wallet vs airgap pc
### Original post:
Hello,I would like to know how safe is the Airgap wallet if it is used on 2 devices. Basically 1 device its completely offline therefore acts as an airgap computer. Of course there still is bluetooth and wifi but from what I know its harder to insert a malware in a phone and also the phone will stay on airplane mode all the time. Now , I am not an expert and I don't know how really these things work that's why I ask you. Also can you tell me when you have to sign the transaction with the qr code is there any way the app can display the address you want to send but in fact the app is sending to another address? Or is there any way for a man in the middle to interfere with the app and steal the money even during the transaction or at any other time?A hardware wallet is not really an option for me as it can pe tampered and I also don't trust ledger security because I've heard people complaining about them.My second option would be an airgapped pc but I also heard there are ways to extract private key from that airgapped pc. Assuming that your airgapped pc was infected already with a malware it can send electromagnectic signals to an infected phone and steal that key. And I heard there<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Thanks for reply, Yes when I say 2 devices I mean 1 phone having the app Airgap vault which does have the private key. The other phone would have the Airgap Wallet installed which would send the transaction by QR code and then I sign it with the airgapped phone (airgap vault app).1. question here (maybe very stupid question for you but I cant find a logic answer in my mind): I downloaded the app and right after that I went in airplane mode . After being in Airplane mode I configured the Airgap Vault on the phone and received the 24 words seed phrase along with the recovery key and I also created my cryptocoins addresses. Now my questions is , since I ve done all of this completely offline how will the blockchain know about my address and private key? I don't understand how something that was created on an airgapped device completely out of the world can be a part of the blockchain which only exists online, I think . Now I am afraid to send the money to that address because I don't know if it should've been done while I was still online or the way I did it was the right way to do it.I want to mention that for security I reset the phone to factory and connected it to a safe network(a<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 2:
Blockchain doesn't have to know your address or anything. Addresses are not stored in the Blockchain and is just a derivation of your ECDSA public key, together with some additional information. You absolutely do not have to be online for this. Addresses are never ""registered"" with any central authority or stuff. In fact, when you're generating an address, you're just generating an ECDSA key pair on the secp256k1 curve which has a random 256bit number which is incredibly big. The probability of another individual generating the exact same key is astronomically low.I don't know about the app that you're using. I would never use a phone as an airgapped set up. Unless you sideload the application using APK or something similar with prior validation, there is a good chance that you've accidentally downloaded a malicious version of the intended app. I'm not sure what's the probability of this happening but I've seen plenty of those fake apps on Google Play recently.Hardware wallets are specifically designed to reduce such signatures and if you're paranoid about that, you have to use a hardware wallet. There is no way around it. As to whether the malware can copy information from the off<rest of post truncated>

Something could happen within their organization if it's a group ever since this bounty has been announced. It's a large sum of money as well that could sway the opinions of different members if they have one. I hope Twitter would get this resolved ASAP and make sure that it wouldn't happen again.

So, as some of you may know, I got into Bitcoins because of the USA poker shutdown. In the past few weeks, I've learned about them, and gotten an actual understanding of TOR, visited some of the darknet, etc. And it's really bothered me.A friend of mine and I were talking about Bitcoins. The first point he brought up was that the poker shutdown had nothing to do with poker. Poker sites ARE Bitcoins. I buy coke from you, and we just go play some head's up poker and I lose the required payment to you. Bam, Bitcoins. THAT'S why they got shut down. Certainly, they will eventually come after Bitcoins then. The potential for criminal activity associated with them is just too great.And that brings me to the second point my friend made. Ya Tor was anonymous and all, but at least the bad guys only had a meeting place. Now, with poker sites, and Bitcoins, they can MONETIZE their criminal activity. There are drug stores and assassin's for hire, and child predators openly discussion the best strategies for kidnapping children.

The automobile facilitated kidnappings and drive by shootings. The internet facilitated credid card fraud. Chemistry facilitated the holocaust.But try to see the bigger picture. They also bring huge societal benefits that far outweigh the detriments. If your aim is to stop criminals by denying yourself the technologies that might help them to commit crimes, you have to reject other technologies too, not just bitcoin. And don't forget that Bitcoin can also be used to combat crime.Sit back and enjoy the ride. See bitcoin for what it is - just a tool.The 21st century will be scary but wonderful.

Topic: Lost my bitcoins
### Original post:
Hi I bought 0.7 bitcoin from bitbargain then tried to send the coins to my bitcoin core wallet. I clicked on request payment in the software which generated an address which I sent the coins to but they have not showed up. I'm really stressed over this and I'm wondering if anyone can help. I sent BitBargain an email but they have not replied. What can I do here?

### Reply 1:
I didn't think about that (yet), but this is indeed the most obvious explanation... However, we can only make sure if the OP gives us the address that was generated by his bitcoin-qt wallet.

### Reply 2:
I think your bitcoin core client didn't synced completely as above friend said.. I downloaded bitcoin core last month. it took 6 days to synchorisation. and I delete that..don't worry. you'll get your money when your wallet sync completely done.

Topic: This is how Bitcoin price is manipulated
### Original post:
A very good solid write-up by David Gerard showing exactly how the bitcoin price is manipulated and people are cheated.If you do not want to read the whole piece this is the important part:When you buy normal securities or commodities, you assume that the trading environment is regulated sensibly, and that the exchanges keep to the rules set by law and, fundamentally, wont mess you around.You cant assume this at all in crypto trading. This is what unregulated means.The important thing about securities regulations is that every single one is there because someone ripped a lot of people off that way. They ensure market integrity. (One glaring example was the 2016 collapse of iGot in Australia, which hit a lot of small-time retail investors: I just assumed that since theyre in Australia there would be some sort of safety net or regulation or something like that bare minimum where he could be accountable for his actions.)There are various shenanigans that are banned on real securities exchanges for good reason, but are standard in crypto:wash trades where you trade with yourself, to pump the price up or down, or just create the illusion of trading volume. You could literally do this in<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Well said

### Reply 2:
If there is evidence of this type of behavior it is likely that either new ""Cleaner"" exchanges will emerge, or regulation will come into place to try and stamp it out. Unfortunately human nature being what it is certain people will try to cheat - but you can always trade outside of these exchanges with local parties. Bitcoin is after all a peer-to-peer currency.

Topic: yaBCSP - yet another block chain size post
### Original post:
Suppose (a post 0.8.0 Bitcoin release includes a block size adjustment that some consider undesirable and) a group of enthusiasts wish to more or less just stay with the old rules.Said group might consist of people who are attached to the thought of Bitcoin retaining a light weight and simple protocol character which might be perceived as the best way to protect against attacks, accidents, or undesirable mutation of one form or another.Said group may have the technical skills and financial resources to keep a light-weight system operational although certain kinds of 'cheats' may be required to thwart certain forms of superior resource attacks.My own conception is mostly just along the lines of having such a solution grind along in the background and be available if needed. It would be worth it to me (possibly) to earmark a certain fraction of my BTC stash to such an adventure, run transfer node(s) and probably even get into mining.Is there a no-bullshit, non-political conversation going on about the details of the general mechanics of how such a system might operate? How value in the pre-split block-chain value might be carried forward, what kinds of blow-back might need to be cons<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
First thing to do would be apply the merged-mining patches, as bitcoin is only equipped so far to be the primary chain in a merge, not one of the secondary chains.Then we could merge it alongside bitcoin0, namecoin, devcoin, groupcoin, i0coin, ixcoin, coiledcoin and, if it is true that the net can handle extremes, even geistgeld, which has 10 second blocktimes thus could let us send up to 60 megabytes per ten minutes to really see how many megabytes makes how much problems.60 times as many blocks per ten minutes is not quite exactly the same problems as one 60 megabyte block per ten minutes would be but still, if those who claim we can handle larger blocks cannot manage to run geistgeld credibly for any decent span of time maybe they will get an idea of the kind of problem larger blocks might present.Firing up geistgeld now, it is worse resource hog than i0coin so I had dropped it from my merge even before dropping i0coin. Anyone wanting faster confirms and oodles more transactions per ten minutes though really should run it to find out what higher resource consumption could really do. (We'd have to actually send non-empty blocks over it of course, but even empty ones it eats a lot<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 2:
oh i c.yes, it would be cool to know exactly how that would go down.... I hear talk of being able to spend the ""legacy coins"" on BOTH chains, call it 'valid double spending'. I have no idea if that's right. but if it is then their would be no reason to hold your ""legacy coins"", just simply send them to a new address on both chains.

Topic: 1BTC (69,000 loaves) ≠ 1BTC (20,000 loaves) if Bitcoin is a currency
### Original post:
I have commented on this in another thread but it seems to me that this deserves a dedicated thread specifically.When there are market downturns, and in bear markets like this one, the community repeats the mantra that 1BTC is 1BTC as a consolation.And I understand that it has its logic for someone who acquires Bitcoin and will HODL it for a long time, but not if we conceive it as a currency, as a P2P cash as Satoshi conceived it, because if it is a currency we are going to use it frequently, in the day to day to acquire goods and services. If it is a currency, the purchasing power has been reduced by 70% or more.If you acquire Bitcoin as an investment, and you are going to HODL it for a long time, I understand that you repeat the mantra that 1BTC is 1BTC.Tautologies are apparently evident true statements, but if we stop to analyze them, they have many nuances.For example: Poker Player is Poker Player. Do we agree with that? Surely we do. But is Poker Player when he was 7 years old the same as Poker Player when he is 70 years old? No way.

### Reply 1:
I had the same thought, without a supporting currency bitcoin can't be used as a currency. It is good as an investment, but it requires lot of support to be used as a currency. Even if bitcoin is valued in terms of Satoshi, every Satoshi will be valued in USD which is how it hold its value.Bitcoin can be used as a currency on daily basis if each and everything is priced in terms of bitcoin. This is tedious, because for a product that we pay with bitcoin might cost 0.01BTC, and the same when paid in USD will be lower or higher depending on bitcoin's price fluctuation. Here people wish to pay through which they can enjoy the lowest price for the particular product.

### Reply 2:
What is a currency? Anything that has value that is spent by people, but the value is not what that makes it a currency, it is the physical form it has. A dollar note is a currency but if changed to new type, the old note becomes useless. What is money? The intrinsic value of anything that people spend often makes it money. Is bitcoin a currency? Bitcoin is money, not having a physical form but a digital form that we heard about and that we use to know that it is of value, even if not called a currency, it can still be referred to as a <truncated> of currency: if it can be physical and digital currency, bitcoin being a currency will lead to another debate. You age does not change that you are a man. The amount of food you can buy with dollar or any fiat in the last ten years, you can not use the same amount of dollar or fiat to buy it this year, fiat value also decline.

Topic: BTC unconfirmed transactions exceed 500k on mempool
### Original post:
Hi everyoneright now we have 520k unconfirmed transactions on mempool with 1.9 GB capacitydo you think this may affect BTC usability especially for small transactions right nowyou need to pay 15% fees for 100$ transaction if the devs didnt ban those BRC tokenswe may even see fees exceed 100$ and we may reach millions of unconfirmed transactions in the future and only whales and miners will benifit

### Reply 1:
The current network is congested because of BRC-20 tokens. This is the reason why Bitcoin is walking away from its real goal. I tried a few days ago to make a Bitcoin payment where transaction fees became $17 to make a $50 transaction. So how will we make Bitcoin payments and use it as a payment method? Most likely now, stable coins would be popular payment methods instead of Bitcoin due to the high fees. We always blame Ethereum for high transaction fees, but lately Bitcoin transaction fees surpass Ethereum transaction fees. I hope developers will find a solution for that. Still, LN isn't very popular worldwide.

### Reply 2:
I think this post is a perfect fit for the ""Mempool Observer Topic"". We have talked about congested transactions and high Bitcoin fees a lot lately, so no need for another thread and to rehash everything all over again.

Topic: Why is Bitcoin beneficial to mankind?
### Original post:
I would assume everyone on this forum has a solid understanding regarding the benefits of a cryptocurrency to the financial world and the advancement of mankind. There are some obvious reasons for why using such a technology is practical for our evolving world and over the past 4 years there have been some great explanations as to the applications and uses of why Bitcoin and its successors could positively change the world economy. What I'd love is to start a conversation on this thread as to WHY do you personally think Bitcoin is so beneficial and in what instances have you seen it's implementation help or fix what is wrong with our financial system today? Like I said I realize there is plenty out there on the manner and I myself have a great understanding of it's greatness, but let's consolidate. What do YOU think?

### Reply 1:
It has the potential to weaken a large group of corrupt people.

### Reply 2:
I see it not just as an advancement of the financial system but economic/political systems as well.I see Bitcoin as a way to usher in a progression as significant as going from kingdoms to democracies.

What are some key companies, or what type of companies would you like to see adopt bitcoin? (I feel like companies that have a strong network and appeal to a younger audience are good for adoption, since general enthusiasts of bitcoin are younger people. Companies like Reddit, Zynga, Kickstarter come to mind)I'm hoping for the best in 2014thanks

### Reply 1:
I think they allow games that allow content purchases, and you can send gifts or something through FB. In other words, yes, there is a use case for FB- up to them if they see value in it.

### Reply 2:
I believe amazon already has its own coin.

Topic: Why google should endorse Bitcoins (and probably hates visa)
### Original post:
One of the most obvious reasons to purchase stuff with Bitcoins is that it's a free alternative to VISA.How much money are we talking about here?There is a lot of different costs. But one that I have seen is cirka 5%. Of the sold value.Propose the avarage margin for stuff sold on the internet is 30%. This will actually increase your revenue by 12%.Now to the google part. Making ads in google is essentially like bying visitors. The value of one of these visitors is ofcorse at least the value of the earnings of what an avarage visitor buys.This means, that if online merchants drop visa and start using bitcoins instead, it would make economical sense for them to increase the bidding on the ads aswell.How big is this market for google?2010 they had an adrevenue of 28billiion usd. An low estimate is that 10% av theese ads come from something that ends up with a visa-payment. 2.8 billion dollars. That means that this should increase the value of ads with 336 million dollars. So google (I know your AI:s are reading this) How about you bring us some of that sweet cash. We could take them in ad-coupons

### Reply 1:
google will do what is profitable for google to do.how are they going to make money off Bitcoin? i doubt they're going to become an <truncated> advantage' - i.e., hurting the competition - only gets you so far.

### Reply 2:
This is certainly too low - that's probably even below the fraction of active Bitcoin users worldwide!I guess by now I personally have told more than 0.001% of the population of my country about Bitcoin already

Topic: I would like to interview someone on my radio show
### Original post:
Is anyone here comfortable enough with this project to explain some things to my listening audience?We have an internet radio with over 8 million listeners at <truncated> and would love to talk about this cool effort.

### Reply 1:
Call the radio station at 310-928-7857 and speak with Todd Sheets. I am very sure we can open some time on several different shows, but I found you first so I want to interview you on the Harmony Health Hour!

### Reply 2:
I have to call BULLSHIT here for several reason. First, is that you dont have 8 million users as that would make you the largest single online radio station on the internet. Bullshit! Second, how can your radio station have 8 million listeners when your server peak is only 16 and only 1000 seats. Bullshit again! When I viewed you ShoutCast D.N.A.S. status page <link> you had zero listeners connected, while at the same time my stream had 6, and my daily peaks are greater than 16 listeners. This tells me my station might be larger and I know I dont have 8 million listeners. Third, Loudcity has a limit on the 'total listened hours' allowed and its 150,000 per month. Thats a far cry from supporting 8 million listeners unless they only listen for about a minute and them leave. Plus if you were that large Loudcity would ask you to leave as they have others that apportched the 150000 total listened hours allowed. Forth, terrestrial broadcasting can not be pair with services like Loudcity (from my understanding). Fifth, Kansas City has a population just over 2 million. Thats a far cry form 8 million. Sixth, the coup d'tat, <link> shows different phone number than you provided here. The 310<rest of post truncated>

Topic: Good news for bitcoin as G20 says no crackdown for cryptocurrencies
### Original post:
The G20 has announced good news for bitcoin ruling out the possibility of new regulations for cryptos by its regulator. Bitcoin bulls had a positive reaction to this report that saw prices recover tremendously.Full article: <link>

### Reply 1:
I sincere want to hope that this is from a reliable source. At least, everybody can now settle down and do his business as the fear, uncertainty and doubt have been cast into the ocean. Let's us begin to see the remarkable impact of this news in the prices.

### Reply 2:
One thing people have missed from this recommendation is that it is not a recommendation of no regulation. It just does not recommend creating new regulation specifically for cryptocurrency. There is a difference and a significant one. It just means traditional regulation will be used for cryptocurrency.

Topic: Alternatives Like BTC Becomes Necessary As World Debt Reaches $253 Trillion
### Original post:
Our debt-ridden world economy continues to stack up more IOUs. According to recent estimates, the global debt is now around $253 trillion or 322% of GDP a record high that Bitcoin is wagging its finger at.According to a new report, the world economy is based on more debt than ever before in fact, total world debt now comes out to over 3x global GDP.To read the full article, check it right hereIf you look at the numbers, it's already record-breaking for world debt.As Bitcoin continues to be recognized and massively adopted worldwide, I just don't know if it's indeed a genuine alternative because of the record-breaking world debt of $253 trillion.What would you think about this guys? Do you honestly think Bitcoin is gonna be the best alternative choice in this situation? I would like to hear more about your reactions or opinion on this one. Cheers!

### Reply 1:
BTC as alternative, of course. Its the only thing that's valuable that also fits for the technology we have today. We have phones and wireless networks that is perfect for digital currencies. Governments can even take BTC as reserve if they can just accept the fact that it makes more sense to use it than gold.

### Reply 2:
Bitcoin is definitely more transparent in that regard. Gold however will be bought up regardless of how much of it is dug up, simply because central banks are champion in abusing the money printer. In the long run, it eats through the available supply and that will definitely reflect in the price, but that process could take decades. As much as I like Bitcoin, I don't see it being a solution to the problem OP is referring to. If you don't deal with the monetary policy markers, nothing will change, ever. It's the same group of like-minded elite that's in charge. Something has to change there on a fundmental level. I do not see that happen with how much empirical evidence we have today.

Topic: If BTC Dominance will drop to 40%, what will happen?
### Original post:
I noticed that if BTC has a big dominant rate the entire crypto is bad, in short it looks bullish. Though the rate now is very consistent to 50% and above, what do you think will happen to the market if it will drop that low. Will this gives a bad or good effect to BTC and Altcoins?

### Reply 1:
The marketcap is the only basis when I tried to analyze things, I'm really as good as other traders who very smart with their TA.I noticed that during the bull run, the marketcap showed BTC dominance of only 40% or over and the market really looks good at that point. So, in case it will drop again, it should mean a good price for every coins.Note : during the last bull run, even shitcoins made a rally also, so it could happen again IMO.

### Reply 2:
When there is drop in the dominance of bitcoin, in one way or other some other altcoins is getting its increase in the dominance level. This is a form of loss in strength, automatically there'll be some impact on the price if such scenario exist. When ethereum dominance increased nearing to bitcoin the growth was tremendous with ethereum.

Topic: Consensus Mechanism - A Proposal Idea
### Original post:
In trying to figure out how to arrive at consensus on decisions like protocol changes such as the Block Size issue, it is necessary (i believe) to come up with a way to do so that involves the bitcoin users and not just the miners.We need the ability to vote on our favored BIP and we need more than just a majority vote, we need a way to arrive at consensus. The problem with arriving at consensus is the existence of trolls and contrarions that just want to disrupt the process. I have a few keys that I think are required to arrive at consensus which are:1) The Ability to Change Your Mind (change your vote)2) The Ability to Vote For Multiple Proposals3) A Mechanism That Rewards Consensus and Punishes DisagreementThere are multiple services which allow Bitcoin holders to vote such as crypto voter, coin-vote, bit congress, etc. All we would need is a BIP to peg part of it's deployment mechanism not only to miner vote consensus but also coin vote consensus. say 75% for a single BIPThis could only be possible if voters could change their mind and change their votes according to new information and argumentation, and also according to revisions of the BIPs themselves.And if there were a wa<rest of post truncated>

to be honest.. its exchanges and payment gateways that hold the most weight..afterall if coinbase, bitfinex, bitstamp, localbitcoins, and ofcourse bitpay(processing 100k retailers) all decided to go one way.. then people will instantly find that funds are not being recognised if they users chose another fork..thus users would panic and change forks just so that the payment gateways will accept their money..its like real life.. if a shop decided to no longer accept bank notes.. people would panic and get angry but eventually they would take out their debit card..the belief that people would try boycotting such stores would only work if there were a direct alternative retailer accepting the user preferred payment for the same product/service, otherwise customers adapt out of need for the product/service.and it only takes 5 key corporations to sway the masses

Perhaps 90% is the better threshold level.

All bitcoin money I earned from my freelance services is save from blockchain.info. Are web wallets safe? I tried Bitcore but it says it will took 7days to download the blockchain and its so huge. It will fill my harddrive.May I know how do you backup your bitcoins? Can you save it from your emails? Google Drive, Dropbox? Thanks,

Make a paper wallet that isn't so obvious with a QR code private key, and laminate it or something. Send your cold storage coins to that address. Scan the QR code to import when you want to send.

### Reply 2:
Use a paper wallet, I posted a step-by-step guide here:<link> multiple copies if you want the extra insurance against loss or destruction.Never upload your keys to any web hosting service.Use paper wallets as ""cold-storage"", store ~50 mBTC in each one.Use electrum or Mycellium as a ""hot-wallet"", break open a paper wallet when the balance is running low.You can use paper wallets directly to receive payment, I am currently doing this with the address next to my avatar.

### Original post:
...and the ""Bitcoin Accepted Here"" sticker isn't there anymore. How sad, I came all that way to eat and pay with Bitcoin!It seemed they might have accepted if I pushed them to accept it, part of why they seemed hesitant was that it seemed difficult and cumbersome to them. They still had a full piece of laminated paper with a QR code of their Bitcoin address... but my take on it was the owner wasn't there, and the guy working there was reluctant to deal with processing a Bitcoin transaction and seemed to know nothing more about Bitcoin than the QR code.Would have been nice if they had Bit-Pay, and have a bitcoin transaction pop up on all their mobile phones at the same time, denominated in dollars, so someone with no clue or interest in BTC could still accept them no matter who was working.An electronic transaction wouldn't have worked for me anyway since the only BTC I had ready access to were Casascius Coins. I was carrying two 5BTC bitnickels, four 1BTC coins, and a 25BTC coin. The guy there seemed like he had never seen them before, I was very sad he wasn't eager to feed me for them.

Topic: Bitcoin and the future uncertainty
### Original post:
Is there a situation where we woke up one day and found out all our bitcoins vanished? Blockchain or DLT has a simple definition where it is designed to solve double spending problem which represent a unique transaction that are solve through the computers in a network. Blockchain is in fact considered as a collection of transactions in a block that is store in a peer to peer basis and each of its block is linked with the SHA-256 algorithm, timestamp network to solve the double-spending problem.This principle also introduced the reality of immutable transaction feature to the computing world. So, having understand such definition, is our believed that this would be immutable as it claims or anyone has proven that such immutable resistance is exist as of today ?

Topic: What metrics do we want to extract from the Bitcoin transaction graph?
### Original post:
For the purpose of researching the Quantitative Analysis of the Full Bitcoin Transaction Graph paper, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron have parsed the blockchain data, put it in a query-friendly database and built some tools to analyze it.The particular metrics they have so far chosen to extract from this data, and their interpretation of them, have been the subject of some criticism. However, now that they have this infrastructure for analysis, they would like to leverage it to analyze more useful metrics.They are asking the Bitcoin community - what information do you want to try to extract from the transaction graph?

### Reply 1:
Blockchain-based provably fair gambling sites like SatoshiDICE use a publicly known address for each wager and for each payout. This causes them to be good candidates for use in study.I'm not sure what information it might yield. Since individual wagers there frequently are in the 100 to 250 BTC range (i.e., $1,200 to $3,000 USD for a single bet) it would be interesting to know if somehow this service is being used as a low cost mixing service. While this doesn't remove traceability, it does change the composition of a wallet. So taking coins that are tainted and sending the coins through SatoshiDICE is something that costs 1.9% per pass but it cuts the level of original taint by 50%(statistically, over the long run). Of course, this is a flawed approach for mixing because the winnings returned would assume the same level of taint that the coins used in the wagering (i.e., a tainted coin taints every other coin in a SatoshiDICE payout) had. But the tools that report taint probably aren't sophisticated enough to take this characteristic of SatoshiDICE payouts into account and thus report low levels of taint after being passed through SatoshiDICE.I don't know how you could identify w<rest of post truncated>

Topic: Is bitcoin a white/asian thing?

I wonder cause I don't see much darkies involved in bitcoin, most people who seem involved ATM are either white europeans and americans and eastern asians.so why are other races not involved in bitcoin? is it cultural? or they just don't care?

### Reply 1:
Just look at bitcoin conferences, just look at famous people in the bitcoin community, I only see whites and some asians.I know there are some dark coloured people in bitcoin but they are a very small minority yet america's black population is 15% and I saw no black in any kind of bitcoin conference.all I see is asians from china, japan, south korea, singapore and such and whites from europe, north america and south america who are into bitcoins mostly that's a FACTyet nothing prevents other races to get on the bitcoin bandwagon and I find this strange

### Reply 2:
this thread is going to turn into a clone of the ""why are there no women in the community""i am now both laughing and yawning at the fact that there are many people of different skin colour and gender in the community.so whats next, hire a black guy to walk around the conferences, just to have the ""token black guy"" that movies like to have, simply to show their ethically diverse... stepping back to the topic question..there are people of every skin colour, go check out the african bitcoin meet-ups. the detroit, alabama, brooklyn, meetups. basically any place where you think black people hang out to, like their media produced stereo type hang outs, and there you will find what you are looking for. if you are yourself black and you feel that your skin colour is not represented by the community. then tke these two points onboard1. you dont need representation in bitcoin, its faceless.2. if you want representation, represent yourself.bitcoin is not about gender or colour. its about money.. we all want it, we all need to use it. only government statisticians care about gender and colour, and we are not the government.oh and ill just leave you with these little gems<link>

Topic: TX Fees. Impossible to work out what is acceptable?
### Original post:
Hey guys,I understand that TX fees are part of the BTC universe and that's all good, but I've run into a few issues the past few days and I just don't know how to move forward.I use Multibit HD as my BTC wallet and it lets you select the fee per byte with a slider, but this doesn't always work.For example :TX #1 - 0.2 BTC / 140000 fee - first confirmation in less than 5 minutes - great TX #2 (sent about 15 minutes after the #1) - 0.2 BTC / 140000 fee - took over 36 hours to get the first confirmation - wtf?Then today I sent a much smaller one :0.019 BTC / 180000 fee (just to be safe after what happened before) - 12 hours later still no confirmations???Is this an issue with Multibit or am I just being super unlucky here?I also read that if you have a lot of dust payments (cloud mining payments in my case - I know don't start, I learned the hard way) coming into your wallet this can end up costing you a lot more in fees when you try to send it as a single bigger amount. That's fine but how on Earth am I ever supposed to account for that when setting a TX fee? e.g : If I have say 5 x 0.1 BTC payments and a hundred 0.001 payments in my wallet and then try to send 0.2 BTC how do I know <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Thanks for the reply Holliday.I was using the first site you mentioned when calculating my fees, but I'm not sure MultiBit is labelled correctly.It's says select a TX fee per byte, which I did, but it doesn't show me how many bytes the TX is going to be?Then when I view the TX on the BC it seems to have used my ""fee per byte"" as the total fee, but, and this is the weird part, not always. The one that took 36hrs (TX #2 above) said the fee was a total of $11.34 so what's going on there?Maybe I should just jog on this wallet once and for all :/

### Reply 2:
Any decent wallet is going to let you choose your fee based on the size of the transaction (which is what matters, because block chain space is valuable).Find a website which provides information on transactions in recent blocks.<link> (click Fee - btc/kB - within n blocks)Then choose a fee based on the size of your transaction and how soon you would like it to confirm.Simple.

The majority of the investors and traders have misconception on investments because they think that they will easily become successful by putting their hard earned money in bitcoin and other assets without understanding that it is just the foundation and they need to work really hard and follow the other steps to beat the market and able to have gains in their portfolio. Don't get me wrong guys because I really promote investing but majority do not understand how it works, they think that there will be a guaranteed profits oncethey put their hard earned money but in reality, it is very harsh because outcome is not guarantee which means that there are thousands of outcome that can happen and what we need to do is to be prepared on what ever situation will be. So what are the outcome? they incur losses. They do not understand the risks associated with the asset and if the rewards are worth it or not.

It is the number 1 reason why investing doesn't guarantee you to be rich.So the question is how <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
It is only a naive person that thinks this way. Or maybe someone who is overly optimistic and has a disillusion about how reality works. And people in this category shouldn't even think about investing in bitcoin or in anything for that matter until they get the proper a perspective. I would write that we should invest in knowledge and invest in experience. Go to an older more experienced and successful person and humbly request that they take you under their wings and mentor you. They should acts as role models whose footsteps you should follow. You should sit with them during investment meetings, you should go with them conferences, you should observe them and ask intelligent questions. That's investing in knowledge and in experience.

### Reply 2:
It's hard for newbies to trust themselves in this market.They might trust themselves at beginning but when they read news, fud, see price crash, their confidence will vanish quickly. They don't have enough experience to know that volatility is for short term and long term price will have less volatility up or down. It has very sharp growth since 2009 till 2023 with many big volatile price movements in those years.They must live in this market and with time they gain experience which is important for them to trust themselves.

Topic: Bitcoin Forks - New Day New Fork
### Original post:
Hi,I am relatively new to crypto world. But lately, as many of you may have seen and experienced. The BTC and its derivatives are undergoing forks after forks. I understand various changes are being made as forks go through. But as a really small holding of BTC in electrum.I see a list of new fork coming: Bitcoin Diamond (already forked)?BTC Twitter:Upcoming #Bitcoin Hard Forks:Super Bitcoin (498888 block)Bitcoin Platinum (500000 block)Bitcoin Uranium (unknown)Bitcoin Cash Plus (501407 block)Bitcoin Silver (TBD) $BTCEvery time new coin comes out, the guides to claim forked coin is to move your initial holding to new wallet. Then use wallets like coinomi to transfer the old wallet key to claim forked coin. I am trying to determine how do others keep claiming their newly forked coins? Do people usually create new wallet as these forks come by? I already created third wallet from BTC to BCH and BTG. Every time I move coins, I loose my BTC holding size (making my tiny holding micro). Help!!!!

### Reply 1:
Perfect answer, I also believe most of the Exchanges will just ignore these clingons and Ive read a piece somewhere that that the Lightning Network will eliminate a lot of these mini forks.

Topic: How to Find Identity of Satoshi
### Original post:
I personally have a very strong theory on the identity of the creator of Bitcoin. I have chosen not to speculate on this for personal reasons. I believe his legacy would be better served if I did not choose to reveal the links.Does anyone here share the same sentiment. If you found information linking Satoshi to a certain individual would you release the information and your conclusions?I will not share the identity but I will share the way I went about my research. The best method to finding Satoshi is not by looking into those most closely linked to the creation of Bitcoin but instead looking at those who were not involved but you speculate they should have been.You will find a certain person inconspicuously absent from the creation and development that without a doubt would have been.

### Reply 1:
It is impossible to know who he is. If he hasn't told it yet, it is because he has his reasons.

### Reply 2:
Dang it. You found me.

Topic: Google prohibits advertising Bitcoin. What will happen to Bitcoin?
### Original post:
The largest search engine on the planet, Google, announced formally it will restrict advertisement of Cryptocurrencies and related content (including but not limited to initial coin offerings, cryptocurrency exchanges, cryptocurrency wallets, and cryptocurrency trading advice), including aggregators and affiliates regarding cryptocurrencies and related content.The article itself completely: <truncated> do you think will happen to Bitcoin and his price?

### Reply 1:
This is exactly the kind of FUD, coupled with that Singaporean exchange FUD, that pushes the price lower... Ugh why do they do this?But Okay, I read the article, and your post is misleading. Your post is more FUD than the article LOL.Google is not banning Crypto ads.Here's what's happening:In JUNE 2018, Google will ban crypto ads from companies / ICOs that are not certified by the various legal standards of the countries involved + Google's own internal review.What does that mean? They're trying to cut down on the scams. Crypto ads include crypto gurus and lots of weird financial advice from crypto experts who aren't certified. Google is trying to cover its legal ass by requiring certification because more mainstream people are getting scammed via Google Ads.This is actually good news! It means crypto is becoming so big that Google is taking notice and more people are being affected.I believe this change is good. Now we'll have cleaner crypto ads, and less people will be scammed via Google Ads. This way crypto can have a better reputation, overall as there will only be legit crypto ads starting in June!

### Reply 2:
It is because of the large number of fake ICOs and scammers that google decided to ban all the cryptocurrency ads. It did take a hit on the market as the price of btc and other coins fell by almost 8% today.But, the ban is only for those coins which aren't certified by legal standards. So, the market will recover back eventually.In future, we can expect better quality of crypto ads and might actually work in favor of the market.

Topic: Gold-plated Bitcoin bearer bar
### Original post:
This is a product I am bringing to the Bitcoin market. It should be available in a few weeks.Like the 25 btc Physical Bitcoins, these are gold plated bars that are made to look valuable. A great way to dress your Bitcoins for what they're worth, and a way for Grandma to hold bitcoins that's easy to understand and requires no technical knowledge.I'm planning on offering them in two versions:1 - a 100 BTC bar with a hologram, which works just like a Casascius physical bitcoin. The hologram itself will be specific to this product and will say Casascius 100 BTC directly on it.2 - a non-denominated savings bar with a hologram. You buy your own, and load your own BTC. The hologram itself will be a Casascius hologram with a valid private key and the hologram says zero BTC, which is mainly a clue that one should check the balance before accepting the bar in a face-to-face transaction. This is mainly to cater to those who want a good-looking bar, but don't want to send 100 BTC or more through the mail, or who might want it for a different denomination. I may have the ability to laser-etch other denominations into the bar, but that remains to be seen.I'm interested in feedback and thoughts.T<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
This is actually one of the most compelling reasons I thought the bar would be useful. Even the 25 BTC gold-plated coins are definite eye catchers. I felt inclined to clearly put ""gold plated"" on the bar, otherwise, people would be inclined to think it was solid gold and might ignore the bitcoins.Even worse in an estate scenario would be a USB flash drive that contained the bitcoins along with a 2-page step-by-step on how to use TrueCrypt to decrypt it. I don't know about your family, but my family would have enough to worry about besides learning how to decrypt my bitcoins that they could pretty much be kissed goodbye if that were how I was keeping them.

### Reply 2:
A tip for improvement:- made the bar from tungsten- remove the ""plated"" from the label

Topic: How bitcoin is fueling Tesla with Elon Musk $1b in profit

How Elon Musk is staying rich with BitcoinSo, its now clear how the Elon Musk became the world richest man by not focusing on the sales of electric calls a lone but then looking for opportunities in the crypto field #bitcoin. The rest of the world businesses has been definitive and focused on investment through a single investment platform which has become an established field already with limiting profit on their capital investment. Musk is way above that, as he is futuristic about his plans, taking into consideration the problems of the world, exploit its crannies in order to profound solution. What an opportunist should do.First its the problem of fussil fuel and emissions resulting to a global warming and climate change of which the electric calls have come in to resolve and hes already the richest man in the world with yet his electric calls to be widely used around the globe and just now, hes spotted another underlying opportunity in bitcoin.Tracking and UtIlizing opportunitiesThe world has been about a global currency not tied to boundaries and operating a cashless policy and to our amazement, Musk has been able to make $1 billion from his capital investment of $1.5 billion <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Quite a common misconception: Elon Musk doesn't own the $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin, because it was bought through Tesla's balance sheet, not necessarily Elon's bank money. Also taking note that Elon Musk only owns a chunk of Tesla, and not 100% of it because it's a public company where people worldwide invest in it.

### Reply 2:
Elon musk been the CEO of Tesla although not a 100% stake holder of the company has the entitlement of assigning the networth of Tesla to his name although he might not have the legal right to make person transactions with the assets but still have that benefit of assigning the companies net worth to his name

The journey of bitcoin from 2009 to 2017 is very interesting. Although the stories of <truncated> are very interesting and motivational that how they initiated and what problems they faced at earlier stages.In 2017 the number of businesses accepting bitcoin continues to increase. Where you see the bitcoin in 2018?

### Reply 1:
Well if we don't get some big hubs for Lighting Network around bitcoin itself, for me personally I think that many bussinesses will try to put in altcoins as payment that they accept one of these being bitpay which is currently looking to implement altcoins. But looking at it now there are some preatty good indicators.Since this year there were a lot of All Time Highs which ment that mainstream media wrote about bitcoin time to time, so when people start to think about whats so special and because of its price when people start to get puzzeled they will want to investigate more. Which means that there might be wider adoption. In my opinion goverments will play the keyrole in this because many people will like it to be regulated because then they will feel safe using crypto currencies in general.

### Reply 2:
My expectations are very positive. In the year 2017 what most caught the attention in bitcoin was its price (this is my opinion). For 2018, I believe that we will have great news about the acceptance and confidence of the users, I do not believe that the price will fall, on the contrary, will rise, but not equal the last increases.

Topic: Two months since Tesla BTC purchase. Corporate buying less than expected?
### Original post:
We remember that day when the news came out. BTC shot up from $38K to 44K and to 48K the day after. People expected an avalanche of big companies to buy BTC. So far it hasn't happened yet it seems. We have seen news about some companies around the world buying crypto but they were not ""big"" big players like Tesla. Do you think corporate buying so far was not as big as we expected when Tesla made the news?

### Reply 1:
After Tesla bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin, the price of bitcoin increased to over $50000 after some days, Microstrategy bought $1 worth of bitcoin at the time with the price slightly above $50000. Although, Microstrategy has been buying bitcoin before, but saying big companies are not buying bitcoin after Tesla bought bitcoin is very wrong.Grayscale also open investment for investors. That is another big company in the crypto community, Grayscale bitcoin holding has increase to over $38 billion recently. There are many other institutions that have been investing in bitcoin, it is just a matter of time, more big companies will join and invest once the creteria before investing in bitcoin is fulfilled, this can be more increase in marketcap. Bitcoin is the digital gold, it will not be surprising to see bitcoin marketcap getting to 5 trillion in a decade to come, or before. What is most important is that bitcoin is deflationary, and this makes people becoming to prefer it than other assets also because it has limited supply of 21 million which makes it appreciative in design.

### Reply 2:
My thread is about big names expected to come into the BTC world as investors.BTW the majority of talk in this forum section is about the same thing (future of BTC/ BTC price) if you haven't noticed.

The hearings, publications, and opinions on Bitcoin from multiple different governments in 2013 is interesting as well.

BTCisthefuture I highly appreciate for the interesting topic you have initiated. Yes for sure 2013 has been a big year for crypto-currency especially bitcoins. Bitcoins has flourished this year immensely and I believe it shall resume to sky rocket after tackling few hurdles in its way. Yeah I also need to see what people have to share with us about bitcoins.

Topic: PayPal finally allowed BTC
### Original post:
So, here we go..""The shift to digital forms of currencies is inevitable, bringing with it clear advantages in terms of financial inclusion and access; efficiency, speed and resilience of the payments system; and the ability for governments to disburse funds to citizens quickly."" -- Dan Schulman, CEO of PaypalThe cult of bitcoin makes many claims that its instant, free, scalable, efficient, secure, globally accepted and useful it is none of those things, -- Bill Harris, Ex-CEO of Paypal""Paypal announced the launch of a new service enabling its customers to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrency directly from their PayPal account, and signaled its plans to significantly increase cryptocurrency's utility by making it available as a funding source for purchases at its 26 million merchants worldwide."" -- SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct. 21, 2020Honestly say, many people are being sceptical with this knowing how strictly PayPal freezes its users' accounts for little reason. I don't know if they will treat crypto accounts differently or not, but imagine getting your accounts frozen for 6 months before they decide to give them back to you or not. Another thing is what will be the fees? $15 for a $1000 tr<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
I live in a country where PayPal is not really necessary. Because of that reason, we do not often use PayPal unless we have some business with foreign clients, mostly US citizen. This news might affect the price of bitcoin since many US citizens are using bitcoin, including big companies. What are the fees you talk about? It is a mining fee or is it a service fee? Do we have a bitcoin address in our PayPal account?Freezing accounts appears a lot in my country. Dont know why. Maybe people do not provide enough identity and involve in shady activities.

### Reply 2:
It's only for US citizens for now, and buying through PayPal was already allowed in US. So it's not such a big news, and the initial big news had triggered quite a rise already.Maybe when this will be allowed worldwide, maybe then the market will have a bigger reaction, but I don't know...I don't use PayPal much either. I guess it depends where people buy from. I needed it less than 5 times in the last 10 years.

### Original post:
The popular TV series ""Grey's Anatomy"" latest episode features at the start a hacker hacking live and messaging live to a hospital the hacker has taken over. The hacker wants 5000btc to give the hospital back control. Very interesting stuff. I bet there going to be so many foolish people who will be blaming Bitcoin....

Well the fact is that that sort of thing isn't as good for gaining viewers. Making btc evil gets more viewers. The people that watch and believe btc is evil are the worse kind because they actively watch and give attention to nonsense. They entertain the nonsense and feed it. If it we're not for these clueless people such news would never exist. When I saw it on the I just though. ""Oh boy here we go"". xD

Oh god exactly what we needed more accusations of BTC only being criminal . Can the mainstream show the other side of bitcoin for once?

Topic: Help Pls!   Large number of unspent outputs / Consolidate some outputs message
### Original post:
Hi guys,my first post so hopefully I'm in the right place, in need of some urgent advice. I run an online business that only takes payment via bitcoin. How that works is users pay via a gateway merchant processor who then forward all deposits on to my bitcoin address. So far there have been 419 deposits made to my wallet. Now each time I login I see the message ''this wallet has a very large number of unspent outputs. please consolidate some outputs'' and what's more worrying is it says ''Use total available minus fee: 3.53393707! This is crazy high, any way I can reduce this? How do I go about consolidating outputs? Thanks in advance

### Reply 1:
Man, i have this exact problem. I have a lot of small $ amounts of transactions... I cant withdraw because the network fees are too high. Even when I try to adjust the fee. Lets wait and hear what senior members have to say. I hope theres a solution, otherwise those coins will go to waste.

### Reply 2:
So this is what they replied back with<link> it I guess but no solution given without having to make multiple smaller transactions

Topic: Realistically, how safe is a dedicated HD or SSD as cold storage?
### Original post:
I was just wondering realistically how safe would it be to do a fresh windows and wallet install on an SSD and then unplug it ?I would just keep my SSD unplugged with my bitcoins until I wanted to access it. What ways could this be <truncated> to outside parties? Thanks in advance!

### Reply 1:
Are you talking about putting this on a laptop of some sort? Your asking a broad question and will likely get a lot of suggestions so it would be helpful to have some clarification. That said, if your putting this on an old desktop or laptop (for instance) which you power on once in a while to either update or retrieve the coins, that should work fine (I'm doing something just like this with a virtual machine). If your talking about backing up to a hard drive or ssd and keeping an offline BACKUP, that's something different and should work fine but a USB stick would be a more logical option.If your going to install windows - do you have a ""protected"" connection (at least one that you know is safe) to update the OS from?? Meaning you'd at least want to apply the service pack updates and ensure the firewall is enabled. A fresh install is susceptible (albeit unlikely) to attacks. If you only run through the updates and your not browsing the net, you will probably be OK.If your computer savy, a fresh Ubuntu installation with armory is a great option!Armory also offers a PAPER backup option (highly recommended) which you can use to recover your wallet in the case of hardware failure.good<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 2:
It couldn't be accessed by outside parties. You're essentially doing cold storage in another way. It's interesting, something I hadn't thought of, but yes it would work. The biggest risk would be if it's the only copy you have. Remember even brand new drives can fail <truncated> coins from external threats basically involves separating the private keys from any online (therefore potentially vulnerable) system.Armory does this by using an offline computer (as one method) so the private keys are kept offline there and can never be accessed externally. Users shuttle authorization back and forth with a USB stick. Your method does away with the second computer, by simply using a second operating system and second drive.The Trezor also separates private keys from online systems by holding them on a separate dedicated USB device, which has no OS and is therefore immune even from viruses on the computer it's plugged into.Any of these methods can successfully separate private keys from online threats. Each is a bit different and may work better for different people. However, Trezor I feel is the most complete solution because it handles backups and any other minor security concerns (like di<rest of post truncated>

Topic: Bitcoin regrets...
### Original post:
Given the current price of BTC, can you remember the most <truncated> thing you have purchased? Within the last four years I can remember paying a .2 on gyft for a chili's gift card and converting multiple BTC at a time (like 3-4) to pay rent. That seems insane now!Looking back, that like 3.5k to eat American casual dining food for two, and 45k a month rent on a 400 square foot corporate apartment in a really hole in the wall city.Thoughts?

### Reply 1:
To be honest I didn't knew much about Bitcoin then. Because i was introduced to the Bitcoin in 2015 and didn't know much about it until 2016. But, your story seems amazing and it's really amazing to see such kind of experiences that took place for people who had Bitcoin. After knowing about Bitcoin in 2015 I bought some good stuff using it without knowing its importance. Almost all of the stuff I purchased with Bitcoin were digital goods like, Aws coupons, Windows keys, and some other software related stuff. I wasn't really sure at that time about the value of Bitcoin, but today I know its value and I regret my ignorance of those days. Most of my work aka trading is via Bitcoin and I use it everyday now. You paid 3-4 Bitcoins for paying your rent it really horrible to hear these days because 3-4 Bitcoin can be used to buy houses in many places these days. It is really inspiring yet sad that you spent your Bitcoin, but its really encouraging for many who are onto investing some money on Altcoins.

Topic: Look at the Bitcoin bull run from the policies of China and the United States
### Original post:
As we all know, China and the U.S. are the two countries that have the greatest impact on Bitcoin.At present, the Fed has not yet initiated a deflationary policy, the US dollar continues to be issued, and the interest rate hike proposal has not yet passed. But at the same time, China has not overprinted money. The reasons are worth pondering.The strategic significance of Trump's tariff war with China is to promote capital to move out of China and create a distributed multi-production country competition pattern, so that the United States is no longer restricted by a single supplier and reduces its own strategic risks.Just as China was facing the trouble of capital relocation, COVID-19 broke out. Unexpectedly, due to the good control of the epidemic in China, countries that originally wanted to lure and force manufacturing capital to flee were all captured by the virus. China has achieved a great monopoly advantage for a while. The lifestyle products that were originally not strong in core competitiveness also suddenly gained a competitive advantage. This inflation was reversed back to the United States. The prices of living materials have risen one after another, causing prices to <rest of post truncated>

There is no doubt that the bull market is still there. If my judgment is correct, as countries start to issue additional currencies, there will be a steady stream of funds flowing into the Bitcoin or cryptocurrency market. A recent German news article can also support my argument""German Law Allowing $415B Investment Into Crypto Takes Effect""<link>

### Reply 2:
China has an enormous on Bitcoin and I can't get rid of the idea that China owns also a lot of it. It is not just recently that they closely scan markets and buy up all kinds of assets. They are very advanced when it comes to (financial) technology. I am convinced they own a big bag of Bitcoin and are now running a distraction maneuver by banning the mining operations. Imagine Bitcoin one day makes it to 10 trillion total market cap and China owns 40% of it.

### Original post:
I noticed a lot of these are running on Digital Ocean, Vultr, Linode and the like nowadays, so I figured I should post this here -linode is having a $20 promo right now for new signups (just reposting text that I put on my site), ***NOTE: Linode just started a promo about three hours ago (posting this on February 14th at 1417 GMT) for $20, the code to use on your signup form is 'LOVELINODE'. Linode promos are rare, so you should really take that one if you have any interest in it whatsoever. I got in on a $50 promo, but that was some aberration. I believe this is their first promo since that one (which was around the 1st of August of last year).Linode signup is @ <link> .... or if you want to be nice, you can use <link> .. I had to deposit $5 to access my promo money, I imagine it's still set up the same way. So avoid if you don't want to do that (they do take paypal).

### Reply 1:
There are much cheaper option than this. Even with the promo, this can still be expensive to run a Bitcoin. Bitcoin core only needs 1GB of ram a good CPU and at least 40gb of disk space. Look at lowendbox for even cheaper solutions.I don't get you. The website you provided is a list to the network nodes.

Now many people know bitcoin, but they pay attention to bitcoin at the same time, virtually ignoring a key point, bitcoin's technology sources and blockchain, blockchain technology as early as bitcoin, bitcoin can be regarded as the district Now, we are paying attention to bitcoin, but I hope more people can focus on the blockchain. Bitcoin is indeed a bright spot in the blockchain history, but the development of the blockchain is the birth of bitcoin The ultimate goal of blockchain based what are your views on the development of this area and the future of Bitcoin?

Don't exactly know what would be the ultimate goal of Blockchain would be, neither good with predictions, but with all the hype surrounding ICOs, majority of projects have adopted the theme ""Blockchain for everything"", while a few projects are quite brilliant, and the rest using Blockchain for all the wrong reasons and Blockchain is also getting due attention from <truncated> institutions where the theme is more on the lines of ""Blockchain not Bitcoin.""No denying the fact that Blockchain being a foundational technology would have a huge impact in future. Like the banks say, they might implement Blockchain for faster transactions, lower costs, and security. If I let my imagination run a bit, maybe a government or two might even try to create some system of control through Blockchain, but I think it's more of a ticket to a decentralized future and Bitcoin being Blockchain technology's first implementation it would have a big impact on how it evolves.

### Reply 2:
The blockchain is the bigger thing here when it comes into the minds of the business people and the people in the tech field. They don't care about bitcoin, cause they don't want bitcoin to succeed as there is a lot more money in companies like paypal, google pay, etc The blockchain is something that they can use, or their customers demand people to use in certain fields to improve transparency by an INSANE AMOUNT. But time will tell if companies want to be transparent.

Topic: The Morality of Bitcoin (Or Why One Libertarian Has It All Wrong)
### Original post:
I've a bone to pick with a libertarian. Possibly more than one, but not everyone. At the moment, my focus is this one (who also penned this and this and this). Surely, Gary North's ax is sharp as a samurai sword with so much grinding.Mr. North is a well-known and respected libertarian and economic expert (if you run in those circles). For people who desire freedom (a term I use exclusively in the political sense), what he says is important to ponder. Such reflection has led me to three conclusions: 1) his understanding of bitcoin is minuscule; 2) he is contradicting some of his own principles by denouncing bitcoin, and; 3) he is blatantly ignoring his own field of theoretical science - Austrian economics - and, more specifically, praxeology, the logic of action and the science of means. Although irrelevant, these conclusions lead me to suspect he is intentionally putting his erudition aside because it conflicts with his worldview.To substantiate my conclusions, I'm not going to discuss bitcoin's technical aspects, its potential benefits, or why it matters. There are people far more capable to present the likes of transferring digital property more securely, decentralized trust, etc<rest of post truncated>

Topic: What If There Is A Ban
### Original post:
We all agree we're living in a crazy world and what's far worse is that it is managed by a bunch of clowns..So, let's think wildly, one day US were to further increase the censorship just like some of the other countries in the world, they ban bitcoin, they ban VPN, they pass legislation for those who mine/trade/spend btc will be sent to jail.(Let's not say it's not going to happen. It can! You never know just like you would never have known that there's a war in 2022.)Other countries start to follow.Where will you be and what kind of life will it be and how is it going to impact yours?

### Reply 1:
US would never outright do any bans like that. US citizens are way too concerned about freedom to let the government start banning it, though there are plenty of people uneducated on Bitcoin who think we should ban it just because they don't know what they are talking about, and I'm sure there are some people in Congress who think likewise.But US doesn't ban stuff like that we regulate it. Like look at the SEC now, they are starting to try to impose their negative will on crypto by regulating in in bad ways. This could get bad, and all it will do is hurt US citizens. It might get a lot tougher to for altcoins to find a following in the US if every altcoin has to go through tons of government red tape to be offered in the US. And it looks like the SEC wants to take drastic action against crypto exchanges and try to steal their business and give it to banks by possibly saying that only banks can custody cryptocurrencies for people. This would be bad for the industry cuz if exchanges aren't allowed to custody cryptocurrencies then exchanges aren't allowed to operate because even just to trade or buy or sell crypto the exchange has to hold it for some amount of time. But it would also <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 2:
Let's say governments won't ban everything especially in non communism countries and countries that have freedom, democracy and no dictator. Governments will get a lot of debates in their nations, even inside their Congress their will be supporters for Bitcoin, cryptocurrency and blockchain industry. Don't worry.Not all nations will follow big countries like the USA. Small nations like El Salvador have their own social, politics and economics conditions. They have to choose their best ways to cool down their national debts, economic crisis and they will be first nations that make big changes globally. They don't have big power like big nations but they are countries that will initiate new trends.

The history of Cryptocurrency is a journey that started with the creation of Bitcoin(BTC) which is most well-known digital coin Basically the idea of creating a digital currency was explored by computer scientists and a cryptographic hey introduced the concept of digital money in 1980.First Bitcoin:The most well-known currency(BTC) was created in 2009 known as the famous Bitcoin Pizza Day witnessed by the first Bitcoin. The whitepaper A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System laid out the blueprint for a decentralized currency system that reeled on blockchain on January 3, 2009.First use of BTC:First-time Bitcoin(BTC) is used by Small community and tech enthusiasts.

We can also make an addition of the first bitcoin transaction made by Satoshi Nakamoto to Hal Finney, this together with the history of bitcoin pizza remain unforgettable in the history of bitcoin in cryptocurrency.They are no where to be found today, there are many accusations base on the account of scam on them which they took part, people now hold their coins on a non custodial wallet and avoid the use of a custodial means to store their bitcoin.This does not include in the bitcoin network, but we have them on other cryptocurrencies.We also needs to be informed that they exist in altcoins but the rate of their scam is far bigger than the advantage and benefits they served us, because scam rate in them are high.

### Reply 2:
I'd like to add a few points that, in my opinion, are noteworthy in Bitcoin's history.Bitcoin's First Halving (2012)This marked a significant cycle that had a profound impact on the Bitcoin network, as it reduced the block reward by 50%. During the first halving in November 2012, the block reward for BTC was halved from 50 BTC to 25 BTC. However, during this first halving, the price of Bitcoin didn't experience significant changes until, eventually, at the end of 2017, its price underwent a drastic shift. It was a truly surprising moment.El Salvador's Adoption of Bitcoin (2021)An astonishing international development occurred when El Salvador announced its decision to legalize Bitcoin as an official currency. This decision stood in stark contrast to several major countries that were implementing restrictions or even outright bans.

Topic: Openbazaar needs your support
### Original post:
After 6 years, it appears that this implies that the cryptospace does not need a decentralized marketplace. There were also people in the community that described Openbazaar as something similar to a webbrowser for a very small segment of users. Thy are slowly proven to be correct.It needs your support.Over the past several months, we have been relying on OpenBazaars donation funds to support these infrastructure costs, but those funds will be depleted shortly. At OB1, we have desperately tried to secure more funding to not only maintain OpenBazaars support costs, but execute the next phase of the protocol that we believe can unlock explosive user adoption. Sadly, we have been unsuccessful and have no choice but to discontinue these supporting services.We would like to apologize for the short notice, which is the result of last minute funding plans falling-through. We will do everything in our power to try and extend the window so that users can safely withdraw their funds from their OpenBazaar and Haven wallets.If you have been positively impacted by OpenBazaar or you believe in the mission & vision of a global decentralized marketplace, we need your financial support today.

### Reply 1:
OpenBazaar made a nice attempt. Buy after a few years of peripherally watching their platform, it doesn't seem like they moved that much forward unfortunately; and quite surprisingly too since I don't think they even have a close competitor.Imo it seems like their time is cut short unfortunately, but I applaud them for their attempt.

### Reply 2:
This is sad news but it is what it is. Openbazaar must have fallen short of something for failing to reach the level of adoption they set as goal. It may be that they are indeed not doing well in promoting their marketplace. Or perhaps people are simply more attracted to larger marketplaces with much more merchants offering a much wider array of products, regardless of their being centralized. Or probably the larger market likes the idea of online shopping without the need to download and install apps. There are just so many possible reasons behind. But the bottom-line is that they failed to capture their target market. They need to do some ""what went right, what went wrong"" sessions if they wish to move forward and are able to gather the necessary amount. They cannot just count on ""community support"" alone because the community has preferences and taste and likes and dislikes and all. Even if they are able to gather sufficient funds out of donations to continue operating, without significant changes or improvement, this thing will eventually happen again in the future.

Topic: Bitcoin Hashrate Increases
### Original post:
When halving happened in May 2020, crypto analysts expected that the Bitcoin hashrate would decrease. However, data from Blockchain.com shows the Bitcoin hashrate returned to the level before halving. This indicates that the crypto mining industry remains healthy after halving and a little selling pressure from miners.The combination of at least miners selling Bitcoin, an optimistic long-term technical structure, increasing HODL and growing interest from large investors and institutions, increases the chances of a new rally in 2021.

### Reply 1:
This could have been due to the fact that majority of mining firms will find it easier to incur handsome fees & increased prices over the decade. They know very well with more speed they will be able to mine faster, since network difficulty is increasing as well, they have to either keep up the speed or increase it to ATH++.Who knows, someone might just have triggered mega mining farm after halving.

### Reply 2:
Miners are leaving, but the remaining miners have asics which are much more efficient. While the typical asic miner in 2016 (the S9) did 12TH, now the typical miner does 50TH, while only consuming about twice as much power.The net effect, subtracting those who leave and the few remaining who upgraded, is that the hash rate increases. BUT! China is seasonal, summer electricity is cheap while winter is not, so there might be an interesting effect later as winter approaches.Later on at the next halving you will see a more pronounced effect, perhaps finally diminishing the hashrate due to being unprofitable to mine at any electricity price (except possibly free renewable).

If bitcoin will be used as our daily payment is it possible that schools will be accepting it as payment for tuition fees? And if it will be accepted they need to teach the students the use of bitcoin and give the knowledge to use it and how it works.

### Reply 1:
The only way bitcoin can go into school curriculum and be taught in class is when the countries government has accepted bitcoin into their system as a legal currency. This might not happen in some countries, but if it will, it will have to take a very long time to happen.

### Reply 2:
I think it will never be possible. People would never adopt such an unstable currency as medium of daily transactions. Moreover as of now its too slow and costly to transact.

Do not use bitcoin for betting? ""Double the price in just an hour of playing"". We all know betting is all about chances and the chances is really low. Also, don't use bitcoin if you're buying low amount or low value prices because the transaction fees might be higher than your original payment right? In the 7th commandment, we must be really careful in choosing an alternate cryptocurrency because there are many ponzi scheme platform today and I suggest go to ETH or LTC

But what proof do they have ?

Which is an alternative, centralized money.And if those fake BTC get destroyed by the central authority (in this case Mt Gox), the media will say BTC is not secure, while such paper money have nothing to do with BTC...Why people store money on bank or exchange accounts ? it just neutralizes all the advantages of possessing real BTC.

I understand, they had the same business plan as bank after all. Except for the baillout part.

Topic: Why Bitcoins extraordinary price rise is driven by more than speculation
### Original post:
One of the most potent criticisms that has been leveled against the popular cryptocurrency Bitcoin, is that the price is intimately linked with speculation and that there are few fundamental factors driving its extraordinary rise from $5 per Bitcoin in 2011, to $600+ today.Those with a more bullish dispositon on the cryptocurrency counter that there are wide variety of factors playing a role in determining its price.<link>

### Reply 1:
Infrastructure investment brings value as well. When your company is spending on building a bit coin infrastructure you have an interest in bit coin doing well. That brings some price support with it. Adoption will bring more as will additional infrastructure.

### Reply 2:
I'd straight out have a tendency to disagree. I would assert that most of the price is driven by speculation - the rest is simply some small driving factors that have little influence whatsoever. While I have stated that increased infrastructure should lead to higher prices, there is no definite price region anyone can predict simply because the whole thing is too grey. Not to mention, what justifies a price at $640 where we are now and $700 or $500 in the future...Even their 'factors' are simply just the infrastructure and supply and demand really.

Topic: How long will it take for people to realize Bitcoin isn't just a currency?
### Original post:
In fact, it's a terrible currency. Bitcoin as a currency can't be used for micropayments, but Bitcoin derivative currencies can. Bitcoin cannot be inflated for state run money supplies, but Bitcoin derivatives can. Bitcoin cannot be used for trading legacy financial instruments, but Bitcoin derivatives can. Bitcoin cannot be backed by tangibles, but Bitcoin derivatives can. Bitcoin doesn't do any of the things traditional financial institutions want, but Bitcoin derivatives can do them better than what they currently have. Think of the Blockchain as the building blocks of a Minecraft style new World of Finance.

### Reply 1:
Having said this, let's start seeing some Bitcoin derived currencies! Micro-payment channels implementation now in bitcoinj is a good place to start.

### Reply 2:
I'm not arguing you with it being/not-being a currency but some of the other points you've made show that you clearly have little to no knowledge of what you are talking about. It's like the stupid preaching to the stupider.

Why we no longer accept Dwolla and an open letter to Ben Milne also posted on <link> no longer accepts Dwolla payments because there are chargebacks occuring.We have witnessed 9 cases where a Dwolla payment we received (and credited) was reversed days or even weeks later. In another 8 cases, Dwolla payments simply disappeared from the transaction history a few weeks after they were completed. In all cases these were payments which were listed as CREDITED on our statements and were confirmed via email and the downloadable statement.In none of these cases did Dwolla notify us of any issues. Instead, the transaction record was silently edited and our account balance simply dropped by a few thousand dollars each time.The individuals who sent the payment, once credited on TradeHill, immediately bought BTC and disappeared. Our evidence suggests these individuals were well aware of Dwollas weaknesses and were explicitly exploiting them.Our claims are supported by past CSVs, statements, emails, and recorded telephone conversations which we have systematically collected over the last two weeks.Unfortunately we are currently on the hook to cover these losses and continue to receive no cooper<rest of post truncated>

Topic: We have to be aware that bitcoin will not last forever
### Original post:
Like all digital technology, it is unquestionable that sooner or later bitcoin will have to be replaced by a superior technology, just as in the past we saw many devices become obsolete when at the time seemed insurmountable, such as CDs or PCs.Obviously this will happen in a gradual way, but I do not believe that bitcoin can retain its current dominance for more than ten years before starting to fall into disuse, although perhaps its influence could persist in the market about ten years.In the end, bitcoin is likely to subsist for many years, but by then it will have evolved in such a way that it will be virtually unrecognizable for todays standards, and in fact it is difficult that in 15 years there is something similar to the current cryptocurrencies before the spectacular advances in digital technology that are approaching.

### Reply 1:
Though nothing on earth last forever. Still yet we can't still say that bitcoin won't last forever because we haven't still yet still see what bitcoin really have for this digital world century. But I must still say that, bitcoin might not last 3 decades more.

### Reply 2:
CDs are a weak analogy. Code is more flexible in what it can do and how easy it is to change. As such, Bitcoin is in a much better position to adapt than any sort of physically manufactured product. How does this make any sense? It's going to evolve but still be obsolete? Which is it?

Topic: Will the high demand in BTC cause more supply of BTC someday?
### Original post:
Will the amount of bitcoins available forever remain 21 million BTCs? Many people are joining the Bitcoin bandwagon as days go by. Will there be a time when the 21 million BTCs won't be enough ? Any suggestions ?

### Reply 1:
you are thinking about it wrong. there are 21 million whole bitcoins but also there is 8 decimals after the 1 whole bitcoin. which means there are <truncated> satoshi available and if you think about it, that amount is more than enough for the number of people who might be interested in bitcoin and want to use it. it will never be every single person on earth so it is enough.and with the value of bitcoin rising with more adoption, 1 satoshi will have a meaningful value. currently at $0.00014

### Reply 2:
What is the relation of forked coins to his question? Forked coins is not bitcoin and will never be. Bitcoin's supply is fixed to 21M and no one can add even a single piece of it to the blockchain. Thatis the big advantage of bitcoin to the fiat currency and even trading stocks because once the demand goes high it's price will go up with it.

### Reply 2:
As with everything, the more participants a market or ecosystem counts, the less centralized it will become. If at some point even the average person is able to set up nodes, connects with its favorite merchant or whatever entity, know that we'll be very close to LN deployment on a very large scale. Let all the naysayers talk as much as they want, at some point they will have to acknowledge the value and purpose of LN.If they then still act like it isn't worth anything, then they are nothing more than a bunch of shitty trolls. If you don't like it, don't use it. It's not that anyone here will be forced to use LN. This market is all about the choices that you have, and you have the full right to say no to LN. I personally am satisfied with Bitcoin already, and will likely not use it, but I know how much potential it has in the very long term.

Topic: India banned bitcoin but I dont want to quit bitcoins ??
### Original post:
Bitcoin has became integral part of my life since last couple of years... I started with faucets then I bought and started trading bitcoins and later started writing articles about bitcoins and cryptos and now I am spending a lot of my time in this like altcoins trading and many things..... with this news coming I am shocked.. please tell me what can I do to continue on this as RBI will stop any transactions of bitcoin from my bank so I wont be able to buy or sell bitcoins which will make everything useless what work i do... please advice me what can i do in this situation

### Reply 1:
You did not help him bro, I think if there is nothing good you can say in a thread dont waste your time on replying here and dont waste our time reading your non sense reply dont just post to get the required activity on your sig campaign!For the OP, I think it will help if you and other bitcoin user in your country will have a group and try to file an appeal to your government because in your case it will broke your life if that will totally happen.

### Reply 2:
Can the news from where dude? Is this the source? <link> this is just a concern from the RBI only, While the Indian Government Authority doesn't prohibit Bitcoin trade I think is still safe.

well but what he is doing only matter because of XT, otherwise he wil be ignored, but i'm starting to believe that there should be also a consensus about choosing the right developers and not only about the new version to implementi know that bitcoin is open source but this does not mean that any dev is ok to work on it...

Bitcoin Price Could Fall to $3,000, Says One of Cryptos Most Bullish VC<link>

### Reply 1:
Well it could go to a million dollars if you listen to other guys who are bullish and supposedly experts. Truth is nobody knows, you just have to educate yourself and make your own decisions. I stopped listening to so-called experts a long time ago- they generally get it wrong! Think of CNBC, every time they make a prediction it does the opposite!

### Reply 2:
well everyone and their own opinion. people say different things about bitcoin but no one can accurately predict what will happen to bitcoin in years to come. for the fact that bitcoin is facing some challenges which has affected its price recently, that doesnt mean in the upcoming months it wont bounce back

Topic: Binance is launching it own block chain ..
### Original post:
NewIn an era in which theres a blockchain for everything and everyone is launching a blockchain, its not surprising that a cryptocurrency exchange should get in on the act. Its even less surprising that Binance should be the platform to do so. The ambitious exchange, buoyed by record profits and substantial goodwill within the crypto community, is planning to launch a proprietary blockchain that will perform a number of roles.<link> (Binance Is Launching Its Own Blockchain - Bitcoin News)Logical- a lot of EX want to switch to DEX.

### Reply 1:
The way binance have capitalised on the last few months in the industry has been quite remarkable. They are fast on their way becoming the number one exchange over coinbas at this rate. They've reacted really well the hacks and now keeping ear to the ground they are ready to lead the way in the creation of a successful decentralised exchange. Big thumbs up from me

### Reply 2:
If their decentralize exchange act as really decentralized without making profit for binanace as a company then I think it will be worth it to try their exchange. Having in mind that they are young exchange and that they accumulated a lot of costumers and if they do their DEX right then we can expect high volume there. We now for instance have bitshares which is old and is somewhat decentralized exchange but it lacks huge volume.

It's not anything strange and It happened before with other blocks [1][2][3 you would've found the answer If you searched a little bit too <link> [1] <link> <link> <link>

### Reply 2:
Miner [F2Pool] is a mining pool. Everybody that mines with them gets a share of the 12.5B. What 1 transaction means is that they only get the transaction fees of that transaction on top of the 12.5B. This is obviously less than including say 1000 transactions, but some say it is tiny bit fast to not include transactions, thus generating more blocks for them.

Topic: The Winklevii Bitcoin ETF Makes Headlines
### Original post:
After the SEC's rejection, nothing has changed in bitcoin for the stated reason - if that was the actual reason for the rejection. Yet, now we see that the SEC is reviewing the rejection of the ETF, naturally creating some favorable speculation. I don't expect the ruling to change, but if it does, the behind-the-scenes politics may be why. If there's one thing I've learned about the government, it's how we think the government works and how the government actually works are worlds apart.Still, I don't expect anything to change.

### Reply 1:
The whole bitfinex saga will confirm to them that they were right to reject the ETF. Remember the ETF's price would have been based on the weighted average of the major exchanges where trading took place, and shenaniggans where you suddenly can't withdraw fiat which means the btc price soars as people try to get coins out, proves their point about unregulated exchanges.A BTC ETF will only get approved when the majority of trading is done on regulated exchanges like Gemini and GDAX.

### Reply 2:
It isn't surprising that they're reviewing it. They have incentives to - they'll appear open minded and they won't have as much effect on the price. Makes them appear more neutral and reasonable and gives them a chance to consider Bitcoin's recent price movements, its volatility and how they could regulate it.

Topic: Transaction Cancelation
### Original post:
I have seen some people that say their bitcoin transactions took too long and then got cancelled. I think the reason would be low transaction fee or some other. My question is that what would happen to the transaction fees submitted by the user in this case ? Would it also be returned?Why does this occur ?I am asking this just for curiosity. Even though the chances of cancellation are very low.

### Reply 1:
Yep, it would for sure.A transaction is basically rejected either 'coz of low fee or 'coz of dust output. Each & every transaction gets their priority in the blockchain network. There 're a bundle(bunch) of unconfirmed transactions waiting for the confirmation -> <link> . Basically, you've to spend more fee to get higher priority in the list & you'll get added to the next block. Dust outputs 're normally created by poor ponzi/gambling sites which ultimately results in the rejection of the transaction.

all right

Topic: Ex-Belgian Finance Minister Wants Crypto Banned Like Drugs
### Original post:
Why are some lawmakers bitter towards Bitcoin. Whenever a bank collapses, they quickly attribute it to Bitcoin. If there is hyperinflation, they say it is Bitcoin that caused it. I am terribly sick and tired of this. For example, Johan Van Overtveldt, a member of the European Parliament and the former Minister of Finance of Belgium, said in a tweet that Crypto(with bitcoin being the chief of them) should be banned in the same way that governments ban drugs1. Bitcoin didn't do nothing. Instead, it is the terrible policies of the politicians and their bad leadership that cause these financial institutions to fail. Imagine if they were in control of bitcoin, it wouldn't have gone past 5 years.The article mentioned that soon, members of parliament would vote on regulating digital assets licensing for the European Union. I don't even know how to feel about this if it falls through.How do you feel whenever you read stuff like this on the internet?Do you agree that bitcoiners should compile a record of politicians who oppose it? So that when elections come around, they will have the knowledge necessary to select only candidates who support crypto as suggested by Charles Hoskinson?What do <rest of post truncated>

I came across a topic asking if people can really change their name to Bitcoin for 200btc hereand my answer was yes speaking for myself.That very topic reminded me of an issue my brother had as he was scammed of $2000 worth of BTC but we had to track the transaction using the transaction ID on Blockchain and when tracked, we finally found the coin in a wallet containing over $600m(36754.6) worth of Bitcoin after several transactional movement.My questions~Are there private individuals who own and posses such amount of Bitcoin?~Why will one posses such amount as an Individual?~Are there any consequences to this?

### Reply 1:
Owners maybe of crypto exchanges, or gambling sites.Not sure what you mean by this, You can see the Top 100 richest bitcoin addresses. We don't have names associated to bitcoin addresses, except a few again, including exchanges. So there is no consequences, the only thing is that since it is in a public ledger, anyone can track the movement, dates when it was move, where it move, fees associated with it.

Almost all the time whenever you find a bitcoin address containing a very large amount of bitcoin (like the one in your screenshot) it belongs to a centralized service that is holding other people's bitcoins (in this case a centralized exchange called Binance).But it is not unheard of for an individual to own that much bitcoin either, remember that bitcoin price was not always this high and will not remain in this level forever. As it keeps rising, a small amount today would look like a lot in the future. For example the 50BTC block reward was once worth barely $0.5. Many individuals have bought or mined bitcoin those days.There is no ""consequence"" of having money! Why would there be? There can only be consequence if the owner advertises it and puts themselves at risk of theft or other types of attacks/harm.

bitcoin does not waste energy. it uses the energy that would be produced anyway which previously was simply not sold. by bitcoin as a new industry buying up more energy helps support power production to pay off its initial build costs earlier thus enabling them to expand soonerwith that now explaining that bitcoin is not a waste.. bitcoin is the sole network that uses the most energy to secure the network. it costs alot for a malicious pool to try to do a chain re-org. thus it secures the immutability of transactionsalso with the cost of mining as a underlying (non-zero) value to the market price because no one would dare sell a bitcoin for a couple digits these days as no one can acquire bitcoin so cheap(unlike its forks/alts). this support is good for bitcoin as it adds to the store of value protectionbitcoin offers many things.imagine you are a poor country earning a couple dollars a day salary. you cannot just put a bit of your salary towards buying Tesla or Apple shares as you have to buy whole shares just to become an investor. yet people can invest into bitcoin with as small amount as they like buying decimal amounts of bitcoinbitcoin also has its own features where its defl<rest of post truncated>

Topic: Use Case - Bitcoin intl money transfers
### Original post:
Good article detailing a money transfer to China. <link> that even with low volumes and market depths and an immature, inefficient market, Bitcoin still offers the cheapest solution to send money. With more developed exchanges and greater volume, transfer costs will fall precipitously even from these levels.Bitcoin FTW

### Reply 1:
You're an idiot. The risk is too high to send any USABLE amount of USD. Ask your chinese friend, when was their last time to send $100 to family in China. Also if you're Chinese (which i'm sure you're not), you will know there are Money transferring service with lower fee. I can send $100 with only $5 fee. I can send $10,000 with $150 in fee. These services are legal business. Western Union and bank wiring arent the only ways. Good luck with BTC-exchange in China.

### Reply 2:
I recently found out that one of the friends i knew from when i lived China has got cancer, and i decided to send her some money to help her out. So i tried to wire $450 to her. Was immediately charged a fee of about $50 (more than 10% of the transfer amount), and now almost 4 weeks later she still hasnt received the transfer and in the meantime she doesn't have money to pay for her medicine or even food. I phoned up my bank and asked them whats up, and they replied that if i wanted them to do an inquiry about the transfers current ETA, it would cost me another $50. fuck that shit

Topic: Bitcoin moves like Gold?
### Original post:
According to the recent price chart, Bitcoin's move has been very similar to Gold's move.Recently, after Trump delivered speech, the price of Bitcoin and Gold both went down. And there were other cases that Bitcoin's move follows after Gold's move.But is this still enough to say that Bitcoin moves like Gold?

### Reply 1:
Why not Silver? It also moves like any other commodity. Why not Copper for that instance? Which speech? Again a movement in same direction does not mean that the correlation exists unless it is explicitly proven. Which is again a rare thing to prove and so it is better to assume that these are coincidences and not related. Possible that people moved from gold to bitcoin, question is does it really matter? People change sectors all the time to keep up with trends or manage risks. No. They are two different assets. And you did not provide any proof to substantiate your claim.

### Reply 2:
There are a lot of similarities between Gold and Bitcoin, like it being a Store of Value and it is this feature that gives it a price behavior, similar to Gold, because investors are using it for the same reasons. (to hedge against possible instability in the economic and political environment)The thing that is very different between the two is the volatility of the price, because the Bitcoin price is a lot more volatile than Gold. You will rarely find a price spike of say $300 to $600 in a day with the Gold price. Satoshi also developed Bitcoin on the same concept as Gold, based on it's rarity and diminishing supply, so a lot of Goldbugs also like to invest in Bitcoin for the same reasons.

### Reply 1:
The decentralized currency and the associated transaction system operate on the basis of an open book that records lists of transactions, called blocks, linked together to avoid manipulation, hence the name of the blockchain. The ""blocks"" produced every ten minutes have a maximum size of 1 megabyte. Unfortunately, during some hours of high activity these blocks have reached levels close to this maximum size.The acceptance of technology is making its way into several industries beyond even finance and banking. For all that, Bitcoin as a world currency, digital, decentralized, without authority still has a long way to go.

Topic: How I managed to boost the Bitcoin economy at zero cost
### Original post:
For those of us who are not great spenders and are not into the latest gadget it is sometimes difficult to spend our stash of bitcoins. Well, now I have found a way.I have cancelled my 9 year running subscription to a non-profit for 180 euros per year. I will need some self-discipline to keep my donations going, but for sure they will be only in bitcoins.

### Reply 1:
I believe OP has cancelled the auto donations in fiat, and now donate manually to the same non-profit organisation in bitcoin. Hence, will need some ""self-discipline to keep my donations going"". OP is accelerating bitcoin flow and he is spending the same as before.

### Reply 2:
Do you spend it directly from bitcoin to the non-profit organisation, or is a fiat to bitcoin to non-profit way of donating?

There are 2 types of Bitcoin wallet that Cold wallet and Hot wallet.Hot wallet is a wallet address where users can spend electronic money from any time and almost always have to stay connected to the Internet to be able to remain connected to the bitcoin network.On the other hand, cold wallets are the opposite, when using a cold wallet you do not intend to use regular expenditures, but you can still get money from someone else at any time. Cold wallet will not connect to the Internet directly, as it is used to store bitcoin offline. Without a connection between the purse and the internet, hackers can not steal money from your wallet.

Topic: Bitcoin-backed fiat loans are a rip-off
### Original post:
Yes, it looks very good on paper: Keep your bitcoin and get fiat to buy a house for example. But...- You lose complete ownership on your BTC. What prevents some companies with funny names (""YouHodler"" - seriously! - ) and created only 2 years ago to escape with your BTC?- the LTV (the amount of BTC you need to put as collateral) is usually 100% of the loan!- AND you pay also interest rate on that: So the lender gets your bitcoins (that he can borrow to others) + the interest rate that you gave him!- Not to mention that if the price of Bitcoin decreases, you have to increase the amount of BTC put as collateral. Imagine taking a loan and each month the lender asks you for your month salary and alters your loan if he detected that your salary has decreased (even if you pay the interest rate correctly)! Bitcoin-backed loans are really insane and they make no sense at all! I guess that's because there is not enough competition on this market for the moment but I don't understand how someone with a sane mind can purchase this for a start.

### Reply 1:
The only interest that ever makes sense to say it's a good thing, is the amount you'll collect if you're a long term holder of Bitcoin. Loans never really make sense if you can avoid them. It's basically signing up to lose money, so that you can have something sooner. If I offered you a pizza today, but you'd have to overpay 2x the amount of what it's worth, instead of waiting to have it in a week, you'd probably not go for it. Although, this is also the first time I'm hearing of a Bitcoin backed loan, that's given in fiat. Sounds like a scam to me, doesn't really make much sense for the borrower or the lender considering the high volatility of Bitcoin, which I'd assume is written in the contract, that's if it isn't just an outright scam. The only exceptions are houses, and while it's technically still a loan, not many people can get houses without one, and much of the time they're needed to be able to work in certain places etc. However, I wouldn't be using my Bitcoin for securing a loan. To be honest, I'm highly sceptical of the companies that are offering this, wouldn't consider them trustworthy at all.

### Reply 2:
They've been around for ages (in bitcoin time) , I think Celsius was launched in 2017 for example.It works nicely for short-time intervals with small sums when basically you're not risking much as you can overcollateralize it easily, and it might not be fiat but for example, Darkstar_ offers USDT loans.Speaking of larger sums, like mortgages we've just had a thread about it, and I've already pointed out the flaws and risks in it and also the pro, not going to dive in this again but when you play with large sums and little reserves it sounds to too dangerous for me.Hmmmm, no! Let's not open Pandora's box once again, we should have learned the last 100 times nothing good comes out of it.

My backgrounds is in security and specifically in authentication technology like smart cards, I have been watching Bitcoin for some time but the recent security issues has prompted me to take a closer look.Bitcoins use an algorithm called ECC, specifically it uses ECDSA; this is the same algorithm that is used on the most recent DoD smart cards (though they use different input parameters to the algorithm).With that in mind it would not be terribly difficult to apply these same cards (or at least a derivative of them) to Bitcoin. This can have a number of positive side effects for example in the the typical smart card design pattern one can say:1) The key material is generated on the card2) The key material never leaves the card in clear text3) All operations using the key material happen on the card4) Access to perform operations with the key material require authentication5) Failure to authenticate locks the card preventing use by the attacker6) Cards are designed to be both tamper evident and resistant to different levels of attacksBasically when properly used the keys cant be stolen, transactions are restricted to the card owner; in other words the current issues of wallet theft<rest of post truncated>

I am by no means an expert in smart cards at all, but I think the chief problem with this approach is that you still have to trust the device reading it. Correct me if I'm mistaken:Say we're in the future where we can carry our Bitcoin wallet around on a smartcard. I go to Meze Grill, order something delicious and stick my card in the card reader. It asks me to agree to the 0.5BTC or whatever the future price of something tasty is, I tap ""yes"", it passes the transaction to my smart card and asks it to sign the transaction, before pushing it to the network.Assuming I'm not misunderstanding something, so far so good.Now what if the reader is compromised some way? With a smart card approach, there's absolutely no readout or anything of that nature that I can trust. The reader might ask me to agree to 0.5BTC and then ask my smart card to sign a transaction for 50BTC. The risk is reduced at brick and mortar businesses, but it's still there.The risk is also there for credit cards of course, but drastically reduced because you can charge back credit card transactions that are fraudulent - you can't charge back Bitcoin (that's one of it's charms).I definitely think pocket-wallet devices ar<rest of post truncated>

Topic: How long bitcoin will survive ?
### Original post:
Have you guys ever think to how long is bitcoin will survive in this world ? Well, I mean is there anything that can make bitcoin bankrupt or low price, then possibly will make bitcoiners doesn't want to invest anymore. And also is there any solution to avoid those thing. Just wonder to know.

### Reply 1:
The only honest answer is: for as long as two people or more believe Bitcoin has use and value. The schedule for block rewards is set to extend out to the year 2130 so bitcoin mining (in its true sense) can continue for that long as long as there are transactions to produce work for. Maybe an equally good question is: what could end bitcoin? If we think about it from that perspective we can identify what threats exist to seriously harm bitcoin.One such risk is Governments. They can ban the use of bitcoin among retailers which would seriously diminish the opportunity for adoption growth.What else?

### Reply 2:
Understood, me too as personal seen those too far to think about, but just pretend it because when we're really comfort and enjoy the thing what we have learned here then will gone just because there are some naughty stuff break everything.

If you are going to buy and sell bitcoins then you need to comply with the requirements of the state and you must have a business permits. If you will not comply your business cannot operate or will be disallowed by banks to do further transactions. And so to be sure that the government and banks will support your business you must abide by the law.

Topic: Could we crowdfund a movie about Satoshi Nakamoto?
### Original post:
I think we should take bitcoin/crypto marketing to the next level and motivate all bitcoin and crypto friends to crowdfund a movie about Satoshi Nakamoto. For example, the movie biography about Steve Jobs cost about 12 million USD. So I think it's even affordable... As main protagonists I would suggest Dave Kleiman (scott patterson) and Hal Finney (Willem Dafoe/ Sean Maguire), and a third person/satoshi (who is just unknown and whose identity is not clarified;Keanu Reeves). Director: Danny Boyle or Steven Spielberg. Screenplay: Aaron Sorkin Music: Hans Zimmer. We could do this as huge bitcoin community project and if every bitcoin/crypto friend contribute even a small amount, we would have the money tomorrow.It would be even better if a crypto celebrity would start the call to increase the range!!

### Reply 1:
I would be more interested in a documentary instead of a movie but not for the purpose of marketing.Majority of the current breed of investors and the future buyers or users probably do not care who invented Bitcoin. Maybe they are just buying because Elon is into it. I'm sure there are also people who are interested to know his story but to use it as a marketing stunt would be a failure.

### Reply 2:
Yes it would not be the actual Satoshi -is there ever anyone by that as a real name- I think in every Bitcoin-er's head we all have this view of the whole thing, so if there is to be a movie it's shouldn't be about satoshi but rather about bitcoin, and satoshi won't be centered in the movie, so the movie can have an originality to core bitcoin lovers, there is going to be emphasis about an anonymous creator but that would just be it, I think a good production Company can see the big box office in this if it's done right, there is no point to crowd funding it.

Topic: If we want Bitcoin to go mainstream, we'd better start doing stuff like this.
### Original post:
So I know a lot of us have Bitcoin-related websites and we're used to advertising those sites to other people who already use Bitcoin. But if we're really serious about getting Bitcoin to go mainstream, we'd better start advertising our sites outside of the Bitcoin community. So maybe we'd better take a hint from Dogecoin and their racecar and start doing inexpensive sponsorships. (And I know Dogecoin is kinda tanking right now but that racecar is part of the reason people know about it.) I just recently wrote an article about Mars One for Bitcoin Users to basically provide information on how you can become an official Bitcoin sponsor for US$1250-$6250. Does anybody know any other clever strategies to market our Bitcoin sites?

### Reply 1:
This would be a perfect scenario for some sort of guerrilla marketing strategy. A physical faucet in a high foot traffic area would be a fun way to do it.

### Reply 2:
That forum thing is a good idea, but we'll have to do it in a way that won't make it look like we're just dropping links. Then it'll look like we're just spamming. I would say just participate in the forums you find in a way that looks normal and, if economics comes up in the subject at hand, point out that Bitcoin could solve this problem and that problem if only more people would use it. You ARE going to get the skeptics, so be sure to have some answers ready for the inevitable questions from people who don't know much about how cryptocurrencies work and/or have heard a lot of the bad news.

Topic: Reminder, Bitcoin has intrinsic value: its proof of work
### Original post:
Originally posted in Reddit, I thought I would share this here too:When people argue that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, we need to correct them. As this post from a few months ago explains, Bitcoin's intrinsic value is its proof of work:<link> elaborate, what Bitcoin provides is something that is unique to cryptographic hashing functions: the ability to produce easily verifiable and absolute proof that work was done.This may seem trivial, but it's not. If you have mined a ton of gold, there is no easy way to prove to someone with absolute certainty, that you did so. You can record a video showing a vault filled with gold, but videos can be faked. You can get your gold audited, and provide a certificate showing your holdings, but auditors can make mistakes, or be dishonest. For these reasons, it takes a significant amount of effort for others to determine whether they can trust your claim that you have a certain amount of gold, and unless the gold is physically hauled to them and they are able to test it, they will never know with absolutely certainty if your claim is true.With one way cryptographic hash functions, proof of work can be produced that can be digitally transmitted to<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
+1 Totally agree. Really refreshing to see this post.I feel like a broken record because I've been saying to so many people. When supposed experts say Bitcoin has no intrinsic value it shows they do not understand what it is and therefore their opinions should be called into question.Bitcoin's value is derived from proof of work because Bitcoin is the monetisation of proof of work.

### Reply 2:
Nothing (including gold) has intrinsic value. Value is subjective, it's imputed to goods (gold bars, bitcoins, loaves of bread) in accordance with their expected serviceability in satisfying wants. Value exists in people's heads, it's not some magical essence tied to certain things in the world.

because the world is following a new fashion of new technologies, bitcoin is the most worthwhile, and it is profitable!

### Reply 2:
Every other alternative to Bitcoin has it's serious drawbacks.Gold is not digital, you can't send it across the world in matter of minutes.Bitcoin is not just an investment, it is a form of payment, a currency.There is no currency that is decentralized like Bitcoin.Fiat currency is constantly being printed by governments, losing it's value.Bitcoin has a very strict monetary policy, built into the protocol itself.Big reason why people like Bitcoin is because it is decentralized and no one can take it from you.It has high level of security and privacy. Government would have a really hard time confiscating your bitcoins.

blockchain size is not a problem6 years of the blockchain can fit on your fingernailplus even after the block limit goes to 20mb a block.. that is POTENTIAL capacity, not actual usage..but even if every block of 20mb was filled.. the cost of storage is under 100/$150(5tb hard drive) for 5 years POTENTIAL storageso its no big deal.these days people buying the entire series of World of Warcraft uses more data than bitcointhese days people buying the entire series of Call of Duty uses more data than bitcoin

### Reply 2:
I don't think the size of the blockchain will ever really be an issue. The bandwidth required to download it and perhaps the processing grunt needed to index it are. Progress for both of those are pretty static compared to storage unless you live next door to Google.

If the launch of the Fidelity Digital Asset Services is succesful and it's able to attract financial institutions into getting involved with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the short-term, then I could definitely see this being the trigger that the market needed to start a new organic BTC rally next year with institutions pouring tons of capital into the cryptosphere. We've been lacking some kind of news or event that could push the price up by attracting new capital and investors, I think this could be it.Btw, I'm surprised that this guy isn't so optimistic about seeing 10k this year, most of the time you read about these kind of investors always predicting 10k or above towards the end of year.

Topic: Satoshi Nakamoto is by no Means a Japanese
### Original post:
Forget about what his wiki page is saying or whatever we have read about him. Reading through Satoshi's post on this forum, anyone with common sense and good understanding of English language could see clearly that the Bitcoin founder is by no means a Japanese. I spent the whole day reading through them, and here are some outstanding posts he made prior to his disappearance. The perfect use of English is telling and undeniable. Again, it seems that even @theymos may probably know his true identity (real names and address) according to a forum comment he made in 2010. Where he explained that certain set of first, second, and forth posts were permanently deleted because they probably contains Satoshi's real names and address.

### Reply 1:
There are Japanese in forex forum I sometimes visit and I can see they write perfect grammar. Nothing unusual for a person to learn English as 2nd language.There is no real information about Satoshi but just the things he created. He may not be an American either nor a European unless he will prove himself. No matter what his nationality may be, the crypto community will still be grateful to his product.

### Reply 2:
No one is disputing that a Japanese or someone from anywhere else could learn English as the second language and be good at it. Anyone could learn English from anywhere, speaks, and write at near perfection. What we are saying in this context is that somehow the evidence would be seen in the written words. If you read what English speaking Indian has written, you would know this is an Indian. Same thing with Korean, Chinese, Russian, etc. It is difficult to suppress the mother tongue no matter how good you are with the second language. American of Japanese descent is not the same as Japanese American. Again, Bitcoin is a much complex project that a Japanese inventor won't resist using Japanese language and characters in some of the codes and content. And deploying Japanese names as a way to camouflage his real identity should tell everyone he isn't from that origin.

Topic: Regulation and corruption. There is no 'Us vs. banks/government' in this.
### Original post:
From what we have seen so far in the relatively short 5 year period or so of crypto, we know there is no such thing as a boundary where corruption and outright thievery is concerned.With that in mind, I would like to open up a discussion regarding merits of regulations and the fundamental issues that smashes the illusion that crypto currency and crypto tech is the 'good' - and how it is merely a tool to be used.Marriage with regulation is inevitable, and those that oppose it in many cases have vested interest in doing so for their own profiteering purposes. 'Enemy' you know vs. enemy that persuades you to make him rich with flowery words and greasy promises.Discuss.

Topic: Best wallet to improve Bitcoin privacy, Wasabi, Samourai or something else?
### Original post:
I've looked all over the internet & I can't seem to get a clear answer.A lot of people on Twitter like Samourai. However, I can't see the major reasons why. I find Wasabi really easy to use.What are the main differences between the two?Or is there something better I should look into?

### Reply 1:
The noticeable difference is the minimum amount required for 'mixing' your transactions on those wallets. AFAIK Wasabi requires at least 0.1 BTC for initiating a Coinjoin where Samourai requires less than that. Other than that, you probably want to look at how you handle your addresses instead.

### Reply 2:
Cooler name? hehe. Those you've seen on twitter are probably mobile users that's why they prefer Samourai. It looks like Wasabi has abandoned the idea of creating a mobile app.I was checking wasabiwallet.io and saw them posting an alternative wallet called JoinMarket <link>

<link> has a better layout than most crypto aggregators and has some interesting ICO information. <link> If you want a good Facebook feed (as I like scrolling through Facebook and seeing news) which has the best news selection I've seen. Most of the other Facebook groups are biased or spammed with advertisement. r/cryptocurrency you can't go wrong here, there is a lot of spam, FUD and Shilling but I find most of it gets sorted through.

### Reply 1:
Yes the wallet providers can freeze your wallet for any reason if you do not have access to your coins. So it is important to get a wallet where you own the private key and the wallet providers cannot access your private key. One example is myetherwallet, the software do not have access to your private key.

Topic: Government don't accept Bitcoin.
### Original post:
Our country government don't accept bitcoin. If anyone use bitcoin and know it state police Caught him and give punishment. But i like bitcoin. How can i use it? And I want to explain that bitcoin is not bad for me. How can i successfully explain?

### Reply 1:
I will first advice you not to make use of any custodial service because such services will not give you any private key and if you have problem with them you may end up losing your bitcoin, you will have to make use of noncustodial wallet. You will need to look for people that are ready to buy and sell bitcoin. There will be people in your country that still do sell bitcoin, you can make use of decentralized exchanges that accepts p2p or buy p2p through legit platforms like mycelium local trader. But, be very careful not to fall into scammers tactics because there will be people that will want to scam you. But to be on the safer side, just do not use bitcoin if your governments are criminalising people that are using it. You mean how you can explain bitcoin to someone? You will need to read about that online. Bitcoin is a deflationary currency that was created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, it is an asset because it has a limited supply which will push its price higher over long term as people are also buying it.

### Reply 2:
Sorry mate, there's no explanation that you can give to the government for them to accept or allow you to use bitcoin. They know that it isn't bad but they don't want it because if everyone begins to use it, they will be sidelined. Also, I don't think it's OK for you to continue using Bitcoin at this moment. Like you said, you'll be punished if caught. Tho I know it may be hard for them to know you use it, I suggest you back down, so you don't attract trouble for yourself.

Topic: BTC investors around the world gather around and hear me up!
### Original post:
I do not like to this but i am thinking though that if possible we will unite this time and make a unified decision on the upcoming bitcoin increase. As we all know that the bitcoin market price nowadays has relatively gone good and we are happy about it right? I would like to convey you that if it is possible to hold your btc until the market price will go to 20K USD? I am opening this up so that if you are in favor also with my idea then probably we will have to put a decision together that all of us should hold our btc and let the btc market price rise up to 20k USD and break the record of 2017 highest btc price which is 19K USD. Can we do it altogether? Who is with me raise your right foot or comment down so that we can discuss it below.

### Reply 1:
if you think by posting this comment here you can make people do anything differently then you didn't understand how the market works just like those who are spreading the FUD these days don't!

### Reply 2:
Dude, the moment everybody decides to hodl and nobody sells anymore the bitcoin price starts spiralling down, you know. Any uptrend is and must be a consensus decision of people wanting to buy it and people wanting to sell it at that price.

Topic: Defensive Nuclear Weapon - Armageddon Avoidance - Proof-of-Coinbase -poison pill
### Original post:
<link> Nuclear Option - A Defensive Weapon for Armageddon Avoidance Proof-of-Coinbase (POC) - Poison Pill Bitcoin Nuclear Option (BNO) is a Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) repellent system. It is a built-in nuclear weapon that will act as the last line of defense during a post contentious hard fork in the face of a BU 51% attack against BTC, when BTU has at least 85% hash-power. It is a poison pill, that when made known to the tl;dr BU supporters and miners, it will act as a deterrent and we will avoid the fork in the first place. AssumptionsBU is technically incompetent as a whole BU is actively attacking a $18 billion dollar asset owned by all humanityBU will attack with intent to destroy BTC and rename itself from BTU to BTC Bitcoin will die if above is trueSummaryBNO is a bitcoin fork that activates with the same protocol as BU hardfork. The post fork BTC will not be POW for even a moment. Once the fork occurs there are two coins BTU, with sha256 POW and BTC with POC. NBO activation in core code will be based on 95% signaling, and since its post-fork, BU signaling blocks will not count. All BTC forks by core would essentially be non-contentious. Objective: To stop bitcoin from forking.M<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Hard fork is a hard fork. If BU gets 75% hash power, anything the 25% does is irrelevant because its still a hard fork.

### Reply 2:
So how does BTC ""go to proof of segwit"" without changing the consensus rules in the first place? If you could get 51% of the miners to agree, well... then why not simply just use the 51% majority to initiate segwit directly?

Topic: Who is the brain of Craig S. Wright's crusade?
### Original post:
CSW might be smart enough to brabble some incoherent technical nonsense, but is he really intelligent enough to trick the (at that time) 2nd important developer of Bitcoin (Gavin Andresen) with a sleight like he did in London?I don't believe that. Maybe there is somebody out there who did the planning and CSW was just the guy in the front?Who were CSWs early helpers? I remember there were some people (I will add their names later) who introduced CSW at a bitcoin meeting and the 'rumour' was spreading, that this guy was Satoshi Nakamoto, but is there more info on how they came up with the idea to invite him and who was supporting him from early on?Some names and stories:Michele Seven <truncated>

### Reply 1:
Dunno why you'd assume it was hard.Turns out Andresen had a contract with Wright-- it's one of the pieces of evidence in the florida trial, but Wright is trying to get it suppressed. It will be interesting to find out what it says.

### Reply 2:
Yeah, shame on me for being lazy and not linking it.<link> Items 319, 341.Hopefully the communication between Wright and Andresen gets made public.Kinda crazy that Wright is objecting to it on grounds of it being inauthentic, among other things.

Topic: Most secure storage method?
### Original post:
If you were going to be responsible for storing large amounts of bitcoins, how would you personally go about securing them?

### Reply 1:
So let's say someone knows that I own a large sum of bitcoins. What's to deter someone from holding a gun to my head and threatening to kill me unless I tell them my private key? Point being, holding all bitcoins in 1 wallet doesn't seem too feasible.

### Reply 2:
Assuming they know you have them... and you think like that, there is no help.Otherwise you could try some offline options, or even a few of them at the same time.

Topic: Smile-to-pay - facial payment technology in China
### Original post:
I reckon many people have seen the latest Smile-to-Pay facial payment technology that are introduced in China. Large companies like, Tencent is using this in their popular WeChat app and other companies like Alipay are spending millions to develop their own technology like this. <link> do you think this is a truly revolutionary payment option or is this just an extension of the Chinese surveillance goals? Now, you cannot deny that you made a payment or that you were involved in a payment, because every face is unique. Will the millions of people in China blindly adopt this technology, because these platforms are widely used already or will they opt for something a bit more anonymous like Bitcoin? <The Chinese people are very disciplined, so I think they would just bend the knee again and go for facial recognition.>The convenience is also a big factor, just imagine leaving your home to go shopping without a wallet or anything to remember... you just take a product or pay for a service by looking into a camera and you pay with your face. Let's discuss.

### Reply 1:
Yea, facial recognition technology is definitely not something new, but to my knowledge it has not been used with a payment option before this. I know some Banks takes photo's of all their customers and you simply link that to your fingerprint... so when you want to do something in the Bank.. you simply use your finger to ""unlock"" the account and then the Bank clerk can see a picture of you.. to verify that you are the owner of that account. The concept to pay with your face is nice, but as you said... what happens if identical twins use this feature? Would it also ""verify"" your account, if you use a facial mold of someone else's face, like they do in the movies with makeup?

### Reply 2:
China is taking the social credit system to a new level. Now they would have all money and loans on their face. The own face would be the private key for their wallet. It would be super easy unless people find a way to use others face. I hope they soon integrate a chip in every Chinese to be safe of face copying scam.

It appears CSW is up to his usual nonsense again. Direct quote from bitcoin.org - Yesterday both Bitcoin.org and Bitcoincore.org received allegations of copyright infringement of the Bitcoin whitepaper by lawyers representing Craig Steven Wright. In this letter, they claim Craig owns the copyright to the paper, the Bitcoin name, and ownership of bitcoin.org. In a panic it seems that all references to Satoshis whitepaper were removed, but then when common sense prevailed , the references were put back in . I thought CSW had been too quiet recently !! Whats his next plan ? <link>

Topic: Jaime Dimon, Warren Buffett have the last laugh? This article will make you mad
### Original post:
I have to say that the writer, Lionel Laurent, certainly knows how to push someone's buttons. My head was boiling as I was reading the article. He does not only make it appear that bitcoin is a ponzi scheme, but he also implies that it will be in bigger political trouble, which might argue that we should stop supporting it and its ideals.Who does he think he is?Bitcoin was meant to make all of its investors rich, something that held particular appeal to a millennial generation hungry for a financial boost in a world of crushing student debt, income inequality and low quality jobs. It was meant to be free of Wall Streets corruption and the US governments meddling technocrats. It was meant to be secure, with a price that would go ever higher. For the hardcore evangelists, it would reward its acolytes when the inevitable financial apocalypse arrived. The dollar was destined for scrap. And that we should all stop listening to fuddyduddy experts like Jamie Dimon, Warren Buffett and Jack Bogle. The old closed ways of investing would be usurped by the buying power of the masses. Unsurprisingly, none of this has come to pass. The Bitcoin bubble of 2017 mercifully short and economically con<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
@dothebeats. Is it only to demoralize and to make you stop pursuing getting rich? I reckon the Warren Buffets and the Jaime Dimons of the world do not want the technological development of the whole cryptospace for very clear reasons why. It is threatening the existence of the system that made them wealthy.

### Reply 2:
@Herbert2020. However for now Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon are winning in their bitcoin is a ponzi and bitcoin is rat poison squared representation of the cryptocoin.I reckon the whales dumping their millions in bitcoins also strengthens their representation.

I recently saw someone advising services like these to newbies who asked ""where to invest"" and I just wanted to know what are your views on such services which are now advertising themselves as Bitcoin Banks and offering interest to people to keep their coins with them?

### Reply 1:
That's a good question. Judging by history and by history repeating itself over and over, there is no way I can Trust an exchange or any bitcoin financial service. I simply have to learn to live with that and be prepared for their wrong doings

### Reply 2:
if businesses are calling themselves ""banks"" they they need special BANKING licences.. this is over and above just money service business licences and normal financial regulations.. being a bank is the hardest thing anyone can ever legally attain... and requires a few billion dollars input to get a BANKING licence.so anyone claiming to be a bank is a fraud..try searching out their regulatory statustry searching out their <truncated> them and you will see they have holes

Topic: Bitcoin Outclasses Other Cryptocurrencies as an Investment Option, Heres Why
### Original post:
Cryptocurrency investors have been pushed to move beyond Bitcoin (BTC). With hundreds of altcoins to choose from and several seeing some massive gains thanks to the 2017 bull run, investors have had their pick of the litter when it comes to making speculative investments on what they believe would be the next big thing.However, things havent gone particularly well for a lot of these guys. Earlier today, a tweet from a cryptocurrency investor with Twitter handle (@jratcliff) showed the performances of some of Bitcoins competitors in the industry since the bullish run of 2017.Source link hereNow we know why Bitcoin's dominance over other cryptocurrencies are overwhelming.It seems to me that institutions, companies and other organizations worldwide are paying their attention more on Bitcoin than Ethereum, Ripple or any other cryptocurrency out there. I mean that they're laser-focused, because it's the mother of all cryptocurrencies. It's also the main gateway to be converted straight to fiat when withdrawing from your hardware wallet, mobile, exchanges or so. It's just my own point of view though.What do you honestly think about this guys? Cheers!

### Reply 1:
They are focused on Bitcoin because it's the best performer, simple as that. They don't care about the technology, decentralization and all that stuff, alts were hyped because they showed great performance, they looked like the next cool thing, but now that their bubble has popped, many investors have already jumped the ship.

### Reply 2:
I think it out performs than other physical investment opportunities in this world. The best example is Gold. If you had invested in Gold back then when Bitcoin was being faced on an exchange in 2011 with a small amount of $100. Your profit today will be 10 times lesser than those invested their money in Bitcoin.

Topic: Portuguese government is planning lottery with invoice bills
### Original post:
The Portuguese government has announced a lottery, starting in January, to encourage people to ask for invoice receipt when they buy something.The invoice bills are numbered and one of them wins a car if the number is the same as the random number extracted. This lottery will be every week: a car given every week to a random invoice ownership.<link> suppose the governments are thinking ahead in ways to tax in the future if bitcoin goes mainstream.I think this will try many people and encourage them to always ask for the receipt.

### Reply 1:
Yep, I'd say it is to encourage people not to do cash jobs / black money jobs. Similar to bitcoin, cash can be transacted person to person without oversight, so it still won't stop it.They can't try to ban cash either.

### Reply 2:
I dont think this has anything to do with Bitcoin per se, just tax evasion in general.Portugal is one of the harder hit areas of the economic crisis. The P in PIIGS is Portugal.

Fun fact du jour...Bitcoin on Wednesday moved from $13.95 at open to $13.96 at close on Mt. Gox. This was a change of under .1% <link> the same day, US Dollar index fell 0.42% (decent plummet after Bernanke announced more money printing... ***I'm so shocked***). <link> Bitcoin was less volatile than the mighty US Dollar. Anecdotal? Sure. But nonetheless quite interesting, no?

### Reply 1:
Or something fundamently right since the price of BTC in USD is not dependent on the value of USD......and if that would affect it, I'd suspect it would lag due to the Mtgox hub being however many hours ahead there in JP.Edit; BTC is up .50% from previous close right now....

### Reply 2:
Long-term, in a mature market, you'd be correct. But BTC is not traded on the global forex markets with the type of liquidity needed to display that type of correlation just yet...Maybe in 3-4 business days, after the Dwolla transfers, we'll see the .42% increase we expect

Topic: Some notable events in Bitcoin history
### Original post:
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency created using blockchain technology. It is currently the best known and most mapped cryptocurrency. Following are examples of some notable events in Bitcoin prices and events at different times: 1. Early Price Recovery (2009): Bitcoin was first published in 2009 by an unknown person named Satoshi Nakamoto, the founder. Bitcoin value is usually measured in terms of US dollars. Generally it was still of very low value.2. First Transaction (2010): In 2010, a New Zealand man made a 10,000 Bitcoin transaction to order a pizza at Jamia. This event is the first time a mapped transaction has occurred. 3. Huge increase (2013): In 2013, the value of Bitcoin experienced an extraordinary increase. At this time, the price of Bitcoin reached the highest price for the first time. 4. The beginning of good times for Bitcoin : In 2017, the price of Bitcoin showed a wonderful flight. At this time a price hike went up to 20,000 marks until tomorrow. It was a time of incredible profits through Bitcoin and became known as goodwill in the crypto market. 5. Administrative settlement (2017): In 2017, the Chinese government issued a controversial settlement on the valuation of cr<rest of post truncated>

When we are discussing about notably event on bitcoin history i expect you to dive more into the bitcoin Halving which normally ofcourse every four years, which next year 2024 is the next one where their will be a bullrun ad the price will shift to achieve a new all time high, also in addition, i expect more discussion on all time low as well to consider them with the all time high over the years and so many additional researches with a chart proof comparison in analyzing the difference over years.

Topic: How to securely store your Bitcoin
### Original post:
Hi Everyone,Since there will be a lot of new investors coming into the crypto space in the coming weeks. I wanted to make sure I publish an article about how to properly secure your Bitcoin. I would appreciate it if you shared this article with anyone you know who is getting into cryptocurrency for the first time. We don't want anyone to lose their funds, so security should continue to be the number one priority for educating new investors.What Is A Crypto Wallet? How To Securely Store BitcoinLet me know if you have any questions or comments on the article!

### Reply 1:
How to securely store your Bitcoin should completely or accurately be about privacy and security, but your article is more for beginners to just know about bitcoin wallets. Also, I do not see any reason for metamask wallet or DeFi to be included if truly you want the article to fit into this board. In my opinion, you do not really specify on privacy, security and safety which should be your focus. Exodus wallet has never been a recommended wallet on this forum as well.

### Reply 2:
That article, easy to get from internet searches, I thought the topic of a safe wallet for storing bitcoins, oh, it turns out how to store it.I often see the same topic in this forum, I'm not sure whether the article was followed or not.Example: Topic: GUIDE: Securely storing large amounts of bitcoin (brain wallet/paper wallet) Topic: Best way to store Bitcoin safely ? Topic: How to keep the BitCoins Safe? Topic: Securely Generating Bitcoin Addresses for UsersI think the percentage is very little to read and do as said in the article, generally, people keep their Bitcoin safe depending on where they invest, because we have a community all over the world, so different countries and exchanges have different ways of doing security.

### Reply 1:
As a researcher who often claims things and listens to claims of peers, all I can tell you: never trust a scientist. Long gone are the days of scientific method and integrity. There are solid facts and statistics showing that only 10-30% of published academic research can be reproduced. The morale of the story: be very reserved, and don't fall for it easily.Here's an exercise for you: whenever faced with an article making grandiose, game-changing claims (curing cancer, developing new computing technologies, etc.) - make a note of it. Few years later, check on the status or even existence of these claims.

Is it possible that this was the result of not broadcasting it until they mined a second block?

It's most likely a poorly configured bitcoind node or pool software. This used to be common among some pools that sent blank work templates at longpoll in order to reduce any overhead of building up a new block. However, that really isn't needed these days.

I don't see how can you ask if we're in a ""crypto depression"" when the exact opposite has been happening for months. Bitcoin has risen in price quite a lot recently and even a bunch of altcoins (especially some that are very well known, or are at least the most used altcoins) had quite a reasonable increase, price and volume-wise...

### Reply 2:
That is true. There are so many crypto currencies at this point. But that doesn't mean each of those currencies doesn't have a chance to rise. Maybe there are top crypto currencies that is really soaring higher but those currencies have also experienced a depreciation. This wont take long. Crypto cyrrencies have so much to offer for us.

Topic: What makes the bitcoin price stronger in the market?
### Original post:
There are aspects that make bitcoin users more and more convinced that bitcoin is a good place for investment so now bitcoin prices are rising in the market!

### Reply 1:
Bitcoin's price is going strong, but not as strong as the alts in the market. Altcoins' price are shooting through the roof. It doesn't matter which alt you pick. Most of them have given phenomenal gains in the last 2 months.

### Reply 2:
I think the price is going up because of its strong there are many created every time. the amount of it is too many that companies want to buy it then creators would want to increase it because the demand is high. Moreover its like most transactions can now be used with bitcoins. Bitcoin is now even more and more recognizable in the world wide web.

### Original post:
Hi everyone, I am just now in the process of making my first bitcoin purchase.For all purposes I have decided upon putting the coin(s) in cold storage and refrain from using any of it for the time being. Having read multiple guides on paper wallets I just wanted some help to see if the steps below are appropriate.1. Coin will arrive in a blockchain.info hot wallet from exchange. 2.

### Reply 1:
I would choose bitaddress.org to print my paper wallet.Either way, on bitaddress.org on the last tab you can verify the key pair by putting your priv key. If it shows you the correct public key, you are good

### Reply 2:
Do not do this, it will make the funds accessible from your blockchain account. As mentioned, you just need to pay the coins from your blockchain account into the paper wallet address with just typing the address in...testing the account with a tiny transaction is also a good idea.

Some people would like bitcoins to be more tangible - see for example this thread and the associated youtube video... <link> there is a scarce, indestructible and ownable (if not quite ""tangible"") resource present in the bitcoin system, and it helps to have a term that refers specifically to this - I propose Bitium (symbol Bt)The name is chosen to resemble a chemical element, to make this concept as tangible as possible for the doubters.Bitium is the resource which we mine and exchange, bitcoins and Satoshis are merely two of the units of Bitium, there may be others in future.

### Original post:
<truncated> is a digital form of currency that not controlled by any government or any central authority.In crypto, there is a high rate of return as compared to the real-estate. Cryptocurrency is decentralized (not controlled by any authority or any government). In crypto, u can trade at any time according to the condition of the market you can trade for a long or short period of time. As you wish. But in crypto, the price can swing at any time because any good or bad news is able to change the <truncated> estate investors are those who purchase property to make profit. They buy residential, commercial or invest through funds. They make money when the value of the money over time increases. Real estate provides us with a physical asset that can provide us security and stability as compared to cryptocurrency. Real estate property has high potential as compared to crypto to increase its value after a period of time.Which one do you prefer?

### Reply 1:
Well I do not not see anything wrong with real estate as it has proven to be a good investment opportunity. However, making this comparison in a Bitcoin forum actually seem out of place and shows lack of faith on your side. Nevertheless, if I am to give my opinion, I feel more comfortable with Bitcoin given the ease, comfort, little startup capital and huge profit potential it holds. In addition, the risk in Bitcoin is relatively low compared to real estate as one is completely in control of his investment without any interference.

### Reply 2:
You are right in mentioning that real estate has the potential to accrue over a long period of time as compared against Bitcoin which has a fixed number of 21million, But remember that a land ceases to be yours after 99years and whether you like it or not, if a government of the day decides one morning that the land looks to be obstructing pedestrian way or they want to use that place for something else, it can be demolished the next day with little to sometimes nothing as compensation. Or, the land can be a swampy area.Everyone has his or her preference but if I were choose, I'd go for crypto investment. There's no business that's without risk, bit I'd rather have my privacy maintained when trying to conduct a transaction, than have myself be the puppet of the government.

### Reply 1:
Yes, with exception that governmetns and banks control fiat. And they wont do anything to ban fiat. Why would they? they can print it at will and do whatever they want with it.They dont control bitcoin, they cant print bitcoin, and they can cheat with bitcoin. This is a reason you see lots of negative press about bitcoin. Banks and gavernments dont want ppl to use it. Thus, the easiest way is just to scare ppl that bitcoin is only used by criminals or it is a scam.

I would have to agree and say it is involved on the same way any form of currency is, the majority of news about bitcoin tells us as much.

Topic: Lost bitcoins - a bigger flaw than originally thought?
### Original post:
Having used the search facility a bit, all the discussion on lost coins seems to be focused on its only a bit, and it will make the rest more valuable so its not an issue. However, I think there is a problem with this thinking.All physical currencies have a percentage that are lost. Its generally around 2-3% per year, and mostly effects the smaller denominations.If we have a situation where we know there will only be 21 million coins, eventually, all the coins will become lost.As things were, when you had so many coins that thousands are needed to buy a pizza, then that's when even the biggest denominations are worthless enough to lose. You also have the issue with losing wallets and that whole learning cycle that early adoptors suffered.As the mainstream start using the coins, they too will lose a few coins as they get used to the security needed to not lose this new currency.Assuming a 2% lose per annum, within 20 years, half of the total number of coins will have been lost.Does anyone else see this as a problem, or is the idea that because the coins can be split down, there is still enough currency to be used by everyone on the internet - for ever?

### Reply 1:
His maths might be off but it's trueWe start with 21 M (assuming no coins are lost until all coins have been mined)Year 1 : 21MYear 2: 20.5MYear 3: 20.1MYear 4: 19.8MThis could in theory continue until we are down to 1 Bitcoin and everyone is trading in 0.0000000001s for a new Ferrari, its true though the loss of coins with no coins being added is a issue, even if only 0.5 BTC were added a year it would still help to combat the loss of coins..Although, coins are not actually lost they are just inaccessible ie the owner has forgotten his password, so I assume there will be a big business in tracking down lost BTC and recovering them in the future especially for the wallets of innovators who might have hundreds of coins stashed away and at $40 USD for 1 BTC I wouldn't mind finding one of these accounts even now

### Reply 2:
It is said that people can't think exponentially, but they also can't think asymptotically.In 2013, John Doe I. may lose his 400 USD or 10 BTC wallet.In 2014, John Doe II. may lose his 400 USD or 1 BTC wallet.In 2015, John Doe III. may lose his 400 USD or 0.1 BTC wallet.

It was standing at 98,120,057 TH/s on September 22nd at 5:30 AM, which then dropped to 67,383,654 TH/s within just 24 hours! For the same period, the median transaction confirmation time has increased to 13 minutes which is highest as compared to the last two month's statistics!

You can check the current percentage at : <link> is currently 8% which is low If we take in consideration that we need to have 95% but It's increasing daily, do you think we are going to reach it or there is no chance and SegWit won't be activated ?It's an open discussion so feel free to say your opinion about the whole SegWit thing and not only about Signalling.

### Reply 1:
in short.dont expect it by christmas

### Reply 2:
Most blocks in 2016 interval were mined before the signalling has begun. So you just don't have that statistic yet. Imagine 100% of blocks flag support of segwit. 2016 blocks average would be 41-42% now, it would however reach 100% in several days. With current ~20% segwit signalling blocks, 2016 blocks average will stabilize around the same value: ~20% in several days, it won't go higher, unless short term average goes higher.

Topic: Phishing warning: Tor hidden service claiming to be Instawallet
### Original post:
I just got alerted by a user, that there is a tor hidden service at the address <link> which claims to be Instawallet. From what I can tell, it always displays the same Bitcoin address: <truncated> .This is _not_ the real Instawallet server! Instawallet does not run a tor hidden service and the only way to access the real service is through <link> .

### Reply 1:
On a side note i found mybitcoin hidden service site is still up, with the claim form and everything lolNot much you can do besides warn users. But don't do like Mike Caldwell, and mail a warning to the mtgox leak list or else you'll get a shitstorm of morons bashing you for trying to protect them from being scammed.

Topic: Why Bitcoin wont hardfork like Ethereum
### Original post:
Note: Jiang Zhuoer released an op-ed to refute the words that Bitcoin might split like Ethereum. He said in the end the market will determine the fate of minority chain.TL;DR1. The minority fork of BTC needs to burn 200 million Yuan to survive.2. The mining industry has the motive, determination and ability to kill the minority fork.3. If necessary, the mining industry will adopt a more moderate transition method.4. Change POW = ostrich policy, change the POS algorithm = Taiwan to give up the seats in the United Nations.5. Essentially the market, not the mining industry, decides to kill the minority fork.<link>

### Reply 1:
good article, i liked it.my opinion which i think is worth mentioning here is that the mining industry is not stupid enough to fork without consensus, meaning without the majority of hashrate supporting a single thing. it is simply way too risky move to do. imagine a split happens and one of the chains' coins be worth a lot less. this simply means they are losing 12.5BTC to 14.5BTC (depending on fees) worth of revenue. and depending on how low that price would be, they can potentially lose a lot of money on each block. now considering they mine multiple blocks each day this loss is also multiplied each day and sums up to a big enough $$$ number that will definitely make any person with smallest of brains think twice.

### Reply 2:
Weird, and onedimensional rant from 8btc IMHOAs if the mining industry would be able to 51% attack the smaller chain forever.....LOLThey would have to permanently keep tabs on the smaller chain, putting their larger chain at risk. Also who would stop the smaller chain from changing the algorithm to something else? POS? Or anything besides SHA256?Then the miners are fucked and would be stuck with their inferior BUcoin and expensive hardware forever.I guess all this bullshit will just make ETH, PPC, DSH, XMR and LTC prices explode if the shit really hits the fan

Topic: Different Between Bitcoin and Fiat currencies
### Original post:
The traditional fiat currencies used in the world like Euro, Pound, USD, etc. are governed by a central authority or government bodies of the respective countries. This means they are centralized. Moreover, all the transactions done electronically will be processed through banks who will be charging heavy fees in return along with taking substantial time to process the transactions.This is not the case with Bitcoin as it is completely based on a decentralized which is operated by the communication and co-operation of the participants taking part in it.As the network is distributed across the globe, the transactions at any time will go through even if some part of the network goes offline.

Topic: Peter Schiff: Gold vs. Bitcoin
### Original post:
<link> his point is that gold has intrinsic value, while Bitcoin doesn't, and that most of the BTC is being hoarded and not actually used in commerce. This leads him to believe the price is highly inflated.

### Reply 1:
Well he's not wrong. Bitcoin has very little intrinsic value. It does cost resources to produce. But the product of those resources is just tons of giga-hashes and the appropriate hashing equipment. Maybe if Bitcon's proof-of-work was something useful that would be a different case. Then maybe people would want Bitcoins for their own usefulness.Also there's no doubt that people are entering Bitcoin mostly because they're expecting the price in the future to be higher. Definitely not because there's a lot you can do with Bitcoin at the moment, because there isn't. In fact, adoption by merchants seems to be the biggest thing the community is trying to achieve. So that means the bulk of Bitcoin-wealth right now is speculation. And that definitely spells a bubble.

Topic: Maybe BTC wont last because NO ONE really profits from it...
### Original post:
I look at BTC as the greatest thing for our world. We need digital currency. It makes sense. But, we live in a world where we are driven by greed and profit. So with that said....If someone creates a ALT coin to compete with BTC for first place, I think eventually that ALT coin will get there. Because at the end of the day, if that 'ALT COIN"" makes enough money they can continuously push their ""ALT COIN to surpass BTC. I dont see anyone financially backing up BTC. I see Bcash and their owners making deals.I see Ripple making dealsI see pretty much everyone else making deals And pretty soon those deals that these ""ALT Coins"" are making will eventually climb them into the #1 spotPLus, people are shorting BTC all day long. It sucks, because im the ""buy during the dip"" guy.my opinions only.... im ready for the backlash

### Reply 1:
Actually the insiders of crypto world and financial traders doing enormous profits with bitcoin, especially during the January bubble. The ones who got loss were all the newbie entering the market to get moon. An alt coin could rise over bitcoin? Why not. But btc is like a standard, a value reserve as gold, a measure unity, so its position is pretty strong imo.

### Reply 2:
your problem is that you think bitcoin was created so that you can make money/profit from it which is why you think if there is no profit in bitcoin or there is more profit in an altcoin bitcoin will die!but that is wrong. bitcoin is created to be a decentralized currency and when it does that it stays alive and strong. and the fact that it is rising and giving you ""profit"" is because it is a currency and majority of its adoption is because of that.

Nice share man but from what I understood , she didn't mean it with a nice way. ""you know about bitcoin? It's untraceable... and now this (paying with a real Apple)"" , for some reasons I felt like she is against it. Still , those who don't know about Bitcoin and watched the video will probably google about it. so It's a win win

Really nice prank Actually that grandma's and his supposed granddaughter's face was blurred in video don't know why they have done it. Could that be request by grandma not to show her face or either channel have done that by themselves. It seems grandma loves privacy..

Do you agree to this ? The news said that the tighter rules is about anti-laundering in digital currency.

### Reply 1:
Can you sight your sources?If there is then so be it if they can really tighten the rules of every user that using Bitcoin in the whole world maybe they will create a 'Digital Police' or a 'Digital Prosecutor' in able to this, or this an another news that keep on repeating almost every month. The real essence of Bitcoin is a decentralized crypto currency meaning no one is in control but if they will place some in authority that will keep on controlling it I think that is impossible for it to regulate plus how can you really tell who is the real money launderer if you don't know the real information of that bitcoin address unless it has given but its owner so does this mean that exchanges or bitcoin developer will show now the identity of each user.

as i mentioned above:Talk =/= Rulesthere is always a lot of ""talk"" in these circles, many against bitcoin many for it and sometimes indifference. but as long as they are just ""talk"" nothing is going to happen.

At the time MtGox was started up, Jed was the person best able to do this. At the time MtGox was taken to the next level, MagicalTux was the person best placed to do this.As for the future, that will depend on how MagicalTux extricates his business from this situation. MtGox might emerge stronger than ever, or it might have blown its credibility enough that it never fully recovers.But MagicalTux, and Jed before him, were always doing stuff that was good for Bitcoin.

Two reporters, Angus Berwick and Ian Talley, recently wrote an article titled Hamas Militants Behind Israel Attack Raised Millions in Crypto.The article claimed that Hamas and their affiliates raised approximately $130 million in cryptocurrency donations. For obvious reasons, this would be very concerning if it was true. That is a big if though.Elliptic, the platform that the Wall Street Journal reporters allegedly used to come up with this analysis, came out publicly yesterday and said that the analysis is wrong. In fact, the Elliptic team wrote in a statement there is no evidence to suggest that crypto fundraising has raised anything close to this amount, and data provided by Elliptic and others has been misinterpreted.That should be the end of the story, right?Unfortunately no. More than 100 lawmakers came together to sign a letter to national security leadership calling for a crackdown on cryptocurrencies. What was their argument? That the Wall S<rest of post truncated>

It is just too obvious that the government and its people dont want the legalization of bitcoin neither do they want the consensus of decentralization in which it operates. This is not the first time we have been hearing many negativity being attached to the name of bitcoin and it continues always. Before the coming of bitcoin, fiat was used for many illegal purposes and that hasnt stopped till date. Both of them are being used for good and bad purposes but that doesnt mean we should dislike or give a negative and permanent thought about them in which it was not what they were built on to do.

### Reply 2:
This is nothing more than a smear campaign against Bitcoin which the government and other mainstream media always does and this time it has utilized the ongoing conflict to gain more traction. There were wars, terrorism and illegal funding long before Bitcoin's presence and they are trying to link terrorism with Bitcoin & crypto to tarnish it's image and to create some sort of fear in people's mind about crypto. It's better baseless as usual, They will fail this time as well like they did in the past and it's a failure ont heir part that they didn't speculate this and had proper Intel about the conflict and now trying to shift the blame over crypto currency. These conflicts are happening for over 50 years and we should question the. that if crypto is used as a medium to collect donations then what was the medium which was used for terror funding before existence of crypto. We just need to ignore these news as people with even slightest common sense would understand the intention of this news as they used similar claim for isis as well.

The indian court banking stays by its earlier restrictions of banning the transactions of crypto currency.

Topic: BIP: ?? Gradual Changing Block Rewards
### Original post:
BIP: ??Title: Gradual Changing Block RewardsAuthor: Slim PickensStatus: DraftType: Standards TrackCreated: <truncated> <truncated> BIP proposes for block rewards to decrease more <truncated> four years the block reward for bitcoin is cut in half. There is much uncertainty surrounding bitcoin prices and total network hashing power before and after these reward reductions. This author feels very confident that bitcoin will traverse its first block decrease with success; however, months before and after will be full of large price swings with a potentially modest decrease in global hash rate. Stability has yet to be one of Bitcoins virtues; yet, many hope (including the author) that this will change over time. The goal of this BIP is to avoid the frenzy in price fluctuations and global hash rate during these rare events by making them much more frequent with smaller decreases. SpecificationBlock rewards will begin decreasing every two weeks starting at the end of the second year of the 25 BTC block reward (Whats the specific block number?). (Note: How frequent the changes are and when it goes into effect are open for debate). Unfortunately, this author is not into coding Bitcoin so th<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
I like it. The adjustment would be roughly 0.6% decrease in reward per difficulty adjustment (2016 blocks) to correspond to a 50% drop every 210,000 blocks.. I say roughly because only looked at the % difference over 210,000 blocks. The ""stair step"" effect means the actual decrease is smaller. Halfway through next difficulty adjustment is is block #315,000 but that isn't a difficulty change block. The 150th difficulty change is block #302,400 which might make a nice round number.Still it is mostly academic. It is nearly impossible to make protocol changes even modest ones. Hopefully some alt-coin incorporates a continual decay function into the the block reward where reward is simply computed based on the height of the block. Going from x coins to 0 coins in exponential decay over the timeframe desired.

### Reply 2:
We still are at the beginning. I agree with your objection to many large changes to the protocol - undermining the trust that the currency can be trusted long-term would be very damaging - but in this case I don't see much harm. It results in the same amount of currency in the end, just with a smoother distribution.I like the way this proposal is written: let's see how big the disruptions are after the first reward drop and plan to switch to a better function if it looks worthwhile.

### Original post:
A small infographic pointing out the famous bitcoin/blockchain companies outside of the US.Original Source of the article I found through this Fb page : <link> infographic creation is their courtesy.

### Reply 1:
The UK is a great place to set up Bitcoin companies, because it's ridiculously easy to register companies in the UK - it takes like 10 minutes and costs 12, which is why all the Ponzi schemes advertise being UK registered. I think that Blockchain.info's actual offices are in Luxembourg, so it's interesting that they're from the UK (or at least are registered there).Plus, the Government is fairly neutral on Bitcoin like the US, except you can trust them a bit more not to be secretly trying to destroy you

### Reply 2:
Maybe because bitcoinfinex is an exchanger that is why it is not included, these are bitcoin companies.

Topic: If Facebook Can Be Worth Billions, Why Can't Cryptocurrencies?
### Original post:
very nice articleIf Facebook Can Be Worth Billions, Why Can't <truncated>

### Reply 1:
Bitcoin is still a growing venture. What is the difference between bitcoin and other businesses like as u mentioned facebok, is that it doesnt have limitlesa expansion, which actually is a good thing. There is a cap fixed over number of bitcoins that will ever be issued. This maintains the flow and doesnt lead to any inflation. Now this may appear as a vague comparision. But we all remember yahoo, orkut and many other social networks which dont really have a solid existence today. Thats because its such a vast industry that as soon as a new and better equipped service comes on the game, its over for the older ones. Here in cryptocurrency market, firstly bitcoin itself is the first of its kind, secondly the anti-inflation cap is also there. These favtors will help it sustain a better position for a very much longer time. Also its not something where people just pass their time but its an investment platform of its own kind. So definetely its going to be huge in the future, unless governemental issues dont persist.

### Reply 2:
I think it's not accurate to compare one social network and all cryptocurrencies. And I think that main difference is a numver of users. If I'm not mistaken, Facobook have more than 2 billion registered users. How many people are using cryptocurrencies? Not sure, maybe tens of millions. Just imagine how much Bitcoin and ofher cryptocurrencies would be used by, let's say - 0.5 billion or 1 billion. Then only Bitcoin without other cryptocurrencies would be worth more than Facebook. And there is another thing - after recent scandal, Facebook are loosing it's value.

How about the Bitcoin Foundation producing a leaflet in various languages that enthusiasts could give to shops and small retailers? (Maybe it could be sponsored by BitPay?)I have quite often mentioned bitcoin to various local shops, but what I really need is something I can give them that explains it clearly. A good multilingual leaflet listing all the pros for retailers would I'm sure do wonders for adoption (e.g. no fraud, no fees, easy daily conversion to fiat if required, unique selling point, enthusiastic buyers etc)

Topic: What if dev-team is compromised?
### Original post:
Suppose someone accidentally the whole dev team? Or suppose it is infiltrated? Or suppose they are bought off?How should we as a community react? Probably fork right, but what fork? It is easy to imagine a dozen forks springing up before things stabilize. In a worst case they could be so weak, the original, comprised chain becomes the favored one, simply because it is easier to stick with the status quo.Maybe we could benefit from a chain of command or something?

### Reply 1:
While the dev-team is brilliant they don't equal Bitcoin. The community doesn't always go for what the dev-team suggests. In fact sometimes there are differences of opinion within the dev-team. Also, the dev-team isn't set in stone. Members of the core dev-team can change.This is a strength of Bitcoin being decentralized. There is no single point of failure. Since the entire community benefits from Bitcoin being successful, everyone naturally desires to do what it takes to make that happen. This usually means as long as things are working there is no reason to change or accept any changes. Only changes which can win a large majority of support, what Gavin often calls a supermajority, will usually have any chance at being implemented.

switch to litecoin, its more userbased.

Topic: Why Craig Steven Wright claimed he is Satoshi Nakamoto?
### Original post:
What was the reason Craig Steven Wright claimed he is Satoshi Nakamoto? Anybody know what is the real reason (what behind the scene)?

### Reply 1:
Probably due him wanting to simply gain power over other sort of authority figures in the bitcoin or blockchain space. I wouldn't be surprised if his main intention was to somewhat manipulate people's thinking.

### Reply 2:
I would imagine he has a lot to gain if the community were to believe that he is the Satoshi Nakamoto. The man has basically turned into a legend, coming out of nowhere and disappearing without a trace. The cryptocurrency community has a good amount of respect for him, even using his whitepaper as a basis for arguments like Bitcoin Cash supporters. Lots of people want to find Satoshi, and he probably thought he could exploit that.I personally believe Satoshi can singlehandedly end and stop all these hostile takeovers as people would be much more likely to take his side. He can take Bitcoin wherever he wants to and the community will support him. If Craig Steven Wright could wield this kind of influence, then he could use that to gain fame, fortune, and power. He has since backed off without truly showing relevant evidence, so I would say it's incredibly unlikely.

Sadly bitcoin was first made, and its not created like ETH that has functions like smart contract. Blockchain is an opensource so everyone copied the source code and made improvements to the system, that is why ETH was created to give more functionality than Bitcoin.

Wow, it looks like Asian countries are on a march to regulate bitcoin. In the last two years bitcoin worth 1.92 trillion Won was traded in South Korea. I guess with such a big trading volume the catalyst for Korean government's decision to regulate bitcoin is:Electronic Financial Transactions Act, income and corporate tax thus preventing tax evasion and boosting transparency.Guess a price surge is on the way.

Topic: The Bitcoin Balance of Power
### Original post:
Another hard fork is looming and most probably it would happen in November and Bitcoin would split into two. This hard fork is definitely going to have a much bigger impact than the BCH fork. Since majority of miners are backing the NYA, S2x (Segwit2x), I am assuming if a split happens S2x chain would have a bigger hashrate than S1x (Segwit). Replay protection, difficulty readjustment are a couple of technicalities to be considered before the split.I do agree with Core's PR, rather than having a disruptive split, a smooth transition is a much better option. Interoperable nodes right before the split and then suddenly two chains and then the minority chain having a tough time finding peers. Waste of resources.It could be argued that Core didn't agree to NYA, 2x, or a rushed hard fork.It could be argued that a 2x hard fork wouldn't be claustrophobic to the network or would cause too much utilization of resources or lead to node centralization.It could be argued that the individuals behind NYA want to control the network, bitcoin being controlled by a few individuals.It could be argued that Segwit combined with other scalability implementations including LN are apt scalable solutions <rest of post truncated>

the problem and difference between SegWit2x and BCH is that the first one has the SegWit and also it is a 2 MB block size increase which is not bad at all in my opinion when compared to 1 MB, it is a small increase and when compared to 8 MB it is a small increase which will not lead to node centralization.also I haven't been following things much, so can anyone clarify if core developers are against the 2 MB hard fork or are they against the 2 MB hard fork's time. for example will they be open to 2 MB hard fork at another time like in 6 months instead of 3?

### Reply 2:
I think the next fork/transition is going to be just as messy and just as smooth once the storm is over and we reflect/assess. Hopefully it will dump another coin with a huge MC onto the market that we can all abuse again lol.

Topic: How to make governments accept bitcoin?
### Original post:
I have a question for you. How to make governments accept bitcoin and not see it as a threat? So that one could use bitcoin in daily use, such as paying taxes or grocery shopping. What is there, other than anonymity, thats making governments fear bitcoin and cryptocurrencies?

### Reply 1:
No they will not accept Bitcoins but companies will.US dollars and other fiat currencies will become digital in the future when paper money becomes toilet paper. Just like Bitcoins, digital fiat currencies will be used in the future.

### Reply 2:
Governments won't easily allow bitcoin to be the currency to be used in the country. Other than anonymity the biggest hurdles is that governments can't give the users the assurance of trust similar to the local fiat. Because currency was printed based upon a value placed in relation to commodity. Bitcoin just move depending upon the technology.

Topic: Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index
### Original post:
The Fear and Greed Index for Bitcoin is a good indication of the current market sentiment towards the King of Cryptos and as of May 11, 2019 it is standing at 76 which an improvement of 5 points than the previous update and a great leap from last month's 51. Now, this analysis is quite reflective of the current upward movement of Bitcoin as it is releasing the energy, excitement and enthusiasm in the marketplace. Here is a plot of the Fear & Greed Index over time, where a value of 0 means ""Extreme Fear"" while a value of 100 represents ""Extreme Greed"". Source: <link> isn't it? By the way, this is not my own analysis, and I am not the one making it up.

### Reply 1:
Interesting analysis. Makes complete sense due to the transitions from bear market to bull market and vica versa. There is nothing surprising about any of this since this is common logic. Currently, I feel that the pointer should be somewhere in between(Around 40).

### Reply 2:
""fear and greed"" are not things that can be measured on a chart. you can draw a chart like this one after the fact meaning when it is already too late and the market has already changed its course but never when it matters which is when the investors are leading towards one or the other.that is mainly because these things are being affected by all the things that are going on in the market at that time. for example in 2016 when Bitfinex was hacked the ""fear"" increased and the FUD helped that to crash the price about 30% IIRC. that was not something you could see on the chart but you can see it now that we are past it.besides, market and its participants are not black and white to be able to be categorized like this.

Topic: I helped my dad bought some Bitcoin last night
### Original post:
When I got home last night, my dad and I are eating some chicharon a.k.a. pork rinds while watching basketball on TV. Then suddenly my dad showed to me his iPad about Binance to check if its legit or not. I said that its legit once he installs the correct app and not the fake one. I thought he just wanna install it and explore, but he seriously wants to buy some Bitcoin with his extra money that he didnt need for now. He just wants to try buy and hold Bitcoin. He already knew that I am in this industry for a long while, but yeah its never too late for him to buy his first Bitcoin. I have never convinced or forced him to buy BTC since I started my journey. Hes just being interested in all of a sudden thats all. So I educated him about the basics, managing financial risks, fees, etc., letting him understand and acknowledge that there are no promises or astronomical guaranteed returns. I also sign him up on Binance using my referral link and assisted him in setting up 2FA, KYC, etc. He wanted to buy using his credit card, but I rather have him buy through me instead to save fees since I can transfer USDT to his account immediately on Binance without fees and convert it into Bitcoin. S<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Congrats to you and to your dad for having his first ever purchase of bitcoin. Now, since you're able to educate him and it's likely that he's just going to hold it.I reckon what Little Mouse said that it's now time for him to introduce to those wallets where he's the one holding the private keys. Little by little, a progress like that will make him more aware of how it goes and how to keep his bitcoins safe.

### Reply 2:
Please tell him that he should always go to official websites to find download link. Don't search in stores that is risky with fake applications.Your dad is one of few elderly can change themselves, learn new things and accept new things. Most of elderly hardly to accept new things that they are not familiar with.Please tell him how to backup his account, 2FA setup code and how to install 2FA in another device. Or you can simply guide him to re-adding that 2FA in a same device, by using backup of setup code.I think it is risky for elderly but if you think it is fine, you can tell your dad about risk of storing coins at centralized exchanges and advantage of using non custodial wallets.

I believe a lot of you guys is aware about the video that Blockstream made: <link> still don't know what is it about but do you think we should be excited about this? Some are saying that this is a way to have bitcoin without the need of internet connection, others are saying to run nodes in space etc. I'm not sure about you but I personally don't think it has anything to do with space, I mean doesn't that require millions, If not billions of investment? unless whatever they are going to provide will have fees and will be widely used, I don't think Its something realistic.

### Reply 1:
Blockstream satellite1. No internet required - satellite internet - connecting bitcoin to the people those who have no internet access.2. Cutting down the cost of running full nodes.Connecting your computer to the blockstream satellite is only about $100.3. Network stability<link> concept is simply amazing.

I will be keeping an eye on this one. The video is very interesting, I am not sure either what the video is about but what ever it is, it sounds fascinating. Imagine, Accessing the blockchain without the internet?? Now that would be revolutionary. We live in interesting times in deed.

Topic: Request for Multiple-Step Verification on Bitcoin Sites
### Original post:
With the numerous recent hacking incidents on Bitcoin-related sites, most notably Mt. Gox, I think we need to step up our game in terms of account security. While the break-in at Mt. Gox could probably have been prevented, it nonetheless stands to reason that something like it will happen again, and maybe with more devastating and less reversible consequences. We need a better security system for our accounts.Bitcoin is a currency, and we need to get used to that. Many online banks, stock trading services, and such have multiple-step verification processes, where you must enter a password and a code, whether is changed every thirty seconds and stored on a small dongle, in the case of E-Trade, or sent to you mobile phone, in the case of Gmail. With a system such as this, the financial accounts of Bitcoin users would be much more secure.Mt. Gox, Tradehill, BitcoinMarket, and the like, this is a message for you. Your users want security, and we're willing to give up a bit of convenience for it. Systems like Gmail's are not hard to implement, and are much more secure than a simple password. Bitcoin is not a toy currency, not a simple experiment for fun. Bitcoin is worth real money, and<rest of post truncated>

OTP tokens are cheap (about $8), or you can use mobile phones these days, the code to implement them is opensource... it would be a good idea to at least have them as an option.

Topic: Can the blockchain be a cryptographic rosetta stone for other data?
### Original post:
Since every wallet software has to know the block chain, can it be used as a universal reference for uncoding other information? For example, i have an mp3 that i want to send someone. Instead of sending them an attachment in an email, I send them an even shorter amount of data which goes into a app which uses values in the blockchain to extract the orginal information.I'd love to learn that bitcoin transactions themselves could be used as automated data transfers. So that when a recording artist gets a satoshi(or whatever they see reasonable) sent to specific wallet address, the sender automatically gets to play their song, video, 3d print their vinyl, teleport them thru a usb to perform in their living room. No 3rd party involvement. Sure would solve ASCAP and BMI's problems with pandora.

### Original post:
The Bitcoin Movement is delighted to announce its first VeChain ToolChain powered artist collection of 300 limited edition pieces. Proof of authenticity and product details will be accessible through the Bitcoin Movement app.The collection was designed in collaboration with British rapper and entrepreneur Zuby to create a first of its kind, limited edition streetwear collection. Dubbed Take the Power Back. The collection will officially go on sale to the public on 14th of November at 5pm EST exclusively through The Bitcoin Movements online shop. Only 50 hoodies, 125 Hats and 125 T-Shirts will be available.The prominent design feature of the collection is the number 21 Million which has become a symbolic figure in the Bitcoin community. This number relates to the total number of bitcoins that will ever be issued and is what makes bitcoin one of the most scarce assets known to man. In his own words, Zuby explains I wanted to design a collection that inspires people to take control of their money, whilst empowering and uniting them through participation in the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin is known as the currency of the people and it puts the power back in our hands. Artist and founder of<rest of post truncated>

I too having such opinion as a second thought, no bitcoin logo, the streetwares will be too difficult to be identified for the bitcoin adoption purpose. Also, only 50 hoodies, 125 Hats and 125 T-Shirts will be available, this means it will be so limited, how can bitcoin be known using this means if limited supply of such shirts are available. I also believe now that they are only using bitcoin name for selling their limited supply streetwares at a very expensive price, because I am pretty sure their prices will be so expensive.

### Reply 2:
Focusing on mass adoption yet only releasing a limited number of products for collectors? I'm not hating on them but if they want to name themselves the ""Bitcoin Movement"" I don't think the way to go is to focus the scarcity of Bitcoin but for the mass adoption and the utility Bitcoin will have in the future. Besides that the number ""21 Million"" won't be that recognizable for people who don't know Bitcoin so I don't know why they made this as their main print again focusing on the number rather than actually focusing on Bitcoin being more recognize.

Topic: Bitcoin and me (Hal Finney)
### Original post:
I thought I'd write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.For those who don't know me, I'm Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt t<rest of post truncated>

Topic: Will the Blockchain Endure if Bitcoin goes Bust?
### Original post:
If Bitcoin dies, would the Blockchain network remain distributed and robust ?I've heard more than a few Wall Street Gurus and Tech Visionaries state that while the Bitcoin concept is unique and interesting, the Blockchain Technology is where the magic happens.If Bitcoin dies, then a million despondent miners return whence they came, and the distributed nature of the Blockchain is weakened to an unknown degree. The way I see this, to an average Bitcoin miner, the Blockchain is the lifeblood of Bitcoin and the river from which it flows, but it is consequential to mining Bitcoin, which is the miner's primary objective. Integrity of the Blockchain is essential for mining to occur. Conversely however, if those who would build new platforms on the Blockchain network were the primary drivers of the Blockchain due to the absence of miners, it would be in their interest to control as much of the Blockchain Network as possible. This would effectively neutralize the incorruptible, distributed nature of the Blockchain.If Bitcoin dies, will the Blockchain necessarily die with it?

### Reply 1:
Of course the blockchain will also die. ""Blockchain technology"" only works with the financial incentive of mining valuable Bitcoin. Take that away and only some idealists will continue mining, severely affecting the security of the whole network.The blockchain as ""technology"" depends on Bitcoin, the currency. People that try to separate the two can not be taken seriously.ya.ya.yo!

### Reply 2:
Blockchain without bitcoin = bank vault with no security. Mining secures the network. No bitcoin? No miner rewards, no mining, no security, no network. Get it? Good.

Woow, sounds awsome! In the video they talk about Bitcoin, saying it can store your wallet address to receive payment. Wouldn't it be fantastic if it could store your private key too, thus being able to make payments as well?

Good point. probably since the NFC technology only works on a very short distance (if I am not mistaken not more than a few inches or 8-10 cm), it cannot really be defined as a ""tracking"" system. You usually don't establish any radio communication unless you want to. Am I wrong?

Topic: Cryptocurrency fraud and scams
### Original post:
how they happen and how you need to pay attention to safeguard yourself against them.The Computer Science saw a different phase when cryptography mechanism was introduced with Bitcoin. With this big of a change, threats of fraud increased, to safeguard from these malicious activity is extremely important. Startups without blockchain should not be trusted at all. Before committing to any company, their credentials should be reviewed.There are many fake ICOs that can scam people easily. The best way is to do research before being affiliated to that exchange. Another way is to send an email and ask about the exchange to be cautious. Phishing is another way to scam people, by asking their details and asking them to invest their Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. Fake Airdrops and Punycode are most common tricks. There are many unregulated brokers that can lure clients in lower prices and trading products and fast returns. So, one needs to be vigilant. The automated trading systems are not scams but they will take any opportunity to earn profits. Exchanges will charge an unfair amount to withdraw, the best way to avoid is to already be aware of exchanges price differences. Fake emails<rest of post truncated>

yeah very important for people to identify all this fake project and scam platform, most platform that will encourage people to invest for the sake of helping them to do trading are not always genuine, good thing that i don't pay attention to such platform, it is best to stay away from them, if you don't trust any new project enough to invest, then buy already existing coin in the market, we have enough good ones out there to chose from, cmc can also help in that aspect.

### Reply 2:
Caution is most important and if you don't have any kind of idea and information about something then it is better to stay away from it because of these individuals they surely know what they are doing, prevention is still better in this kind of situation being an individual that doesn't have knowledge with this kind of fraud needs to equip themselves with some information in the past and share what they experience so it will not happen again.

This is exactly why it's harder. All those things you talked about there are PHYSICAL things. Money itself is physical. Now covering a virtual currency that technically shouldn't have any value wouldn't be possible until they do pass some things in congress that would decrease said variables.

we now have bcash and segwit 2x in the pipeline. i'm far from convinced that the 2mb hard fork will happen in the time period they've nominated but let's see. if it doesn't there's a good chance miners will push hard towards bcash. both options rely on bypassing core which is kinda pathetic as they're being bypassed with their own work. if it does pass then what will core do? will they continue to contribute to something they disapprove of or toss their cookies and go get jobs elsewhere?obviously it's a very loose grouping of people but the main ethos has been pretty consistent.

keep a little in there but put most of it into other things. i've no idea about garzik's motives or plans, but nothing put together in three months by a closed shop will cut it.

miners are all on board for 2x. looks like places like bitpay are too.exchanges probably don't care.the only things holding it back are whether the code is good enough.and maybe even that won't be enough to stop it.if it activates then I don't see who's gonna split other than irrelevant minnows.which still leaves the question of what core will do.

Well, some exchanges don't require any proof of who you are, if the amount is small.Some exchanges you can make up your name and email and all that and do a few thousand USD worth of trading per day. So doing that on an exchange really isn't that helpful in trying to ""launder"" coins.Many people mix coins to stay anonymous though. When you do stuff on an exchange it knows who you are and if hacked people can figoure out who you are.Sending stuff to a mixer will help avoid that for the most part, it is almost impossible to figure out who someone is from mixing.

### Reply 2:
honestly, i have never used Bitcoin mixers ever but I am watching them from 2011 when they first came I remember when I made my first bitcoin wallet then it was on a Bitcoin mixer site and they have charged me 0.01btc as transaction fees. where as block chain was taking 0.00001btc fees at that time. I prefer exchanges as I don't have to worry about my privacy much as because no one wants my little bit of money.

A lot of venture capitalists are attracted to crypto world. Even the famous investment bank Goldman Sachs don't want to miss the train of investing to bitcoin's startup.

### Reply 2:
They are looking for new mega trends. The old economy stock exchanges have reached their high, there is no more much potential so the investors are looking for other investment areas...that's why so many millions of venture capital have flowed into crypto coin and fintech startups since a couple of months. Circle is just another startup in a long row...

It is surprising as i thought they would be into bitcoin and all the tech which has been created around it, find it very strange. We need these guys to understand and want to join the movement, they will be a great addition granted they won't have much to buy because of their expenditures but hopefully that will stick and they might create business here or go on to a good job and buy as a investment, they will help no end imho.

Now that BCH has split off from BTC, some guys still want to fork again through Segwit2x, I still dont understand how can people be that stupid to do that again, but it looks like it's just another attempt to hurt BTC in any way they can.As we see more and more censorship on the internet, which is starts to become visible now, they are intentionally pushing for a big block system, where the node count will drastically drop even further.There are 6295 BTC nodesThere are 1715 BCH nodes (roughly)<link> we know for certain that as the 8mb block keeps stacking up, the hardware and bandwidth costs, the node count will drastically drop further.So we have internet censorship now higher than ever + an unsustainable high blocksize = failure.I could not have been more comical than this, and this is the worst timing of this happening.Not only you have net neutrality in danger plus the massive censorship coming, but you also have a rapidly growing blockchain, hardly any merchant support, and the hobbyists who run now BCH nodes could dissapear soon.

Topic: Bitcoin advertising by celebrities.
### Original post:
If the celebrities advertise and support bitcoin it is good for the community because it will spread the bitcoin to their supporters who is possible to become future investors of the bitcoin.The more celebrity will expose bitcoin to the public the more chances to grow the value and it is what really want to happen. Hoping that not only the celebrities endorse the bitcoin but also the government will advertise this coin and Im sure that many people will invest and the price will grow more.

### Reply 1:
Yup, this is more on Cashapp though and not bitcoin. But as the saying goes, any publicity is good for bitcoin. And this is not the first time that we have seen this, 2017 was also the time when we see a lot of celebrities jumping on bitcoin and other crypto, specially those ICO's that turns out to be a scam.This is the financial side of bitcoin, I do hope though that this time, newbie investors will do their due diligence and not be irrational like 2017.

I'm a Muslim and this is such a good news for Bitcoin. Expect the price will jump more because the community might grow and more and more investors will come.

### Reply 2:
This is in fact very good news for the cryptocurrency community, it will grow larger, and be very more widely accepted. Muslims take seriously laws that apply to Islam, so I am quite certain extensive research was done to cover the possibility of this. I think its a win-win situation for all peoples involved, it offers more opportunities for investments in different mediums.

### Original post:
Bitcoin is DownAs you can remember when the virus spread at the beginning BTC price sharply reaching $9,439 on January 28, 2020, and the markets follow the BTC as always many crypto markets rose up, that means coronavirus favor CryptoMarkets first, But what makes Bitcoin price go down As the spread continue people start to panic with the disease not Btc, thinking of many Negatives and some people exchange their Crypto to friendly fiat money so they can cover some emergency staff buys extra food, drinks, masks, etc, the simple view is that many sell result to cheapest sell which automatic kill the prices of an Assets.

### Reply 1:
People who were facing margin calls had to sell of their liquid assets (Bitcoin and Gold) to meet their obligations. Many of these people were ""professional"" investors. Now, Bitcoin is artificially cheap, and real hodlers are loading up before the upcoming massive price pump.

### Reply 2:
So with that logic, obviously the panic about the corona virus is one factor that cause a sharp decline on the price of BTC. Well, you can't take out that there could be whales who take advantage of the situation and play us. Media did also play a part as well, as they reported the spread and probably blow out everything out of proportion. Nevertheless, bitcoin is very strong and resilient, as other markets are still in shock and have difficulty recovering, bitcoin has been bouncing back from $5000-$6500 or more.

What exactly are you trying to accomplish? If someone gave you a unique Bitcoin address, he'll know he only gave it to you, so he'll know any funds received came from you.Or do you want him to think/know only one of the transactions came from you, and the second transaction has an unknown source?

It is no wonder women don't feel welcome in this group.

I believe you all are under the mistaken belief that it was the woman that was invited to be on the panel. Where you went wrong in your logic is that is was actually her Shoes that were asked to be on the panel. The woman, was simply there to facilitate getting the Shoes there in a timely manner. Also, you will notice there is a typo on the screen, it should have said Elizabeth Rossiello's Shoes.

### Reply 1:
At the beginning, the bch price was in the range of $ 150 and rise drastically a few days later even up to $ 900. Media quatz writes the market value of bitcoin cash reaches $ 7.6 billion, it's makes bitcoin cash into cryptocurrency in third after bitcoin and ethereum. However, today's Bch has dropped dramatically and returned to the beginning price about $ 150. This could be due to the current rise of bitcoin price that makes Bch down to the base or because decrease in bch volume on the market, I don't know for sure. This makes people sell the bitcoin cash they have. But It is still too early to know the future of bitcoin cash.

### Reply 2:
I wish I got in on it but I had all of my Bitcoin on an online wallet during the split, so I didn't get any private keys that I would be able to use to get BCC from. They were in the middle of transit to an exchange in case there was an issue with the market during the fork.I was considering dumping back when it was trading around $500 but I realized that I didn't really care, even if there was some money to be had. I wasn't going to get any value of real substance and there would have been very little money made compared to what could have potentially been lost if the market started to take a tumble.

Topic: NASDAQ getting into cryptos, big deal?
### Original post:
Nasdaq has joined the crypto race.It recently unveiled its plan to purchase the Swedish crypto-friendly stock exchange technology company Cinnober. A deal that will cost Nasdaq at least 190m if/when concluded, ideally in 2018,it will be a major step by Nasdaq towards the provisions of custodian services for crypto investments, particularly for institutions. Nasdaq is the second largest securities exchange in the world with a market capitalization of over 10 trillion dollars.It would seem Wall Street are gearing up heavily for a massive adoption of cryptos <truncated> :<link>

### Reply 1:
Fact check:NASDAQ haven't yet acquired it. The have just submitted the bid and expressed interest to buy Cinnober. That's a big milestone yet to be achieved.On 25th April 2018, NASDAQ CEO said in an interview that they are actively exploring options to enter into cryptospace. This acquisition is going to be their first step into crypto economy. Indeed a cheering news.Question:Will SEC allow NASDAQ to operate in cryptospace? Because SEC is reportedly very worried about the safety of public money!! I hope you get the sarcasm!!

### Reply 2:
I do, the SEC hurdle remains a key ingredient, custodian services will not work if there are not enough regulations to protect investors, maybe they anticipate an approval by SEC, politics behind closed doors

Topic: EU Banks Forced to Report Bitcoin-Linked Accounts Transacting Over 1,000
### Original post:
An anonymous Dutch bank employee has revealed that major banks in the EU are applying new rules forcing banks to report, monitor or investigate accounts receiving or sending over 1,000 connected to bitcoin.The anonymous user identifies himself as a bank employee within the Dutch banking system. Referencing a memo seen in the bank offices, the user describes how accounts receiving more than 1,000 from known bitcoin-linked accounts should be subject to increased scrutiny, and reported.

### Reply 1:
It says any single transaction, or series of apparently linked transactions over a total of EUR 1,000 must be reported.How do they work out if a series of transactions are linked and over the EUR 1,000 limit?It goes on to say any account receiving over 10,500 EUR a year must be reported, but not what gap between transactions qualifies them as not being linked.

### Reply 2:
So what European banks are saying to bitcoiners: don't do business with us. As i have posted in this forum recently... the country that is markets itself as a safe haven for bitcoin businesses is sitting on a goldmine.

Topic: The FBI is Completely Wrong about the Size of the Silk Road
### Original post:
I would like to thank those who took the Bitcoin survey. Without your participation in the survey, the FBI would have gotten away with ludicrously, overvaluing the size of Silk Road in an attempt to possibly make DPR look much worse than he really is. Over the past two years, Ive collected and analyzed data from nearly 300 Bitcoin users to estimate the size of the Bitcoin economy how much stuff, legal and illegal, people have bought with Bitcoin. The FBI estimate is that Silk Road was a massive billion dollar black market. Yet, all of the data I have collected, along with research by security expert Nicholas Christin, points to a market a tiny fraction of the size.Forbes reported that [g]iven the current price $140/Bitcoin thats $1.2 billion in sales and $80 million in commissions[1]. This is not just bad economics it is bad math. Of course, the price of Bitcoins has fluctuated from less than a dollar to a high of $300 U.S. over the past two years. Silk Road transactions from even a year ago would have taken hundreds of times more Bitcoin for the same street value of drugs.The first price spike in 2011 and ensuing fervor for the virtual currency left me with a huge unanswered quest<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
They claim to have his personal wallet, but are unable to crack the encryption. Who knows, maybe that's just BS too right along with the majority of the rest of the story.<link>

I agreed with you, FBI was boosting their case by making the number up.

### Reply 2:
Correct, although we have been struggling in the last 3 to 4 months because of government hard stance against crypto and too many FUD popping everyday like mushrooms, it would still make sense that bitcoin can recover and bounce back.But as far as $35K, I don't know if that is possible this year, it's like 5x or 6x of the current price so that is huge amount of money to get into the ecosystem. We need fresh blood to pump the market, but it seems that most of them are just mum and decided to wait it out before investing. But let's see.

what do you think about this topic?

### Reply 1:
I think it depends on the people on how he will handle his life so that he'll became a rich person. BTC is nothing to do in being rich because the hardwork and ofcourse the strategy of the person is the who will make him a rich person and nothing to do with the bitcoin. Bitcoin is just a currency and it will help you in many ways.

### Reply 2:
You should always remember, that if some investment could make you rich in short time, it is related with hight level of risk and could be the way of instant loss). IMHO, it can't be ""instant"" on current price level.

How about some order filling options from these drone-like sites such as tradehill, mtgox, bitcoin7, etc.? Helpful order options concerning bid / offer prices that I'd like to see and shouldn't be too hard to program: good till canceled good till certain time (end of day, etc.) all or nothing order fill option partial order fill accepted option (if not automatically offered) <-- take notice bitcoin7! approved acceptance of selling / buying within a price range instead of at a set price (including within % of a certain price)Make it more like my stock brokerage account, mmmk?

### Reply 1:
I think it would be cool if they had a little dashboard kinda like etrade (i haven't used etrade in a while) But it would show you in realtime how much cash you were making or losing on your purchase.

### Reply 2:
The problem with an ""all or nothing fill option"" is that it doesn't define the limits on the current price. Such orders on the buy side will end up above the current price, waiting for enough sell orders to accumulate. Then they execute all at once, above the market. Is that what you want.Actually, what Bitcoin needs are 1) exchanges that don't screw up, 2) exchanges that pay on time, 3) exchanges with a published set of rules, and 4) exchanges that take financial responsibility for their errors. The current situation is amateur hour.

Hello citizens of bitcointalk,This year there have been many rumors and news articles about Chinese exchanges, also Poloniex exchange, they may be insolvent. The exchanges steal the customer funds and gamble it in the market. The exchanges lose the customer money and cannot pay back. Lots of articles here and here:<link> some example)I'm worried many exchange they would fail this year. I think cold wallet is more safe now if you unsure. Everyone be careful this time.

### Reply 1:
yes the only ones that have been going for ages will be will be here next year unless the price falls/crashes then most will have to close

### Reply 2:
Not surprised at all. Exchanges are completely unregulated and while they do provide a service, they can also do whatever they want with ""inactive"" fund, whether to invest in other structured investment products, high risk investments or just themselves (aka embezzlement). And this should be seen in the context of the high risk - high reward crypto space as well.My only advice is to go in with your eyes open; there's never a perfect risk free world, and by choosing to be in crypto, you have just gotten into one of the most high risk investments in terms of potential fraud, regulatory risk, exchange risk etc. This will eat people alive who do not do their own due diligence, while there are high rewards to be made for the brave and continually informed.And that's kinda fair in the long run.

Topic: We all love Blockchains
### Original post:
It has kind of been building for a while now. For a long time everytime there was news about Blockchains, I thought it was a good thing for Bitcoin.Now there seems to be a disconnect, with other Crypto currencies that shouldn't be names be associated with blockchains, whereas Bitcoin is THE blockchain.I am not sure if it is directly a good thing for Bitcoin, but I don't think it can be a bad thing, so I am undecided overall.

### Reply 1:
Good that you brought this up.There is a reason for it,A few days back I get a call from a friend of mine who works in an American MNC ,he asks me stuff about blockchain ,not bitcoin ,just blockchain in particular.To my knowledge ,his company was working on Iot based projects based on blockchain.Taking that into consideration ,lot of other IT monsters like IBM,Unisys are working on the same projects and hence its significance is rapidly increasing.Did you miss understood blockchain for blockchain.info ? They're not the same thing.

Topic: Any non-bank foreign exchange companies that support bitcoin???
### Original post:
hiI am located in Australia and have contacted a various different companies who specialise in foreign exchange transfers - which offer much better rates than the banks - in order to transfer Australian dollars to overseas located bitcoin exchange(s).The problem is they ALL refuse me the right to send my OWN money to any organisation or individual (including legiitimate registered bitcoin exchanges) connected in any way with bitcoins!The absolute nerve of it disgusts me and makes them even lower scum than the big banks in my eyes!A few such lowlife scumbag foreign exchange companies are listed <truncated> <truncated> some (dumb) reason I expected that these non-bank companies would actually have a pro-bitcoin stance, but instead appear to have their heads even deeper up their own asses than the banks do!So my question to you all is - ARE THERE ANY SUCH FOREIGN EXCHANGE COMPANIES THAT ACTUALLY ALLOW PEOPLE TO USE THEIR OWN MONEY TO PURCHASE BITCOINS???

### Reply 1:
Problem is I need to buy at around spot price which is why I'm trying to buy directly from the Exchanges.My problem is trying to get my AUD into the exchange(s) without having to pay 3% (or more) in bank fees in getting the money in there.Theese foreign exchange companies offer much lower rates, but the problem is they all seem to be spineless when it comes to standing up for peoples' rights to send their own money where they please.

Topic: The Dramatic Decline in the Bitcoin/Dollar Exchange Rate is Good for Bitcoin
### Original post:
As the title states, the decline is good for Bitcoin as a currency moving forward. Why?Initial investors in Bitcoin were able to generate a fortune because of the fact they were in on it before anyone else. These investors were holding back the Bitcoin community by holding onto their Bitcoins to generate as much profit as possible. With this current decline it is all but certain that all of the early investors have cleaned out by now, thereby allowing the currency to stabilize by being more evenly distributed.Another reason this event is good for Bitcoin is that the exchange rate of Bitcoins to Dollars is less important than the stability of the exchange rate. It doesn't matter much whether Bitcoins are $5 or $50 if they are being used as a currency as originally intended. This is because if you are using Bitcoins for transactions then you will pay the amount of Bitcoins that an item you are buying is worth. It is not the Bitcoins that have intrinsic worth. Their worth is derived from the goods and services they can buy. Because of this it doesn't matter if you are paying 5 Bitcoins for a t-shirt or 50 for the same shirt. What is important is that the Bitcoin/Dollar ratio is stable<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
It is extraordinarily unlikely that one, or a few, people could manage to corner a large amount of Bitcoin at these prices without sparking thousands of others to return to buying. At this point in the game no one can surprise the Bitcoin markets in this way because we can all see the orders and only a few Bitcoins are sold at a time meaning as soon as the price starts to rise you will see a frenzy.If this frenzy did happen, however, it would be natural as most corrections need to test upper and lower bounds before stabilizing.

### Reply 2:
I would certainly agree that the problem is people who aren't sticking to their value added expertise...if any. So what are your credentials to be taken seriously? Do you have at least a business education to be talking about this subject?

Crypto future is attached with BTC. If BTC rise more of the coins rises. I the same way, If BTC goes down then most of the coins lose down their value. So the crypto moves with BTC price. If the BTC got legalization then all other coins are also considered legal. The popularity of BTC is increasing day by day. In the same way, some or many of the crypto coins are also getting fame as you see ethidium, Tron, light coin, etc.

### Reply 2:
Ok, but your opinion doesn't matter; as well as mine. You may think that BTC is not a currency, but people will still use it to pay for stuff whether we like it or not.So there's definitely a high likeliness of government central banks to create their own CBDCs. So?

Topic: Is it possible to generate existing BTC private & public key pair?
### Original post:
is it theoretically possible to generate a private key of an existing btc address ?the private key is basically just a random 256bit number, so if I'd know that number I could just create a new private key in WIF form, from which I'd create public key and btc address, or is there something more to this and one 256bit number can have multiple public keys and btc addresses?

### Reply 1:
that number is certanly impressive but there are more atom in the universe than the possible private key, so this lead me to think that in a very distant future sha256 will be brokenfor the OP... it was asked already and it is not possible

### Reply 2:
That really depends on what you mean when you say ""possible"", and how the existing BTC address was generated. As long as the private key for the BTC address was generated from a sufficiently random source, nobody else is ever going to generate the same number. If the private key was generated from something without enough entropy such as a person choosing a password, or faulty random number generating software, then it becomes much more likely that the same private key could be generated.This is true. However, as jordant and Amph have both attempted to explain...2256 is a VERY big number. Much bigger than most people are able to comprehend. The odds of generating the same random 256 bit number as someone else isn't just small, it's astronomically small. It's so small that any reasonable person would consider it impossible.Yes. This is wy it is very important to keep your private keys secure. If anyone else gains access to your private keys, then they can spend or steal your bitcoins.If we are talking about P2PKH bitcoin addresses (the addresses that start with a ""1""), then a single private key can actually be used for two different bitcoin addresses. When converting the random numb<rest of post truncated>

This was by far the worst post I've ever read on bitcoin talk, ever. Congratulations. But yeah, Google wouldn't want to stiffen something that clearly works, especially if they are going to invest in it. If they invest in bitcoin, they are going to do everything in their power to make bitcoins functionality even better and possibly raise bitcoins price to the roof. That is if Google ever does do this; which brings me up to my second point. Where did you get this idea from? Did you read this from an article or something? You didn't provide any evidence of this or anything...

### Reply 2:
Your message is unclear, contradictory, and paradoxical. Your Newbie username is 'hearnshouldburn', you talk about the evils of Google, and in the same breath put forth a message of peace and unity. You say there is enough hate in the world while spreading hatred.I will agree with the other poster, this is probably the worst post I've seen on bitcointalk. So in that way your post is special, but in a 'I wish I had never read it' sort of way. Let's make Bitcoin great again and stop wasting time with nonsense like this.

Topic: Is Bitcoin(decentralization) the end for utopia?
### Original post:
Is Bitcoin the final form for humanity? Decentralization has long been dreamed by all different social models, is there another step to be taken?Can humanity (humans) learn to hang on and manage their finances? Or is Bitcoin an experiment to show that we're not capable of managing our own belongings and do require central authority?

### Reply 1:
So many bitcoiners all around the world are managing their finances easily with BTC, all you need to do is use a self custody wallet, and if you control your keys, you control and manage your funds.BTC is not an experiment, maybe it was when it was newly created, but now it is clearly the only true decentralized, permissionless and censorship resistant currency that people can use with zero need of a central authority.

### Reply 2:
No, Bitcoin is just a history of humanity, humanity will experience and pass the era of Bitcoin when it found a better form of technology. The world is everchanging, just when people thought that going to space is impossible, your thought of Bitcoin as the final for for humanity is answerable by no.And it will be stay as a dream until people don't need government to centralized all things.Humans are capable of learning, there are already people who are capable of managing their finances. There are even lectures and books and how to do that. I do not know why you think human are incapable of such, the world is to huge, we have to look out of our window in order to see some of them better yet to explore the vastness of the world.I do not know what are you trying to convey here, there are people who offer to manage other people's belongings so it means people are capable it is that many are too lazy to do or learn it.

If you are using it strictly as a currency, then the price is truly irrelevant, just as long as it is stable from the time that you purchased the coins, to the time that you are using them to purchase goods or services.The only time price matters is when you are using it as an investment.

### Original post:
Etherbanking (EBC) is an electronic currency similar to Ethereum or Bitcoin . EBC coin is completely decentralized, not controlled by any government organization. In addition, users can earn a substantial return on investment. In my opinion Ether banking is a hybrid platform similar to BitConnec But EtherBanking announces its vast ecosystem in 2018. so I think this is also an interesting investment channel in the near future

### Reply 1:
Do you think the Altcoin MLM platform can survive and develop in the future? Maybe 2017 is a development year for the MLM platform, but it will not be able to survive in 2018. The MLM platform has too many limitations as well as risk, so the HYIP level is high. That is what I think and decide to invest in you.

How about if there's a subject added in school For crypto trading?

Hahaha! what kind of thread is this?. Its impossible to have a subject in crypto trading or currency in school because of the platform of crypto currency it is not advisable to study by our students because the most important thing to study is the major subject that they need to take.

Topic: Why do people still send BTC to the genesis block address?
### Original post:
<link> you can see, there are 999 transactions into this address which is the first ever as far as I know, so this address has basically 66 BTC that are frozen forever. What's the deal?

### Reply 1:
That is actually not correct. The address is a valid address, it just cannot spend the Bitcoin from the GENESIS TRANSACTION. This is because that transaction isn't actually in the unspent outputs database and never will be. All of the other transactions that go to it can be spent because those transactions are in the unspent output database. So actually of that 66 BTC, only 50 of it cannot be spend. The remaining 16 can be spent.

### Reply 2:
Oh I get it. And yeah I don't think anyone that is realistic about it thinks any of those BTC will ever move at this point. Sending BTC there: you can discount that from the total supply of 21 million coins basically.

When BTC price goes up, PBOC released messages that they would ban BTC.When BTC price goes down, someone from PBOC said ""There is space for BTC""!!??Seems like someone is trying to manipulate the BTC price.

### Reply 2:
the PBOC has never been a hater of bitcoin.. this is the same for bolivia and canadabut in both cases it is the media mis-interpretation of bank announcements. the media is trying to manipulate peoples impressionable minds to cause price movements.the banks stance is the same as it was a decade ago, the banks will only offer directly FIAT, you cannot walk into a bank and get a tin of baked beans or bitcoins.what private individuals and private financial companies do is what ever they want. banks love the fact that FIAT moves from bank account to bank account, as long as th FIAT is watched over (regulated)so please understand that bitcoins are free to run wild in china, bolivia, canada, america, UK, europe, australia, asia, africa, nw zealand and everywhere else. nothing has changed.too much FUD has been spread, especially those that say one thing but mean another. such as people who's bank accounts get closed due to not declaring the true intentions of who or why their FIAT is being moved around. the amount of bank accounts being closed due to lies exceeds accounts closed due to a bank being fully aware of bitcoin links by the account holder.i avoid reading coindesk articles. inste<rest of post truncated>

Topic: Bitcoin is the vaccine against the CBDC virus
### Original post:
One of the main digital newspapers in Portugal, presented a very good opinion article about Bitcoin:Bitcoin: a vacina ecolgica contra a pandemia digital (Bitcoin: the ecological vaccine against the digital pandemic)<link> article is in Portuguese, but it is an excellent article that I recommend reading and sharing.Here's a little bit of what's been talked about:If you can't understand some part when translating, say so.EDIT:You can find the article in English here:

### Reply 1:
CBDCs are evil, total control & communism by governments. The thought of them makes me sick. Imagine being unable to buy more meat this month because your social credit score indicates youve had too much so your government controlled CBDC payment is declined. Thats what this whole thing is about, a CBDC twinned with a social credit score for everybody.I will not be a part of the Great Reset, this is why we have bitcoin.

### Reply 2:
CBDCs are indeed evil! With cash, we still had some certain degrees of anonymity. But with CBDC, that last amount of anonymity is gone as the government will have a bird's eye view on its citizens' finances. It will become extremely easy for the enforcement agencies to catch money launderers and tax evaders. But also, it will create multiple issues on a normal person's life. Fully digital economy is a highly risky proposition. Bitcoin and other decentralised cryptocurrencies are definitely going to act as a vaccine to a centralised system where privacy doesn't matter anymore!

Topic: Is the Bitcoin Foundation behind the disappearance of Satoshi Nakamoto?
### Original post:
Satoshi Nakamoto is the true father of the Bitcoin movement to create a decentralized currency. After spending years working on his project he writes a paper describing the essence of a revolutionary new protocol.Gavin Andresen aka Gavin Bell began working with Satoshi to optimize the protocol for the masses.During this time another shady character, Mark Karpeles, uproots his life in France and decides to move to Japan and start an internet company. Why Japan? Shortly after he arrives in Japan Mark buys majority ownership in MTGox. By that time MTGox is trading in Bitcoin and under Mark's control evolves into the world's largest Bitcojn trading platform.But where is Satoshi Nakamoto? As the Bitcoin phenomena takes off we are told that Satoshi gives Gavin the alert key to the technology and somehow gives the rights to the Bitcoin name to a Mark Karpeles. At least that is what we are told by Gavin and Mark. I guess we should take their word for it.Satoshi Nakamoto subsequently disappeared never to be heard from again. Mark and Gavin founded the Bitcoin Foundation and have made millions leading and misleading newbies into a MTGox. We now Know around 0.5 Billion dollars has disappeared<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Conspiracy theories around bitcoin foundation are incoming .Based on fact that he haven't touched his bitcoins in long it shows that he might be dead (I hope he is not).If someone would do anything to him, he would already turn bitcoins to fiat and leave on some nice tropical island.

Topic: Question from newb about accepting Bitcoins for payment...
### Original post:
Hey there,Been reading all I can find about Bitcoin and it sounds really great. I'm super excited about it. I am s/e and in a position to accept Bitcoins in exchange for my services. I want to make sure I understand how I accept them. From what I can see, if somebody wants to pay with Bitcoins all I do is give them my Bitcoin password/key that I got from MyBitcoin.com. Is this correct? Is it really that easy or am I missing something?Also, right now I would tie the Bitcoin price to the dollar, but I am afraid of the dollar inflating greatly. How do I manage the Bitcoin price for my services if/when the dollar begins to inflate greatly?Thank you for your time. Jennifer

### Reply 1:
Not familiar with MyBitcoin.com, but any payment you will receive will require the sender to have your receiving address. This address can/should change. So send your key (not password) to the buyer. As far as pricing services and goods in this kind of market, not sure.

### Reply 2:
Thank you everybody!

Until I actually see a solid statement from them saying they are going to accept bitcoin or actually see them with my own eyes accepting bitcoin I'm not going to believe it until I actually see it happening.

Paypal is one of the most accepted means of payment in the world, if you can pay with bitcoin in almost every ecommerce,yes,this is a huge advantage for bitcoin and its users

### Original post:
What does everyone here think about dropping the term, ""Goxxed,"" and start using the term, ""fractionalized"" or even ""banked""?After all, fractionalizing has been around long before bitcoin and MtGox.

### Reply 1:
Gox was/is a huge part of the early years.Goxed is probably the more common spelling.The word isn't terrible........the damage was.

### Reply 2:
I disagree, ""goxxed"" is a pretty awesome word. It has the right amount of glottal ""pungency"" that allows it to carry the implied negative connotation that is embedded in the word.[On a side note, I chuckle a little each time I hear it because I've been hearing that word for a while (with a completely different meaning) in the semiconductor industry.]

Topic: People who buy mining equipment on ebay, are they CRAZY?
### Original post:
Those prices make no sense.Do they realize that the spot profitability will definitely last for more than a few weeks and it will go down to normal levels. Those people will never breakeven.Also, it seems alot more people think they can run this equipment at home without proper a proper setup? The setting up cost is pretty costly too...especially if u need to remove the noise.This year will see other manufacturers like avalon and ebit churn out new stronger bitcoin miners. It is not just bitmain anymore.This is without adding the risk that new stronger chips from manufacturers appearing...and making old models earn less or <truncated> mining was profitable in 2017 only because bitcoin went up 14 times. That wont be happening in 2018. Btc mkt cap at 200 billion right now, is not gonna go to 2800 billion lol. If total crypto mkt cap goes up by 14x, it would be more than gold valuation as well, again not possible in a year....Those news companies are pumping crazy hype and belieft into new miners via their news articles??

### Reply 1:
What u mean is not profitable lately? It is but it wasnt gonna last. As seen an expected now. The spike caused a craze though

### Reply 2:
Hey, if I were selling stuff on eBay, I'd probably hook it up with some malware so that some % go to my wallets. So that's why I wouldn't buy this off eBay. It's fun being a scammer these days.

Topic: Which software an exchange needs? I'm a dev, wanting to build a resume
### Original post:
I'm a developer, trying to land a job at an exchange. What type of software would an exchange need? Want to build something to use as a resume.Thanks guys!

### Reply 1:
I believe you already know many languages and that won't be a problem, am I right?I think the exchanges would be willing to hire more of an employee these days to work remotely as you know of what is happening today we are facing a health crisis, so signing up will not be a problem at all. Fraudulent activities has not been eliminated, I know we can't do that, but their operations are still big. From the beginning of the year, fraudster were able to steal almost $1.5 billion So I suggests to focus on this area

### Reply 2:
The question is which section you have best knowledge? Probably it would be best what you very well and build your resume on it. I believe most of exchanges give priority about security issue and fix security bugs. Besides that coding exchange algorithm is most important for beginner. All the exchange should monitor their security and backend algorithm. So if you have both knowledge and you are expert on it then likely someone would hire you for develop their exchange. Sometimes I have seen on this forum post about want developers for build exchanges. So keep in eye on the Project Development board and Service section. And you may make a post about service what you can provide. Hope very soon you will get some job.

May I suggest to take a look at Arnhem Bitcoincity. Here in the city center of Arnhem (The Netherlands), there are already over 50 local business accepting Bitcoin. There's quite some bars and restaurants, but also a supermarket, bicycle shop, car/tire service shop, a bakery, some gift shops, some bookstores, a florist, two massage salons, a photographer, and many more. Seriously, Bitcoin is getting mainstream here. See also these articles: journalist from MIT living a weekend on bitcoins and Allen Scott's experience in Arnhem Bitcoincity.

Topic: Encouraging people to adopt Bitcoin.
### Original post:
I've been in and out of the Bitcoin scene since it's start. More and more, over the years, I've been overwhelmingly convinced that it is worthwhile. I believe there is a need to get more people to accept Bitcoin as something very real and useful. It will help with the growth of the community and help to insure the future use and growth of Bitcoin in general if we show people that they can be a part of it. I do not have the money to do something like this alone, but what I do have is passion, tenacity, and of course time. Personally, I see a huge opportunity here and hope others do to.

Topic: Do you have a feeling BTC has slowed down a bit?
### Original post:
After quite turbulent events during the last few years, I somehow feel BTC economy s been slowing down a bit. Maybe people are losing interest after not seeing those price jumps/decreases which we witnessed in the past. I know statistics ll probably dispute my claims but this is just my feeling. How do you feel about it, are people still into BTC?

### Reply 1:
Yes, I feel the same way. Do you think these investment funds which we all expect this year might improve the situation? If not, what can?

### Reply 2:
Yes, I ve been hearing that story for the last 2 years. But somehow I feel there hasn't been many new entrants to the market for the last couple of months. Maybe its me.

What has who written about him? I think your best bet is to just google about him. Is he satoshi? Who knows. Only he can answer that.

### Reply 2:
nick szabo is one of a dozen+ people that for decades have been trying to create a new form of electronic money. nick is not satoshi, but satoshi did utilize idea's of nick, hal finney, wai, and others and it has been noted that satoshi alone had the mindset to seamlessly join the individual idea's into one perfect protocol.although hal finney, nick szabo and others use to talk to each other on the cyberpunks forum nick did not continue along the bitcoin path (chatting on this forum) even when satoshi, hal finney and others did move across. which leads me to believe that nick gave up trying to invent money, when satoshi reached the finish line first. (tail between his ass, in my opinion)so any theories that nick is satoshi, or hal finney or any of the other cyberpunk team is satoshi, can easily be denied purely on the history and evidence that has come to light that their grammar, messages, and actions show that they are all different people and not satoshi.it is like saying that god made US bank notes because reference to christian religion can be found on a bank note ""in god we trust"". and also the bank notes own trust is being aimed at that of god.. but we all know god has nothi<rest of post truncated>

Topic: HOW are bitcoins stored?
### Original post:
Excuse me, Im new to bitcoin. I have tried to read many explanations for beginners for the last days, but there are some basic things that I still cant understand, although I consider them essential to know before I buy my first BTC.I read all the time about storing BTC in wallets (software, hardware and paper wallets) and I cant understand what is meant by that. First of all, how can a virtual ""thing"" be stored? I can see how physical coins, gold, etc. could be stored in a box or safe, but how can a virtual coin be stored in a software, hardware, and even... a piece of paper? I still cant grasp the logic of it. For example, if its just a computer file, then why cant it be copy-pasted and turned into many files?The reason for my question is specifically that Ive read about many cases of stolen bitcoins, and I want to understand what makes it possible or impossible for a bitcoin to be stolen? How Can I buy a BTC and transfer it directly to a piece of paper (supposing I understand how thats done) with zero chance of it being stolen?Thank you very much for the help.

### Reply 1:
""The coins themselves are not discrete things which need storage."" This explanation is good. If you copied your wallet file you'd simply have a duplicate copy of a file that accesses the same information on the blockchain, not duplicate coins.

### Reply 2:
I use electrum (electrum.org). My private keys are derivable from 12 words. If you can safely store 12 words--which means not only not losing them, but also keep them from prying eyes--you can store BTC. Electrum can turn the 12 words into your wallet file, which contains many addresses, and allow spending from them. You can copy wallet files endlessly, but you can only spend a satoshi (one hundred millionth of a BTC) once.

Topic: Bigger Blocks = Higher Prices: Visualizing the 92% historical correlation
### Original post:
This animation is a unique visualization of the historical relationship between the average block size and the price of a bitcoin. Not only do the two quantities tend to grow larger together, the higher-frequency oscillations are often in phase too.The animation was created in Mathematica from empirical (real) data downloaded from blockchain.info. I wrote a simple program to create a true-to-scale static image for an arbitrary month, looped through all the months of Bitcoins history, and then exported the resulting array of images as an animated GIF.The cited 92% correlation is the Pearsons correlation coefficient between the logarithm of the two time series. It is important to take the logarithm so that the correlation coefficient describes how the percent change in one quantity is related to the perfect change in the other.P.S. The green rectangles are supposed to represent dollar bills CROSS-POST NOTICE: This content was also submitted to <link> but I am not permitted to share the link to the discussion over there.

Previously he was a grad student in biophysics at UCSB, where he says a ""gnawing fascination"" with bitcoin led him to software.

I agree with you,Amph.The 1% fee is way to high for a ""famous"" exchange. Regarding the bot vending issue..Hmm.. Maybe he thinks he invested too much time and maybe money to create the trading bot and he only wants to sell it at a very high price that won`t be accessible to the common trader.(maybe he is too stubborn to sell it at a lower price).But it`s just a theory,he may wait for the perfect moment to sell it. Who knows??...

### Reply 2:
Really interesting article. I wonder what % of trade volume is from the bots. I read before that up to 80% of stock market volume is bots, but who knows for sure? In any case it makes me want to learn more about programming.

I just saw this recently on Twitter: America's oldest bank, BNY Mellon, will custody Bitcoin.I think this is one of the reasons for the recent pump and resulted from a new all-time-high above $48,300+.For sure this is just the beginning after Tesla announced their purchase of worth 1.5 billion USD Bitcoin, and some other companies followed, just like this BNY Mellon. I really can't believe this.Do you think that this is the reason for the pump from $44,000+ up to new all-time-high above $48,000 recently?

### Reply 1:
Although this is good because institutional are already unto bitcoin but I'm just alarmed a little bit, we all know that bitcoin owns by know one , every people can buy and sell it but seeing big people holds a lot of bitcoin can affect the market so well, I'm not getting anxious or what but if they gonna sell a large number market will crash people like me who owns little bitcoin can be left behind but I trust them they will not do that because unlike me Bank , Companies etc are investor not just a mere trader, if they will adapts it people can easily invest and withdraw to make it into physical cash, I just hope that government will not make unnecessary move about this thing.

### Reply 2:
If more institutional funds enter the Bitcoin market then the credibility of Bitcoin will be strengthened. It may possibly drive the price of Bitcoin to extremely high in a scenario where this institution competes on who among them has the highest holdings of BTC. If this scenario happens then Bitcoin at $1m isn't impossible at all.

Topic: What makes BTC price so volatile?
### Original post:
What makes the Bitcoin price rise up and down? Not a few months ago, the BTC price hit $19,000 and within few days it started to fall down. What makes the price change that quick?

### Reply 1:
I think the main reason is that bitcoin prices are falling due to supply and demand. These two factors determine the bitcoin price. Bitcoin prices have fallen sharply recently due to the influence of China and Korea, which are adopting a bitcoin policy in their markets. It is possible that many altcoins have attracted quite a lot of investors to give up the bitcoin. So bitcoin prices have dropped dramatically.

Topic: Brazils First Crypto-Finance Masters Degree Launches In São Paolo.
### Original post:
Brazils First Crypto-Finance Masters Degree Launches In So Paolo.Major Brazilian university Fundao Getlio Vargas (FGV) in So Paulo is offering the countrys first Masters degree in crypto-finance, Finance Magnates reported April 12.The program offers specialized education for the crypto industry. Ricardo Rochman, the programs coordinator, explained:It is a market with a profound lack of people with expertise. Cryptofinance has economic and financial fundamentals that are worth discussing, researching, and [being] taught.The FGV Masters aligns with a wider movement in the Brazilian higher education system to embrace digital currencies and Blockchain as part of their study programs. Neighboring University of So Paolo incorporated cryptocurrency studies into the Derivatives unit of its Faculty of Economics and Administration last year. Professor Alan de Genaro, who initiated the move, explained:Some issues have to be presented even though the [student] does not go to work in the finance market. People have to understand which factors are beneficial and which are not suitable [regarding <truncated> months ago, two Brazilian economics students in their twenties, Juan Perpetuo and Felipe <rest of post truncated>

Creation of a national currency and a ""token"" by the government is the last thing any country and the whole world needs.What benefit would Brazil have after launching their own crypto?A centralized coin that would allow the government to freeze all your funds, dilute the coin as much as they want, print it even faster and cheaper than fiat and control and know everything that runs through the chain.I really don't understand what this new hype with learning about crypto at university or college level is.Once you're past the first steps cryptocoins are pretty easy to understand and spending 3 years or more with them is <truncated> another story, that thing ca be improved to a different level and has a lot of <truncated> cryptos, that's one thing I wouldn't want to spread.I saw BTC as a tool that would render Forex markets useless, but now we're creating another mess with altcoins.

### Reply 2:
A good point is that the crypto currencies is turning very popular on entire world and places, even at coleges.It is a good signal that in future the crypto may replace the fiat when government lose the battle against btc.

Topic: What is the heck is a private key...exactly? Someone help please.
### Original post:
Ok. I got the Nano S. The public key is the wallet address given to the exchange where the BTC will come from. The 8-digit code to open the Nano S is the pin. The 24 phrases are used in case I lose my private key...yes? Still not sure what my private key is exactly. I also saw in some places where they said Ledger does not give you the private key. So more confusion.

### Reply 1:
As in any other cryptography, you need a private/public key pair. The public key is used to encrypt, and the private key is used to decrypt messages. So with cryptocurrencies, you sign a transaction with a private key to confirm its validity. The primary function of a hardware wallet is to store your private keys away from anyone. They are secure from hackers because these devices are not connected to the internet. Private keys are often stored in the protected area of a microcontroller, PIN protected and by an optional passphrase, and cannot be transferred out of the device in plain text.If you lose your hardware wallet, you can use the seed phrase to regenerate your private key, or you can transfer your private key to another devce. That is why it is important that the seed phrase is stored in a highly protected area. This is the most important piece of information that gives full access to your funds in your wallet.

### Reply 2:
This is an example of your public key - <truncated> is an example of your private key - <truncated> course, that address has 0 balance and never used, this address created for example purposes)If you want to sign a transaction, you need a private key.your private key is in the ledger wallet, it doesn't show you in PC. the private key is a child key generate from master private key where generated from your 24 seed. so, what the important is you have to keep your 24 seed in a safe world, just it.

Topic: Exactly 10 years ago Someone did a transfer of 184M BTC
### Original post:
Exactly 10 Years ago someone found a bug in bitcoin code that allowed him to transfer 184M bitcoins to 3 different address .source : <link> I even know this ?I know a guy that I've been to school with and he's been with bitcoin since 2010, while I criticized it and ignored it . lately we've been catching up and talk a lot, he said basically someone is probably manipulating the network in different way while we are unaware of.""The 184M transaction was bold, everyone could have seen it. In the real world if A really good hacker would do the job , he would do it without us noticing, it will be under the surface, it might be too late if ever could someone else even notice""I wanted to ask the community what do you think of that ?could there ever be a way that someone else is using the network to benefit his own needs while exploiting some bug in the network we cant even see?or that's not possible and he is fooling me ?

### Reply 1:
It was in the beginning though, but the thing is even during that time, the community is very active and caught this supposedly bug and was subsequently fix in no time.Yes, it's called 51% attack, there was a time wherein one mining pool has the hashing power to do that. You can even read it in the Whitepaper itself, <link> - Section 11 ""Calculations.

### Reply 2:
It's always possible to have a bug and someone with decent knowledge will try to utlize that bug but the one above mentioned is unlikely to happen and even if someone attempts to utilize such bug, the decentralized nature of bitcoin will reject that and they may discover themselves on different chain.

In my opinion community determines the value of the asset, not only in therms of money, but literally in therms of survival of the project in the market.If there's no community, very few people will buy the asset, it can be the best coin or token in the world, but if there's no one that support it, selling or buying it, it wont be useful and will be destinated to fail.This is the main reason for me, why it is very important for Bitcoin and for cryptocurrencies in general to grow as a community, but also people to study crypto and to learn a lot and help one each other in order to develope and mantain this new crypto culture that believes that things can change, that prosperity is possible for everybody in this world.If we are able to grow not only in therms of number of crypto users but also growing in quality and personal developement as members of a community that believe in what is doing and understand what it is happening, we will be able to face problems, bans, fear, fud, fomo and all the scammers and nocoiners that are against cryptocurrency and have not understood this great opportunity for the entire human kind.There will be always people against bitcoin and cryptocurrencie<rest of post truncated>

Why those OG's didnt sold their bitcoin? Case to case basisIf someone do still have access to their coins then its simply; They do tend to hold forever whether for Profit reason or for its utility or showing the support Target price hadnt met yet They dont need money yet? For those dormant accounts or doesnt have any activity since. Lost keys? Dead owner Totally forgotten that they have BitcoinIf i were you, then it would be just that better if you dont mind much about those non touched coins or wallets.We dont know on what happened into their respective owners. One things for sure though that if the time comes that they would be having access or getting in touch with their coins then its neither they would be selling off for profits likely.

### Reply 2:
What if I mined or bought 1000 bitcoin and they are in 5 addresses and on 5 different wallets. Assuming 800 bitcoin is in 4 addresses and wallet and I sold it and it remains just 200 bitcoin on one addresses or wallet. People can say I have not sold bitcoin before because my last wallet has not sold bitcoin but that does not mean that I myself have not sold bitcoin before. You can not link all the owners of bitcoin to all their addresses and wallets.

So I take a backup of my computer and I have some BitCoins in there. What will happen to it all if I restore the backup with the same data? Obviously there will be a bug, as the same money cannot exist two places at a time right? Just curious to what is going to happen.

### Reply 1:
A wallet does not contain any coins - it cointains the private keys necessary to spend them. The information about the coins themselves is stored in the network.If you use the same wallet in two places, the first to spend it, gets it.

### Reply 2:
Are you restoring the backup onto the original system or onto a second system? You do not want to run the bitcoin client from copies of the same wallet simultaneously.

Topic: Can a Bitcoin bank be secure and trustworthy?
### Original post:
I've been thinking a lot recently about the challenges of creating a secure and trustworthy Bitcoin bank. I think this is a hard problem and one which presents a challenge for the wider adoption of Bitcoin.WHY BANKS ARE NEEDEDStoring bitcoins safely is challenging even for technically savvy individuals (who have to think about multiple backups, wallet size, password strength and the like) and even harder for everyone else. If Bitcoin is to be adopted widely, most people will want to (and should) store bitcoins somewhere other than their own hard drive and/or a flash drive buried in their garden. Furthermore, it would be challenging to scale Bitcoin to encompass all transactions between invididuals. So it seems likely that most people will store bitcoins in banks and that most transactions will be resolved between these banks without using the Bitcoin protocol itself. At the end of the day, banks could use the actual protocol to resolve any balance discrepancy. Of course, the cautious can still hold their bitcoins buried in their garden. And as I argue below, there are many reasons to be cautious.WHAT I WANT FROM A BITCOIN BANKIf I want to store a large sum in a Bitcoin bank, then o<rest of post truncated>

Also an independent thought: I assert that the most secure way to hold Bitcoins is in an offline wallet.And as many of us know, offline wallets can RECEIVE bitcoins even when not on the network.If I ran a Bitcoin bank, I would be touting how every time you sent my bank bitcoins, that you were sending them to an OFFLINE WALLET that no hacker can get to. I would do so to serve a reminder that when you want to withdraw, that it might take me some time to put some coins back online to send you.

### Reply 1:
How is Casey wrong? Bitcoin isn't backed by anything. It's a commodity at best and a hobby at least.

### Reply 2:
Damn man, lay off the rabies... 10 posts just means (s)he hasn't posted much.They define money pretty well in the article, and I think they're pretty spot on. Bitcoin is lacking. However, what they don't get is that is has some advantages that other commodities don't have. Bitcoin's real attractions are decentralization, anonymity and inflation limitations. Casey doesn't understand that it's decentralized and doesn't understand how very anonymous bitcoin can be. He must have forgotten that GoldMoney offers not anonymity but confidentiality. Anyway, he's on the right track. He's a rather busy man, and kudos to him for not trashing it simply because it's not his favorite money, gold.

Topic: Which is the vision for the future according to regional director of Binance?
### Original post:
One of the keys to the current situation and something that differentiates it from 2017 is that the global scenario is very different: ""In these years we have seen a fairly strong adoption of crypto in countries like Venezuela or Argentina, where the inflationary situation, or mega-inflation, make people pull digital currency to maintain the value of their savings.""The pandemic, of course, has also taken its toll. When it was confined to most of the world's countries, stock markets began to fall sharply and investors, in search of liquidity, began to sell their positions. Bitcoin plunged sharply, dropping to around USD 3,000, and shortly after that, in May, there was another halving. However, after that the value started to take off again.""The global economic situation has led many people to bet on trading to earn a living in a market where employment is scarce and the health crisis is hitting hard,"" says Luis Vaello, Binance's regional director in Spain. Looking to the future, and emphasizing that they do not have a crystal ball to know what will happen, Vaello believes that we will continue to see a bullish scenario ""not in the price, but in the increasing use"". As for the price,<rest of post truncated>

The rise could be slower but i can see a clear rising tendency. This make the possibility of multiplicate the inversion x 100 or 1k really difficult, but if you invest in btc you will see profits in the future.

Everything mentioned above might be already priced-in. Market always measures (evaluate) the future, not the present. So people were betting (buying) based on this scenario in 2018-2020. Now the question is - what will be the economical situation in 2023-2025 - thats what we are doing right now on the market. Buying/selling based on our prediction on economic condition of 2023-2025. Will it be better? Will the US raise interest rates or maybe it will continue to print. Will $$ remain as global reserve currency or will crash?

### Original post:
History has always repeated itself in Bitcoin on the 24th of September 2017 when the china central bank ban <truncated> a move that sees the price of Bitcoin crashing deep before it recovered after 3 months of struggle to hold its resistance. On the 24th of September 2021 news still, fly around about china banning crypto, which turned out to be rumors and false development that see the Bitcoin price dropping to $40,675 before it gradually rises back to 41k.

### Reply 1:
Well, at least it's not that worst unlike in the past where Bitcoin didn't have much time to recover and it goes straight to bearish season after that news of China banning crypto currency. What do we expect with them to do when they don't fully support Bitcoin then that's the only way they could get rid of it. Despite of what they keep telling where there are fraudulent activities well we don't know what's the truth so let them ban crypto on their country miners will have a choice to relocate their equipment or sell them to others but I have a doubt they would do that.

### Reply 2:
The problem with this is that the ban is taken seriously by a lot of people and they don't know what's happening right now and they still think that it's a bad omen that China is making some move in the Chinese market.

Topic: 'Bitcoin' hacked -
### Original post:
Well, sort of. Bitcoin Gold was 51% attacked - apparently successfully. This is very important. While not exactly Bitcoin, it is a kind of Bitcoin. And it was hacked. We can no longer argue Bitcoin is unhackable. 51% attacks are real and possible. $18 million stolen. It can be done. The US government could probably put into place enough hashpower very quickly. The new 7nm process could be bought by someone and get a shitload of competitve hashing up and running. It is possible. My conclusion: Bitcoin can be hacked.

### Reply 1:
We all know that bitcoin can also be a target of such an attack--it's not even far-fetched as of this moment if all big miners collaborated and replicate what happened to Bitcoin Gold. However, due to Bitcoin Gold being a relatively smaller coin compared to its giant brother. such attacks are easy to perpetrate knowing that there isn't much hashing power directed in mining the coin. Also, why would the miners do such knowing that the mines they'll coin might lose value tragically overnight once people found out about the double-spends?

### Reply 2:
Nothing surprising. No one said that Bitcoin can't suffer a 51% attack. In fact, its just outright listed as one of the possible attacks that Bitcoin can suffer. It doesn't constitutes to a hack, by definition. It doesn't involve someone else gaining access to any unauthorised system. The criteria for someone to execute a 51% attack is to obviously have at least 51% of the hashrate. With Bitcoin Gold, their hashrate is still relatively small. Just because some other coin has a similar name to Bitcoin, it doesn't mean that it is Bitcoin. 51% attacks are still far too expensive to execute for Bitcoin as compared to altcoin. This post is just spreading FUD.

Topic: What things do you study while choosing a wallet?
### Original post:
There are a lot of cryptocurrency wallets to pay and receive payments. While you choose a wallet, what things do you consider first like technical support, transaction fees or blockchain technology and why and what is the most important thing for you? We should discuss that!

### Reply 1:
First is the custodianship, it is of paramount importance to wallet which is self custodian. Secondly is security and this is mostly achieved by using a cold wallet but there I also own hot wallet to store some funds for easy access. The cold wallet are where the huge funds are saved in. Thirdly is choosing an open source wallet, there are self custodian wallets that are closed source and it is entirely frowned upon. The transaction fees are also important but not just like the others listed above. The transaction fee problem is solved by using a wallet that supports the RBF opt-in. With this I could navigate around the amount of transactions fees to use.

### Reply 2:
The most important thing before choosing a wallet is the security of the wallet. Because if the wallet is not secured then our money will never be safe there. We should avoid using wallets that have weak security systems. That is, we should always avoid wallets that can be easily accessed by others. Because when our wallet security is completed then our resources will be safe in that wallet. No matter which wallet you use, we must pay a transaction fee when making a token transaction in every wallet. The transaction fee from one wallet to another is not very high. We never use wallets with less security due to small transaction fee variations. We should always use a strong and high security wallet even if the transaction fees are a bit high.

Topic: A short tale of a world currency, and fees going UP and UP and UP
### Original post:
In a far, distant future, bitcoins are not only expensive, but also very expensive to transact. Over time, as the system evolved, things got tricky in the mining sector. Miners who tried to offer cheaper rates kept having their blocks 'orphaned' until they learned to comply with the club rules: do not swamp the blockchain with cheap transactions. No matter how these heroic, rebel miners tried to get around the problem, it just wasn't working. Cheap transactions -- big blocks. Expensive transactions -- small blocks. The group consensus was: small blocks are less costly in the data centres. Meanwhile, various helpful investors saw some opportunities to tidy Bitcoin up a bit. Bitcoin, the clunky ""digital gold"" that it was, was just too bulky for the fast rough-and-ready infrastructure people wanted. So a whole new banking sector arose from the ashes of the old one. This new sector was of course very convenient and useful: each layer provided an extremely valuable service, such as lending out Bitcoin-backed credit, all for a tiny fee that was passed onto the customers. In turn, these customers also provided some extremely valuable services: accounts, ATMs, chip cards, and pleasant bran<rest of post truncated>

Isn't that basically the current system where countries (or economic regions) can independently inflate their national currencies without any transparency? Sure, debasement is visible after the fact, but the international trade -- which causes relative exchange rates to drift -- has already occurred. That could get messy with everyone trying to game the business cycles in a kind of Mexican stand-off*.*edit: or is it a normal stand-off because of a ""first mover"" advantage?

It also includes token issuance financing, crypto derivatives transactions, and other activities suspected of illegal sale of tokens.""Those who carry out related illegal financial activities that constitute a crime shall be investigated for criminal responsibility in accordance with the law,""China's market regulators and the Ministry of Public Security said cryptocurrency is ""disrupting the economic and financial order, breeding illegal and criminal activities such as gambling, illegal fund-raising, fraud, pyramid schemes, and money laundering, and seriously endangering the safety of people's property.""How will this impact Bitcoin and other cryptoprojects?? What do you think guys?

Of course it is, that is what socialism is all about: The State is supreme. Bitcoin circumvents the State, so this is the natural reaction. The central bank is the natural enemy of Bitcoin, because Bitcoin makes banks and central banks obsolete. However it is a technology, so its like banning electricity because it may end the job of the gas lamp industry.In this case it is very clear: Bitcoin removes the State and Banks power over money. Let it be, the wealth they reject will flow elsewhere, in the end they cannot stop it, no matter what.

Op, it would be nice to link the source material, so that people don't have to rely on your words or go google the news themselves. From a BBC article, the information sounds serious, but the only thing that gives hope is that it's the central bank's statement. I don't know how it works in China, but normally it's the Parliament that decides what's legal and what isn't, and a bank can make guidelines which are not legally binding and express opinions which don't necessarily align with the state's authorities' official position. Since China isn't a democracy, the central bank there probably holds more power than it normally does, but I still have doubts whether this bank's claim that cryptos are illegal actually means that they are illegal.

### Original post:
A funny cartoon picture from an Irish newspaper I spotted today: <link> there is an Irish tradition where at 12 or so your relatives give you some money, etc. In this cartoon the poor dad is scoulded for using cash when the son wants it in Bitcoin

### Reply 1:
That's what I figured

### Reply 2:
I'm not sure if I should be happy and laugh or feel sad about it. It feels funny because just as you said, their generation is probably going to be a generation of bitcoin users. By that, I mean many of them are going to be using bitcoins. It kinda feels sad because that's what the father can give and probably not be appreciated because 'it is not in bitcoin'.Good publicity for bitcoins though!

Topic: Milestones
### Original post:
Anyone care to contribute to a list of major events, milestones and challenges that bitcoin faces as the public and governments become more aware, as more users start to use bitcoins, as the value continues to increase, and so on?Such as the day bitcoin reaches a value of $10, $25, 50, $100 USD, and possibly $1000 USD.The day the first government officially reacts and takes some kind of action.The day a major media outlet officially shows recognition.I was thinking of just keeping up with any milestone events here that I think of, and trying to come up with names for them If anyone cares about this at all, I'll add them to the original post.

### Reply 1:
I don't know if you'd consider this a milestone, but a reporter from The Daily (the ipad news app owned by News Corp) just interviewed me yesterday for a story they're doing on Bitcoin. Maybe Ruport Murdoch will read it and try to buy every bitcoin. Thanks to Gavin for helping me with some Bitcoin ""talking points"".

If there was an easy way to do long bets using BTC, I'd wager that PayPal will support BTC before 2020.

### Reply 1:
That would be a problem for some people, I don't think that not everyone will be agreeing to the the prize pool in the form of cryptocurrency. Endorsement from athletes is a good thing too, if you ask me, they are sometimes bigger than the league itself, imagine getting Ronaldo, Messi, Ibrahimovic, Iniesta, Rooney, and Van Persie getting a deal and them having to promote bitcoin, the biggest achievement would be to wear a bitcoin logo in their jersey during a game.

### Reply 2:
Oh trust me bitcoin is quite big with sports. A lot of people(including me) has used bitcoin to gamble with sports/esports since like 2016 or earlier. Bitcoin is actually the best currency to use for gambling in general due to banks and typical payment processors like PayPal mostly having a negative stance towards it.

Topic: Best way to protect wallet?
### Original post:
Hi I had a general question about wallets.What is the best way to protect your bitcoin from being hacked? Would creating a wallet and storing it offline on a usb drive be the safest bet?thanks

### Reply 1:
ok this is what I was wondering, whats the easiest way to make an offline wallet? I just read a how to using bitcoin qt to make it. Are there easier ways?

### Reply 2:
The answer to that depends on a number of factors. Obviously, a person wanting to protect 10 or 50 BTC in an offline wallet has different requirements than a business protecting thousands.Armory is so useful because it not only lets you prepare and use the wallet from an offlien machine, but it lets you create a spend transaction that you transport over to a connected machine and that is safe to spend.Another method is to use a paper wallet from an offline computer using the .html from BitAddress:- <link> problem with that is when you want to spend you are generally importing the private key into a machine that is connected to the network, in order to spend the funds. So that is a method that is somewhat less secure than the Armory method. So maybe one solution is to create many smaller wallets se.g., 2 or 4 BTC each, so that the risk when redeeming is limited to just the one paper wallet being redeemed.

### Reply 1:
That's why they teamed up with 3M, to develop thermal conductive compounds.What if they used a different medium, do you remember the solder iron sold on TV infomercials, battery operated, instant heat, melts solder?The tip was made out of a novel type of silicon that multiplies temperature. If you put that between the layers of the chips and apply cold temps, which would be multiplied by 10, you could get an effective thermoregulator.

### Reply 2:
To calculate your thermal dynamic opinion, we would need to define the boundry of the closed system, have an advanced scientific calculator, and possess electron microscope data about the molecular structure and it's effects in stratum. (I don't think your clamp meter will be useful.)Aluminium is an energy multiplier, they don't use it in spaceships because of this.

Topic: Peter Zeihan’s misleading information about bitcoin
### Original post:
The person you think is having knowledge can mislead you, you need to know the right thing yourself, see what an analyst said about bitcoin in a podcast or something:<link> I see is that Peter Zeihan do not know what bitcoin is, he is only of the old fashion where the world has passed and moving to the future.He said bitcoin has no value. The price of bitcoin today is $17000 and he said the price will go down $17000 more. That only means that the price of bitcoin is going to zero. But if that happens, he needs to wake up and see that he is only dreaming and not in reality. He said bitcoin has no value, he did not know how bitcoin has helped economy, making poor people to become rich. Because of bitcoin, blockchain was created, helping the world. Countries are now making use of blockchain today. If not for bitcoin, there may be nothing like crypto exchanges today, see the tax the government are generating, also from other crypto businesses. See what people are generating from mining.This so called analysts that has nothing good to offer about bitcoin just said bitcoin has no intrinsic value. If you do not know about something, why lying to the world?

### Reply 1:
Whenever something becomes popular and is considered the ""hot topic"" a lot of people would try to talk about it so that they can be seen. Sometimes it backfires when they say a bunch of nonsense that shows how little knowledge they have and how illiterate they are.I don't really know who this guy is and after looking him up, he is claiming to be a ""geopolitical strategist"" and after looking into that it seems like he doesn't even have any actual knowledge in that field lol.

### Reply 2:
There have been many 'Peter Zeihan's' ever since BTC's creation, it was supposed to be a bubble for them, that didn't happen, then it was supposed to collapse once there was a world crisis or something similar to that, we had covid pandemic and currently there is global inflation, but BTC didn't collapse. Now that they know it can't collapse they want to regulate it and also spread their cbdc's to see if people would be more interested in it than BTC. I have stopped listening to people who think BTC has no value, it proves the person as one who speaks without research or understanding.

Topic: Bitcoin in ""silent mode
### Original post:
I was talking about bitcoin on some forum and at some point I was explaining that all transactions are public. I gave bitcoinexplorer.com as an example of a website where people could have details about any transaction.At this point there was a misunderstanding, for one of the guys I was talking to thought bitcoinexplorer.com was part of the system, that during a transaction, both parties had to refer to this website in order to perform the transaction. Of course, I had to explain that this is not the way bitcoin works, that bitcoin doesn't need any website to function properly.However, this made me think of something.Right now there are a few websites that are very useful to the bitcoin project. bitcoin.org and its forum of course, <truncated> bitcoinwatch.com and others.Would the use of bitcoin be really the same without those websites ? Isn't bitcoinwatch.com quite reassuring for instance, since it allows a user to check that ""everything is right"" by comparing his block number to bitcoinwatch's block number ?So, if governments decided to shut down all bitcoin related websites and forums, then bitcoin would need to work in ""silent mode"". People would have to trust their client on<rest of post truncated>

Topic: freecashsoftware com scam
### Original post:
Hi,freecashsoftware com actually got me to visit their site. I thought I can investigate their facebook page to carefully analyze what's going on but the click-video-reflex was stronger than my caution. I instantly closed the tab before anything visual loaded but I'm still scared. Any of the uber-geeks mind investigating? I wgot the index.html and it clearly has some obfuscated shit in it so I reported it to facebook but maybe somebody else feels more inclined to hurt this scammer before we read stolen wallet reports.

### Reply 1:
I knew it is a scam but I was curious to know if it is a stealer or just a scam that asks me politely to give them my money. I just visited the page (btcrobot com is where it forwards me to) in a virtual machine and with this lengthy video and design and stuff it feels much more like a regular scam but I'm still scared. VM restored snapshot and yeah, I'm scared something creeped out of the vm thanx to full desktop integration.

### Reply 2:
from what i can see the <truncated> site is just a video intro.. no hidden downloads of viruses etc. and from the video it appears to be a give me your bitcoin and ill trade it on the micro ramps/dumps (day trading)this doesnt prove if it is a scam or not.. but if you have ever come across pirate@40's sales pitch, you would easily start smelling something fishy here too.remember bitcoin is YOUR money, in YOUR possession. so don't give it to people with the pretence that they can give you profit back. because that is what banks have been telling 'savers' for many decades.and if you decide to risk it. atleast know exactly who you are dealing with, so that you can slap then with a wet fish or a court order if it all goes wrong.

Topic: Lamassu in my local bagel shop
### Original post:
I was impressed when I ran across a Lamassu ATM in my local bagel shop (suburb of Boston), sitting next to a regular USD cash ATM -- made me think that Bitcoin had really hit mainstream.I didn't have time to stop and try using the machine, was wondering if anybody else has used these machines, and if they are considered safe to use, esp when selling?

### Reply 1:
I don't know about that ATM but coinradar shows 3 Lamassu ATMs in Boston and they all share one thing that ensures I wouldn't use them even if all exchanges are down.This is no longer a business practice, it's showing your possible customers the middle finger.LE:I missed the suburb part<link> fees...

### Reply 2:
Ehh at this point I pretty much think bitcoin ATMs are almost irrelevant. I mean yea, any publicity is good publicity, but if someone were to use one of those ATMs to buy bitcoin solely due to curiosity and later learned how the ATMs are ripping them off with humongous price increases, then it would definitely leave a bad taste in their mouth.

Topic: Bitcoin and PayPal together?
### Original post:
So I recently heard that the guy who started up Xapo was appointed to the board of directors at PayPal, which I think is a very interesting move, since they are competitors. The thing is, I'm confused as to their motives. I figured that they could perhaps be wanting to bring someone on to help integrate bitcoin into their system (which I think is unlikely) or they want to bring someone in who would help them ""beat"" bitcoin. What's your take on this?

### Reply 1:
Stay positive, I think maybe they just want to make Bitcoin better. And however, no one will take Bitcoin down.

### Reply 2:
Competition between digital currency will indeed occur strictly see now that we are in the modern era.If bitcoin is not holding the renewal and improvement of the performance of bitcoin will definitely be left far behind.But I think today bitcoin still hold good renewal and improvement

Topic: Free Talk Live Interviews Roger Ver aka Bitcoin Jesus
### Original post:
On their Thursday night show recently. FTL is the largest pro-liberty talk show here in the US w/ over 150 radio affiliates. They are also huge promoters of the Free State Project. Here's the 20 min interview - <link>

### Reply 1:
never heard of that but thanks for sharing this

### Reply 2:
One of the main cohosts has been on vacation for a couple weeks so everything will return to normal when he returns. FTL offers a panel discussion of liberty in an iconoclastic way and it's always interesting when conservatives or liberals call in on a topic in agreement and then things shift and they're blown away by the defense of liberty in something they disagree with, makes for great radio esp on saturdays when they have their most affiliates on live. Plus, it's easy to get on the show as there's next to no screening process and they take calls from all over the world, in english of course. Also, they rarely have guests on so it's basically a show about your calls, hence Free Talk Live.

Sometimes negative things just are what they are... negative things. We need to acknowledge that more in my opinion.

a kind of activity to manipulate prices in the market. when the price will be pumped, they investors will make large purchases so that the activity of coins that will be in the pump will increase, so they really can benefit from the pump. that's how i know about pump.

Topic: hypothesis on why I think the real Sotoshi was found
### Original post:
I think the man they found could really be the creator of bitcoins. It is possible that he created the project as just a hobby and never expected it to become what it has; he saw no reason to hide his identity. His age and the nature of his hobbies also contribute to the connection of him to the bitcoin project. Monetarily speaking, he may have only expected to make enough to retire comfortably. Many of the world's greatest inventions are accidents and so could be his bitcoin project.edited in: Maybe Satoshi wanted the world to acknowledge his genius. Maybe he wanted to be found out someday.

### Reply 1:
For one, why would Satoshi wish to remain anonymous but blatantly use his real name online? It's possible Satoshi is not his real name or he changed his name legally to Satoshi Nakamoto.

### Reply 2:
I think that he could have created the bitcoin project for ""fun"" and therefore had no reason to hide his identity; he did not predict the meteoric rise of bitcoins value. Or... maybe it's just a bored, old Japanese guy trying to created some drama for himself by taking false credit (or ""not"" taking credit in a slick manner).

First:This is not about coins you might have stored in 3rd party wallets or exchanges like Mt Gox or Quadriga. This is about coins you really own, not about promises you will have some if it's gonna be sunny tomorrow.So lately I really got bored and growing a bit frustrated of all those articles with 10-20% of some 3rd world country population holding crypto, and one thing was like the last straw and made me start this topic, which some of you will really not like, I know it. And the culprit was this :What can I say...lol?16% of 57, let's say 45 million adults is 7 million. Let's just note this down. 7!But there is Turkey, ..20% out of 60 million adults, another 12.And we have also Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia with a 16% average that would be 250 million adults so 40 million more.5 countries and we have reached 60 million so-called crypto users and ownersIf we cut altcoin since the article clams bitcoin is the most popular we have 40 million at least.So no EU, no US, no China-Japan-South Korea.Just by adding China and India we would go close to 150 million.On the other part, I don't have polls and interviews.I have something far more reliable than this, something in which we all<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Unfortunately, Bitcoin currently can't handle that: With 328,284 transactions per day, 20 million people could each make only 6 transactions per year. A large increase in user numbers is only possible if an off-chain solution, side-chain or custodial wallet reaches mass-adoption.

### Reply 2:
What makes things worse is that even if you purchase something it doesn't mean a single transaction is done.I always check for fun how my coins travel while I wait for the order to complete and sometimes I see them making like 3-4 hops before reaching what I guess is an exchange. So the actual capacity of the network might be a lot lower even with batching.But if usage might not be possible on-chain, storing your coins should be.11-2017 Addresses richer than 1 USD ...14,813,458*with btc at 7000$.Now: Addresses richer than 1 USD....20,330,265I would call this at least disappointing...

Topic: Tim Draper will give you money to learn about Bitcoin
### Original post:
They are giving away Bitcoin to all who attend and educate about Bitcoin...There is always a catch.Here it is:The general admission tickets cost $299, Bitcoin giveaway is $100 but...tickets are free if you sign up through eToro - which is the title sponsor of the event.Source

### Reply 1:
So if that was really the case, it's pretty much no payment admission, but instead you pay with your KYC/AML information. Somewhat like Coinbase Earn[1]. The $299 ticket is just there to pretty much make the ""free ticket"" through eToro look like a great deal.[1] <link>

### Reply 2:
I seem to remember eToro always ""gave"" some amount of money to ""play"" when you brought your own. You could never withdraw that as it was meant for ""playing"" only. Yeah i know it sounds like a Casino for some reason, but the ""game"" is like ""trading"" with forex, stocks, other assets like metals, oil, and even some crypto. It has a term ""cfd"" or whatever.Its a promotion to get you hooked to their site. Are you sure those ""$100"" aren't really for ""playing"" inside eToro? You can probably NOT withdraw that...

Topic: Selfish mining theory
### Original post:
If someone controls a couple nodes (10 for example, shouldn't be hard to do that right?), and at some point he isolates those nodes from the other bitcoin nodes, that will lead to an isolated blockchain that only he have access to it, and if he mines on it at 1kh/s or whatever super slow hash rate, at the time of recalculating the difficulty, it'll drop down by huge amount considering there wouldn't be any new blocks found between the time he isolated the chain till the time of changing the target difficulty (maybe he waits for 2 recalculating events, or modify something to make the difficulty drop to lowest possible not sure how possible that is). After this new low difficulty, he uses high mining power to create blocks at very high speed since the difficulty has dropped (on his own blockchain), meanwhile the true blockchain will have generated blocks that aren't included in those isolated chains, but due to him having low difficulty he generated twice the amount of blocks (or maybe x1.5 for example) if he then releases those nodes and they start interacting with other nodes, will this ""self generated"" chain become the ""true"" chain? I mean since it's a longer chain wouldn't it be <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
I think what OP means is to separate from the network, and mine with a really low hashrate. Then, because of the lack of blocks found, the difficulty in OP's network would drop by a lot, and he/she would use a large amount of hashing power to catch up and overtake the main network's blocks.

### Reply 2:
It would take too long to find enough blocks until the difficulty recalculates. The difficulty does not readjust every two weeks, it readjusts every 2016 blocks. It would take a very long time to find enough blocks to finish the remaining 2016 blocks until the difficulty recalculates with only a few kh/s of mining power and once the difficulty does adjust with your ""special"" blockchian the ""real"" blockchain will be much longer then what your new blockchain would be able to achieve.

Topic: 51% attack on Bitcoin
### Original post:
Hey guys,As we know, as long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, Bitcoin network remains safe.I was wondering what it would cost to control 51% of the mining hash rate? Is this ever a realistic threat?Appreciate your answers in advance!Kind regards,Papa

### Reply 1:
51% attack is very much impossible because youll need to have a lot in place before itll take place. Ive read about 51% attack before and its said that it can not be possible because of how the system works, theyll easily detect it and prevent it before the attacker succeeds. Owning more than 50% of the mining power is very very impossible. Why waste your efforts and energy on something that is not beneficial?

### Reply 2:
It's a very expensive attempt. Hundred millions of resources could be the budget of it. Who will attempt to do like that if it can be reiterate later by the community devs. It's just a ""way"" of that a blockchain can be changed/hacked etc. but there's no way it can be done to bitcoin blockchain as it's on it's peak of hashrate.

Hi all!I'm new to this forum, so sorry if haven't found required subject. I'm wondering your opinion about cloud mining platforms - does they all scam or there is an ability to mine some using their service.Thanks for your advices!

### Reply 1:
Thanks for answer. Bad to hear.. Don't have an ability to invest money to hardware now. Maybe there is some list or something in forum, where I can find mining platform from last 1%? And would be appritiate for the bitcoin price, which make cloud mining process profitable.

### Reply 2:
Re-read my previous reply on this thread. You're not going to make money off cloud mining. If you could, then people would've went all in on these services.Tell you what. On one of the cloud mining sites I've visited in the past, the cheapest cloud mining variant is like $30. Guess what. I tried it just for shits and giggles. A year later, not a single payout because I didn't even earn enough for the transaction fee to be worth it.

Topic: Crypto Influencers that have been inadvertently affected by Youtube blanket ban
### Original post:
<link> if you're following your favourite youtube crypto influencers, don't be surprise because Youtube is currently purging their system. Here are some on the list that have been negatively affected.

### Reply 1:
That's a temporary effect! Youtube is probably going out of the crypto game and hence started removing crypto related videos and channels. However, in today's world Youtube is probably the most famous platform but certainly not the only video platform. All these channels will eventually be available in Dailymotion very soon! There arr other options available like Vimeo, Twitch, metacafe etc. One lost opportunity to Youtube, may provide big growth to these alternatives video streaming platforms!

Topic: Opera now lets US users buy crypto with Apple Pay or debit card
### Original post:
<link> need some positive news like this, I'm not a US citizen, however, I think this is another step to purchase BTC much easier using Apple Pay. They are going to partner with Wyre - US <truncated> firm, to enable crypto-purchases directly from their browser. They say that it is very easy and you can top up your crypto wallet in 30 seconds, but I don't know if that is true or not though.

### Reply 1:
Is the built-in wallet open source? If not then avoid using it. Remember what Andreas Antonopoulos always says: ""not your keys, not your bitcoins"".Tbh, avoid using Opera, some shady stuff going on with that company lately: <link> really, not many people use Opera browser. You can google ""browser market share"" and you'll see how terrible Opera's numbers are compared to other browsers.

### Reply 2:
I tried looking it up but there's no ""open-source"" reference to it anywhere on DuckDuckGo. I doubt it's open-source too. It looks like they do not have KYC though for now, which is good news. Here's the quote from cryptoiq.co:If there was a KYC-free open source wallet that allows debit card purchases, it would be amazing. I'm just kinda afraid to use debit cards now, considering the fact that we're in the middle of an economical recession.

### Reply 2:
Yes there is no doubt bitcoin will breal $100.000 but it cannot happen in 1 month. Of course we will see corrections and fluctuations. In the beginning of 2017 bitcoin price was under $1000 and now we see it is 10 times more. So in the beginning of 2018 it is around $10.000 and we can see $100.000 at the end of year. So it is a reasonable prediction.

A Florida teen just got arrested for Twitters huge hackEarly this morning, the FBI, IRS, US Secret Service, and Florida law enforcement placed a 17-year-old in Tampa, Florida, under arrest accusing him of being the mastermind behind the biggest security and privacy breach in Twitters history, one that took over the accounts of President Barack Obama, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and more to perpetrate a huge bitcoin scam on July 15th.The teen is currently in jail, being charged with over 30 felony count, including organized fraud, communications fraud, identity theft, and hacking, according to Hillsborough State Attorney Andrew Warren in a just-broadcast news conference describing the arrest.Its not clear whether the 17-year-old is the only suspect in the case. I cant comment on whether he worked alone, said Warren. He was arrested at his apartment where he lives by himself, authorities stated.UPDATE: 3:30 PM EST According to the U.S. Department of Justice, two other individuals 19-year-old U.K. resident Mason Sheppard and 22-year-old Florida resident Nima Fazeli have also been charged for their alleged participation in the hacks.Sheppard has <rest of post truncated>

""Not an ordinary kid"" ... I wonder what kind of kid there is, whether he worked alone, and how they found him out.

Otherwise, America will have problems as a super villain. By the way, he can ask to mitigate his sentence, because he just asked people for bitcoins, and did not arrange a global terror. Also, he didn't force anyone to send bitcoins to who knows where.

The moment those coins moved, I know that someone is going to be pinned. Earlier, I said on a comment that one exchange should have relayed the information to the authorities to get someone arrested on the hack, well I guess they proved me wrong and here we are. Also, since the dude hacked inside an ex-POTUS and other big names' accounts that could possibly contain sensitive information, they wouldn't get him off lightly that's for sure. Then again, we could see some form of 'reformation' for the dude in the end, and be employed even for the government! I wonder whether Justin Sun would really be good on his words, and to whom would he give the bounty anyways?

And for what? No, China is a closed chapter, and that it, from the start it was obvious that bitcoin is not something that is welcomed there, the fact that it took them so many steps to actually come to an all-out ban is the surprising part, not the final outcome. Do we need them? No! Can bitcoin survive without China? Of course, it does it right now and it's doing great!What we definite<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
The obsession with China is something that will not disappear so soon, because a lot of people still think that China is in some way necessary for Bitcoin to succeed - of course because it is the most populous country in the world and because they are already (or will become) the first world economy. What they all completely ignore is their political system, and only those who have not experienced the evil of communism still have some hope that China will accept Bitcoin in one way or another.The best thing that happened was that Bitcoin was banned in that country, because China has actually been one massive weight around Bitcoin all this time - we can finally move forward without listening to what comes next from that country.On the contrary, if more people used this option, there would be less spam - and the goal is to discourage those who are shitposters. The OP always has the option to bump his thread every 24 hours if he wants to make it visible.Report posts based on inaccurate information only make sense if we substantiate our claims with information that unequivocally proves it. Mods will not waste their time determining whether some information is accurate or not.

### Reply 2:
I know how Chinese crypto enthusiasts felt about the government laying down the axe on Bitcoin mining and other crypto-related stuff. Really sucks to live there if I'm heavily relying on crypto for a living (whether working with a company, a trader, etc.). When I saw that news on Facebook, I am not convinced nor believing that they would really do a U-Turn and unban Bitcoin mining (unless it's really coming from them or from their own mouth).

Topic: New Ethical Community focused Bitcoin Trading Site
### Original post:
Hi guys, I am in the process of launching a new Bitcoin Trading Site and would like to get the communities feedback as to what they would hope for in an ideal trading platform. I'm hoping this can be run on a not for profit basis- its goal purely to support the idea that is Bitcoin and crypto currency.As such I'm hoping that there can I can support trading with the tiniest amount of fees (think 1p per trade). This would all go to server/website maintenance.Whilst there are a few trading platforms available I feel they are purely private enterprises which seek to profit not support Bitcoin. Im hoping I can create a site which is the very antithesis of Mt Gox.Aside from low fees and the equally popular and safe escrow transferral method what top 5 items would you like to see in a new trading site?Forums, live chat etc..Your feedback is much appreciated.

Topic: Bitcoin plus - is it owned by a member of this forum? - RANT ALERT!
### Original post:
If you dont know about bitcoin plus its a javascript cpu mining ""pool"", which obviously pays out small small amounts of BTC. So ive had it running at the office for a few weeks and amassed a fortune of 0.02 btc. Not much, but hey, i like free bitcoins.Anyhow here comes my rant:IMHO this is a complete scam, as the owner claims that he needs to discount 0.01 btc for transaction fees. This is absolutely ridiculous given that it takes a solid week to generate 0.01 btc with his software. So basically he just rips everyone off and prolly keeps most if not all bitcoins to himself. Might seem like small amounts, but added up its probably a NICE bounty.Id like to give the owner a chance to defend his policies and site, so bitcoin plus dude if youre a member of the community, speak up!

### Reply 1:
Just do some simple math and compare. a quad core gives about 14 mhs or so and will destroy it quickly at that rate. So that is 1/20th of a Hd5830 which will atm produce .24btc a day. By use of a simple ratio, thats about 0.012 a day. But wait. Your not using a 5830 and this dosent work in ratio at all. So in reality, due to your small shares, your are probably getting half that at 0.006btc a day. Also, im willing to bet your not using a quadcore cpu because most offices dont have one. And if you are using it, the computer would be unusable at that speed, so lets just say at the best case scenario that you are mining for 16 hours a day. You would be getting now 0.004btc a day. If you are only using half the cores, you would be getting 0.003btc a day if your mining nonstop. So by my calculations, you are using a mid range intel, probably a P4HT or a Core2Duo. Sound right? If so, then your ""mass fortune"" is all you earned. Get a gpu

Topic: Do you keep your coins physically secure?
### Original post:
We're all aware of the risks of keeping our coins on online wallets and exchange wallets, but many of us still keep our coins on our own devices.Are we keeping our devices secure? Its instinctual to not leave your fiat money wallet unattended in a public place but what about your bitcoin wallet? Are you leaving leaving the laptop you're writing your novel on the table at Starbucks when you go the bathroom? The laptop with your electrum wallet, your life savings.Where does the line between paranoia and reasonable physical security meet?

### Reply 1:
I have considered these factors before. If you are using the device that contains your wallet / storage, don't ever put your private keys/seeds there.My remedy on this one is back up and 2FA (if needed) but back up for me is enough. And also be responsible wherever you go, it's your money that you are securing if you go in public places not others.

### Reply 2:
I don't have coins yet but I'm planning to keep half to a hard wallet and half of it in exchanges for safe keeping. In case market value goes up or down.

Topic: Short-Term Trades are toxic for the present downchart?
### Original post:
Due to alot of orders ( buying and selling ) many short time traders are buying right now for cheap bitcoins and selling them right away for some more bucks, which generated alot of nonesense volume.Sometimes even under the present chart price which forces the other traders to bit their orders on a better sell price so the price of bitcoin is going deeper and deeper even fasterwhas your opinion?

Topic: Crypto Sportz - a platform for peer to peer wagers on sporting events
### Original post:
Hey all! Looking for some feedback on a passion project that I'm looking to launch February 1st for the Superbowl. The BETA version will be the first full-functioning, blockchain-powered platform for sports wagers. My colleagues and I believe it to be a solution to the headaches of the traditional betting experience: no bookies, wallets, spreads, etc.Our peer-to-peer platform is designed around Ethereums Smart Contracts--an autonomous set of code that executes wagers securely. With some Ether in your wallet, you can select your game, team, and outcome predictions. All transfers and winnings never leave the Ethereum network and are updated in your wallet when the game results are validated. The more participants, the bigger the prize pool!Were a group of sports and crypto fans hailing from different backgrounds like tech and marketing. We created Crypto Sportz to introduce an easier and more secure way of making bets with friends over sports games.We would love to answer any of your questions. If youre interested, or would like to join the BETA check us out at <truncated>

Topic: Banking System a Scam...!!!
### Original post:
Godfrey Bloom, have anyone heard of him. It is the first time I'm hearing such a personality. He's a former member of the European Parliament. The statement of him made me know better about him.""The entire banking system is a scam and the state an institution of theft"".The statements were true, and this person has bought his first bitcoin in his 70th age. And from the books written by him, it is clear that he's an economist too. Without knowing about the market and the goodness surely these people won't get into the cryptocurrency. Also he has clearly mentioned that I haven't changed my mind towards bitcoin, as he has accumulated large volume of gold and now as a form of diversification of investments I've done it.Source : news.bitcoin.com

### Reply 1:
Banking system is a scam: Yes.Bitcoin Cash is a scam project: Yes.Bitcoin.com is a website of scam project: Yes.The website's layout is for Bitcoin Cash (BCH), not for Bitcoin. The owner of the site should register a website with a domain Bitcoincash.com to shill their project. They try to scam people with the domain name bitcoin.com.The main color of bitcoin logo is orange, not green. What a shame from Roger Ver.

### Reply 2:
I never heard of him until four days ago when cryptomaniac_xxx posted this <link> took him a long time to buy his first ever bitcoin hehe. From the article, he's been exposing that the banking system is a scam since 2013 <link> If he thought highly of bitcoin and bought a lot back then aside from gold, he's probably criticizing banks and traditional institutions more often than before. But, anyway, better late than never.

Topic: I lost my life savings trading Bitcoin Don't be like me.
### Original post:
I don't know why am I am posting this here but I wanted someone to talk to. Since I can't talk about this to my family or friends because I am ashamed of myself. I am lazy piece of garbage who tried to make money the easy way, and get rich quick trading. I have failed my family and myself, I deserve everything that happened and will happen to me. It's time to take accountability for my actions. I think this will be my last message to the world, I am sorry

### Reply 1:
I am sorry for your loss, if you are involved in a legit trading platform and still holding your Bitcoin, even though you bought Bitcoin at a higher price, you can still wait for the market to recover and eventually sells at a profit. But if you got baited by a scam company then there is nothing to do but to report this scam to the authority if you happen to know the person that invited or influenced you to invest in such a scam company.Failure as bad as it seems is also essential for personal growth. Overcoming this kind of event will make you stronger providing that you learned from your mistakes. Thouhg I know it is very troublesome but money can be replaced ifyou work hard to recover your loss by finding a new source of income. And while you are at it, try to learn more about Bitcoins so that you can avoid doing the same mistakes in the future.

### Reply 2:
Op Im sorry for your loss. One thing you should realize is that nothing good comes easy I get the fact that you did try to trade in other to get some quick money but it turned out not to be a success. Believe me when I say that they are so many users here in this forum that have been in the same shoe as you currently are and once had the same thought you currently have right now (which is to harm yourself) if they had done anything stupid to themself do you think they would have been able to achieve what they have managed to have now? No.Like its popular said in my locality Nah who Dey alive Dey fit make corrections Meaning Only those alive can right what they did wrong so if you decide to end your life (as you said in the end part of your post) what effect do you think that will have on your family? Or your friends. You just lost money and if you continue to develop your self Im 100% sure that youll make x10000 of what you just lost today, so take some time off the internet look for activity to engage in so that you can forget what happened because if you should stay idle youll surely have some negative thoughts so just go out there and try to forget about what happen and when the<rest of post truncated>

Topic: Is everyone that got in late last year in the red now ? How bad is it ?
### Original post:
I'm still in the green...more than double my initial investment. But then I got in nearly 2 years ago.

### Reply 1:
Maybe some are at the moment (actually I am sure many are), but as always it's best to look at where they will be in the long term. It depends one ones goals, bzt it seems to me that so far the best strategy is to buckle down and forget about crypto in times like this (as in hodl what you got).

### Reply 2:
I would guess it depends on WHEN they got in.Late July last year or about 10 months ago BTC was $30k give or take so if you got in because you thought that was the low you are more or less fine.End of January this year BTC was at $35k so if you thought 2022 was going to be a bull run then you are down a bit. But still down less then had you invested in many things in the stock market.Between those 2 times you could have lost 1/2 your investment.But you would be in about the same position if you bought TSLA at it's 52 week high and much better off then if you bought DWAC at it's 52 week high.-Dave

Topic: Why use exchanges online vallet?
### Original post:
Why people use exchanges' online valets? There have been several thefts on those. Why use them? I prefer local valet on my computer. I personally use MultibitHD.

### Reply 1:
I think most people are into online wallets because it's very easy to use, especially if you just got into bitcoin and are still learning. Desktop wallets take up a lot of space which some people don't have.

### Reply 2:
There could be several reasons to this and unfortunately many fall prey to it. Few that I could think of are:1) Ease of access of funds: Many prefer the ability to easily access their funds from an exchange website through a portable device, probably their smartphones. 2) Laziness and/or lack of understanding about security: Sometimes people prefer exchanging altcoins and monitor the prices, they prefer to keep it there for days or weeks or even months and wait for the opportune moment to trade without realizing it's risky storing them on web wallets. Most exchanges give importance on ""fees (methods to earn commission)"" and easy ""exchange"" but ignore security factors. People assume a web wallet with 2-factor authentication keeps them safe, but it need not be the case. Until and unless you alone have access to your private keys (considering it's not a multi-sig wallet), it's good to understand that the cryptocurrency you store on these exchanges may not be yours.

He compares Bitcoin against the gold industry, the banking system and the production of physical currency.

### Reply 1:
That just is a opinion of author. Bitcoin will delete all the other monetary systems, it work and develop itself. The people scare about that Bitcoin will replace current currency but I think it's impossible, I think Bitcoin will live parallel with current money system but is in the Internet

### Reply 2:
Bitcoin is not going to delete anything. For the foreseeable future both monetary systems are going to exist side-by-side until there is a gradual transition towards blockchain based currencies. This doesn't necessarily mean it will be Bitcoin specifically that wins the future of currencies, but something based on blockchain technology. In fact, the first is rarely the one that dominates the market, so it's likely that something will come along to overthrow it unless BTC forks several times to keep up with the pace of change.

Topic: BTC38 hot wallet got hacked and lost 1.5 million
### Original post:
2 hours later, another 8btc thread gave out the true reason: BTC38 was hit by a hacker with approximate loss of 1.5 million RMB.As a result of the server logic problems on 21st Dec, more than 10 million Bitshares, over 10 million NXT and some BTC/LTC were stolen from the exchanges hot wallet (estimated total loss of 1.5 million RMB). We shut down the server immediately and stayed up all night to fix the problem. We have reviewed our wallet deployment plan and made new adjustments. We will take full responsibility for the total loss of the digital asset (market buyback). The most important assurance is that all funds are safe in the hands of BTC38. BTC38 explained the delay to calm down the market:As we are currently redeploying the wallet, the service for certain coins will be resumed gradually.<link>

### Reply 1:
What concerns me is not only the amount of money have been lost but how easy site's security gap found and they fell victim of hacking. This proves that administrators, and anybody is responsible about security of these exchange sites must be anytime in alert because even though they said that they take full responsibility about digital assets loss they lost forever their customer's faith.

### Reply 2:
The conversion rate is 1 RMB = 0.145 USD, so they got away with about $217801.66 USD if my calculator is working correctly. The users will not be affected in any way, because the exchange already said that they will cover the losses. Why do we always see ""hacks"" when the Bitcoin price breaks out? People should not store large amounts of coins on these exchanges, but they are not listening and when this happens, people lose a lot of money and then they blame Bitcoin.

Topic: What do you think about Fiat and Banks? Can Bitcoin solve the problem?
### Original post:
The problem with Fractional reserve banking system.This means that banks are only required to keep a certain percentage of the deposited money in their bank vault or at the central bank. The remaining money is loaned out to other customers who need the money to finance various activities, such as buying a home, starting a business, or making a large purchase.Fractional reserve banking allows banks to make profits by charging interest on loans while ensuring that depositors have access to their money whenever they need it. So, they are under the condition to let their customers withdraw mass amount of their deposits, thus creating a crisis.This is the reason why all the Banks are broken. They are lending out money to people which they don't have or own. And the most concerning thing is counterfeiting. If a normal person does it, then it's a crime, but when the central banks and government does it, they can get away with it. This is the one thing that hurts the economy the most. When they go bankrupts, the whole pressure is put upon taxpayers. This is a criminal scandal. Bitcoin could solve all of this. Counterfeiting could be avoided at all cost with this, and bitcoin having limited<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
I don't see people getting used to not keeping their funds on centralized exchanges any time soon, because some people won't just learn until something very bad happen to them or their money. Before the FTX saga there was Luna, before Luna there was Mt-Gox if people should have learned it would have been a long time ago and centralized exchanges will struggle to survive, the only thing closer to Banks in crypto space are centralized exchanges.This is why I called CEX the bank of the digital space, and it is also why I still blame some developers, I wonder why they have not been able to come up with a decentralized exchange that is 99% close to everything that a CEX has to offer, but in a Decentralized form, this is why Bitcoin existed right? Everyone should use Bitcoin as an example, and also follow its way.

### Reply 2:
Because of fiat. It is impossible to have an instant decentralized fiat/bitcoin exchange because of how slow fiat is. CEXs get around this by taking custody of your fiat first, but the price you pay is zero privacy and zero security. The caveat to what you have said is that some exchanges, such as Coinbase, already allow instant off-chain transactions between their users. Such transactions are internal only - Coinbase update balances on their internal database, but nothing ever touches the blockchain. In such cases, Coinbase doesn't move any bitcoin and does not even need to own the bitcoin in question. Such transactions are absolutely ""thin air bitcoin"", as you put it.Only if you have bitcoin in your own wallet do you actually own any bitcoin. Otherwise all you own is an entry in a spreadsheet.

As CoinDesk previously reported, that day saw steep declines across all cryptocurrency markets, pushing prices down roughly 50% from their 2018 highs.According to Kobayashi's report, additional liquidations could be coming, pending approval from the bankruptcy court.""I plan to consult with the court and determine further sale of BTC and BCC,"" he wrote.As it stands, Kobayashi is in possession of 166,344.35827254 BTC - an amount worth $1.7 billion at press time - as well as about $197 million worth of bitcoin cash.<link>

Topic: [ASK] About Ledger and Transaction Speed ​Bitcoin
### Original post:
We know that all bitcoin transactions will be recorded in the ledger and the data will get bigger day by day, is it logical if the recording has reached 100 or 200 years, and how big will the bitcoin ledger data be in the future?In my opinion, bitcoin transactions are very slow, because they take around 10 minutes, even though currently there is LN but in my opinion it is not the right solution, especially since there are people who say LN is not bitcoin because it is different from the main bitcoin network. Can bitcoin transactions be accelerated in the future? I think Bitcoin needs to accelerate with increasingly sophisticated technological developments, and transaction speed will probably become a vital need in the future

### Reply 1:
This has actually been a concern to me even thogugh I do not see it from a technical standpoint as I am no developer but looking intrinsically, it will not be ideal to have Bitcoin continue with this degree of drag and possibly increase it over the years without an upgrade.The Bitcoin developers should work on an upgrade just like ethereum is working on upgrades to find possible means of processing transactions faster than initial design time.

### Reply 2:
Many will understand your concern of having that 10 minutes confirmation time, but that is just an average before a new block is found and developers won't just update because of this and for a reason of it's actually technically possible (i hope im wrong). But instead they could at least extend higher storage size instead of 2 1 mb for every block for more transaction getting catered in every block.

Topic: Does Bitcoin address reuse concerns apply only to spends/outputs?
### Original post:
I understand that its not good security and privacy practice to reuse addresses after a spend due to the fact that the public key becomes available for that address during the spend and it essentially weakens the security and privacy.Is an address still considered 100% secure for which has only ever seen inputs/deposits and has never seen a spend? What if that input only address is on a hardware wallet like a trezor along with other addresses with balances? If I understand this correctly, spending from a trezor could come from any one or multiple addresses which has spendable inputs in that wallet. Once any spend on such a wallet occurs, it's not advisable to reuse any of the previous addresses for deposits.

### Reply 1:
The primary issue with address reuse is privacy, though there is also a small security risk. There is no benefit to reusing addresses, so why do it?

### Reply 2:
Only problem with using an address over and over again is that people will be able to see all the transactions going through it, and basically stalk your account and it's balance, which if you don't care, you'll be fine.It does make things a lot easier, you can just copy the address in your notes and send it to anyone, and also makes looking at your balance when you don't have access to your wallet a lot easier, personally do this myself .

Topic: Missing bag in NYC has all kinds of bitcoin :(
### Original post:
I spent most of my day shooting video for bitbeing.com. Bit being skateboarding by all the big banks in the financial distract and around Wall St. I was hoping to edit it down tonight and put it up on the <truncated> my khaki bag with T2i DSLR, lenses, and the footage I shot disappeared at Water and Maiden in front of a T-Mobile store. There's also bitcoin stickers in the backpack with other items.I guess I'll check Craigslist every now and then? Meanwhile I'll have to rebuy new gear and reshoot. Can I blame this whole thing on bitcoin?

Yea, the problem is that most honest people wouldn't take it, even to turn it in, and eventually a theif is bound to see it...

There would be security video in front of that <truncated>

Topic: US hits credit limit: Good news for the USD/BTC exchange?
### Original post:
I wondered what you guys think of this tidbit on the news.<link> raise the value of BTC even more?

### Reply 1:
I think it's great news for BTC in the long run. When people start piling out of the USD, they will turn to all sorts of alternatives. Gold, silver, foreign currencies, and of course BTC. I hope we see lots of currency competition. That being said, there's not really a credit limit. If a bunch of people can sit in a room and enough of them raise their hands and the limit is increased, then it's not much of a limit. If I max out my credit card, it gets declined when I try to use it. I cannot vote to extend my credit line. If the government maxes out its credit card, it can vote to extend its credit line, as of course it will.

### Reply 2:
It's not ""news"" really as this was a known event which markets were expecting. What WON'T be expected is if the August 2 date comes and goes and no deal is reached in Washington to raise the debt limit.Of course, they WILL raise the debt limit, as everyone expects.What it means for Bitcoin is simply that the road to USD collapse is ever-nearer and announcements like the US hitting the ceiling once again highlight this perilous future. In the midst of a collapse of US currency, every alternative currency from other fiats like the Euro to metals to maybe even stocks themselves will be in demand to fill the monetary void left by the dollar. Bitcoin may be perfectly timed, in that sense.Let's hope the USD collapse happens AFTER Bitcoin is really ready for prime time... however that may be defined.

What do you think guys how much posetive effect this news gives us on bitcoin

### Reply 1:
For those who don't know, Amazon secured domains several years ago. So the topic was or is now certainly already discussed. I am sure that it was already a topic of discussion in several meetings. And as an innovative company, you have to deal with crypto. Domains: amazonethereum.com, <truncated> amazonbitcoin.com and, <truncated> I think it's a matter of time before acceptance for cryptocurrencies is made official.

### Reply 2:
They did that so that scammers can't register those domains to run a fake ""Free amazon giveaway"" or ""free Jeff Bezos giveaway"" and scam people using their name.No company registers these types of domains to accept crypto payments, they do that on the main site!

Topic: Halloween inspired poll would your Bitcoins get passed on if you suddenly died?
### Original post:
Recurrently, we discuss on methods to store our Bitcoins/Sats (et al), and how we would pass them on in case we kicked the bucket right now, on-the-spot. Im not specifically interested here on discovering the different conceptual plans each one has, but rather to toy around with the scenario of suddenly passing away. Lets be honest, people make plans in their minds, but many less actually have those contingency plans developed and tested, to the level that one is confident that their heirs will actually be able to access their Bitcoins. Another completely (yet related) question would be, whether they would not only manage to access them, but to keep them in custody, move them, sell them without messing-up, but Im merely focusing on being able to access them here, staying in disposition to do whatever with them at a later stage.So the basic question in the poll is not about what you have in mind, but of what would really happen if you suddenly passed away right nowNote1: The proximity of Halloween retriggered the question in my mind today, alongside this thread: What happens to my bitcoin if I die today? Note2: select the closest percentage value from those available in the poll opt<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
I made a topic on this a while ago and I need to get back to syorying this.At the moment, they'd manage to get half but I used to have a time locked transaction that could execute to my main wallet they'd have access to so that the coins could be spent after an amount of time (eg 10 years).

### Reply 2:
I never gave much effort to learn the time lock transaction. Assuming before that certain time one can not spend the coins. Is it even if they know the private key of the address?I think with bitcoin we overcomplicate things or maybe not. In a regular banking system the beneficiary normally knows you bank details. So can't they take off your money even when you are alive?For me the fare is that if my next of kin will be able to securely handle the coins I will left.

Topic: The cost of bitcoin system is too high.it is not a cheap payment at all.
### Original post:
Bitcoin(PoW) need hash race,and,many computer work,but just one computer's working is effective at one time.Compare to mainframe used in banks,the cost of Bitcoin is much more higher.Now transaction fee is low because the cost of system is undertake by people who buy bitcoins,not people who use bitcoins.One block gives miner 25 new coins now,but new coin's production rate is reducing,more and more people will find the cost of bitcoin is too high.What about PoSPoS is better,but not good enough.POS do not need hash race,but also one computer's working is effective at one time.And,it is not fair to miner,The output does not relative to hardware input.If people use virtual currency million times per second,the money spend on computing deviceI/O deviceelectricity bills must not be ignored.Hardware cost/total cost higher,profit rate lower.the money spend on hardware is same,so rich investors will get higher profit rate.Only miner who has many coins is going to mine,it will lead to concentrate.

### Reply 1:
It is needed in Bitcoin system,but not needed in bank or visa system.So how does Bitcoin compete wiht banks and visa etc.

### Reply 2:
Of course,it is Bitcoin's advantage.But I I doubt how many people will be going to use Bitcoin if transactioin fee is 30 dollars in 2030.And,it's not just advantage.Bitcoin is free currency,if Bitcoin is lost or hacked,no one can get it back.

Calling me a ""designer"" is giving me a bit too much credit. :-) I took one of the Casascius designs and figured out how to change the colors. The rest is a matter of knocking together a shell script that spits out some PostScript to print multiple notes on a page; I'm more comfortable with that sort of work than with anything that requires much in the way of artistic ability.

Becoming your own bank wouldn't have been possible, until Satoshi Nakamoto can up with a brilliant idea. Third party interference has been a major issue affecting those who are not part of the governmental system, making them feel almost less important especially when it comes to accessing their own deposits.Been your own banks literally gives you the same authority that financial institutions (banks) posses, such as:1. Sending money to anyone around the world with out intercountry restrictions.2. Sending any amount unlike banks that gives limit3. Acting as a third party in approving your own transactions, etc.The volatile nature of this form of money makes it a suitable investment option for those that believes in it. Interestingly, price increase and price decrease are both different opportunities that favors it's users. When the price goes up, those in possession makes decent profit for themselves depending on how much they bought and how many they've acquired. When the price drops, people sees it as an opportunity to accumulate more. I would say that Bitcoin is indeed a marvelous piece of art.Is there anything more interesting than becoming your own bank, approving your own tra<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
I would rather say having control over your own funds(that's if you use decentralized mediums to store your funds) yes, Bitcoin is serving these purposes and many more. Alot of person has decided to adobt Bitcoin as a store of value, because of the freedom it give. Just as you've stated it has help make cross border transactions possible and with ease. Banks on the other hand has lots of processing to complete for one to send money across his countries border. But if we look at it from what you've said, being your own bank. It no longer follows that way anymore because today, we now have centralized bodies that helps other keep their funds. Similar to the banks. So the idea is that what ever freedom you've choose to get using Bitcoin depends on how you've decided to store it.

### Reply 2:
Frankly, I did not understand the idea you are trying to convey, but in general, there are some incorrect points you mentioned.Not everyone can confirm or reject a transaction except those who have mining devices connected to mining pools, and even those cannot reject a transaction as long as it is compatible with the network protocol, and even if they refuse, there are other pools that will accept these transactions.If you use closed source wallets, leave your money in third-party custody services, in CEXs, then you are not becoming your own bank.

Topic: How do you guys get updated on coin developments
### Original post:
Where do you guys read development updates on coins? It appears tough to find such news in an ocean of shilling/FOMO and FUD. I just would like to concentrate on coin development instead of spending time reading all the noise. We have to go into each thread here to get updated information on each coin. Instead, I would like to read the coin headings and get to know the updates. Some (news) website should definitely provide help. Any ideas guys?

### Reply 1:
Check their Bitcointalk page, website, twitter, telegram and always read their whitepaper. You can read comments in Bitcointalk and somebody will share some interesting news or link about a coin that you find attractive for investing. You don't need to read every single post. You would lose your will, just the important stuff. Filter information.

### Reply 2:
Thanks for your reply. I would do the same if I were to research on a particular coin. But, how do you find the one. I would like to read about all coin developments and then pick the exciting ones. I am talking about firstly finding such coins. If there is a website/post/thread which only talks coin developments with heading highlighting (reddit is good. But 1 out of 100 posts talk about coin development) that would be great. eg: ""walton has new partnership with xyz"".

Topic: he pays 5000  for a bitcoin transfer
### Original post:

### Reply 1:
It was a very large transaction combining bitcoins from about 640 inputs. The sender could have saved a lot of money by waiting for fees to drop and paying 10 sats/vb rather than 100 sats/vb.However, I notice that even when fees are low, there are still transactions paying fees of around 100 sats/vb. I bet those are exchanges that charge users a fee when withdrawing. They don't care what the fee is because the users pay it.

### Reply 2:
Just imagine you've earned the bitcoin over many years and now you see them turn into about $50,000 - Ask yourself - would you be willing to sweep your funds to enable you to cash out - but have to pay 10% in transfer fees to ensure the funds went where you want them to the same day?I paid 20 sats per byte yesterday to send a TX and it's already confirmed.

Topic: Should the Bitcoin Foundation be moved to a Neutral Country...
### Original post:
In light of recent [1] events [2] (namely a member of Bitcoin Fundation suggesting that we should diffrentiate between ""Good Bitcoins"" and ""Bad Bitcoins""), it becomes more and more obvious that the worst enemy of Bitcoin is the Bitcoin Foundation:There are probably strong political pressures from USA which not only has very aggressive AML policies, but clearly is going in the direction of Fascism and Socialism while becoming more and more anti-democratic.So what is the point of keeping Bitcoin Foundation in a country which is (or will be soon) an enemy of Bitcoin ?Perhaps a truly democratic country should be used, such as Switzerland.What do you think ?

### Reply 1:
Bitcoin and Bitcoin Foundation should not be supporters of the establishment.

### Reply 2:
i'd like to see some live debates on youtube for these hard issueslots of polling the community by the Foundation before they decide anything and draw up a constitution, outlining the core values of the communityI feel the foundation is no longer representing the communities interest, they simply want to do wtv is necessary to get bitcoin ""approved for mainstream use"", when it seem clear to me that the community could not care less about conforming to the US rules even if it would make us all rich, we have values and they are not for sale! the Foundation MUST reflect that

Topic: McAfees MGT Goes Into Bitcoin Mining, With Massive Amount of Hardware
### Original post:
To date, MGT has mined over 90 Bitcoins so far, at $611 each. At this exchange rate, MGT has earned over $50,000 in mining revenue and is continuing its mining operations. Now, MGT is beginning Phase Two of its mining plans and hopes to reach 5 PetaHash of mining power by the end of 2016s fourth quarter.I'm not that much into mining so I can't say for sure how big is 5 PetaHash but I consider it as a good thing , that way , chinese mining farms will have less control on the market.source : <link>

### Reply 1:
That's not a bad mining power, however it is still peanuts compared to the rest of the network. I don't know how long they've been going at it, but regardless of however long it has been as long as their at least getting a net positive return on their work so far I don't think they'll stop.5 PH/s, as I said, is ehh.

### Reply 2:
When did they start?If they're making more than 50 BTC per month, I say it's good. I wonder how much they invested. If they think long term, and don't have the need to sell fast what they're making, they will be successful. I would be happy to do the same thing, but you need serious money to become a miner nowadays.

### Original post:
What do you think ?

### Reply 1:
Yeah. As people have realized that the amount of bitcoin is limited and it would get precious with the time, people are holding more than ever.The decrease in active supply is also due to freezing of coins for BTC backed tokens like wrapped BTC and others as well freezed coins on Lightning network. There are also different hedge funds that are freezing their coins.

### Reply 2:
Yes , totally agreed , but at the same time I would like to address an issue that Arrises because of this fact , apparently the Whales tries and generates false alarms by sending Bitcoins from one wallet to another , which in-turn causes panic for the newbies and to other people. This is something that is more or so used by the bulls to scare the investors , make them panic sell/buy then encash when the time is right for them , therefore I won't ask you to ever follow these things . You can actually check the market price every now and then and then make a suitable investment, because at the end of the day , literally no one can predict what is going to happen in the market . I do think in the upcoming years we will have *competition* as a major factor for determination of the market price , we do need certain updates for the same , I do hope we solve the issues with the lightning network . People often read stories about how people became billionaires overnight band all and then come and Invest in Bitcoins , cannot wait for long and then at the end of the day complain here , remember some of those people waited from 2009 all the way till 2017 . _Patience is the Key_

Topic: is a bitcoin shopping cart realistic?
### Original post:
I plan to offer an electrum bitcoin payment address to an online shopping cart for services rendered. Roughly once a week forward the coin in the wallet to an exchange and cash out. I am not so much interested in playing the high/low market strategies for bitcoin, mainly collecting payments and cashing out. What is the best way to do this? Should I do it daily, weekly, monthly? is there a preferred exchange for businesses? Are there any other considerations?

### Reply 1:
In addition to what has been mentioned above, you have CoinGate and CoinsBank as well.Note that using a payment processor will mean paying fees for each transaction you receive. If you don't want to do that, you could setup BTCPayServer but you'll receive everything in BTC and you'll have to exchange yourself.

### Reply 2:
It is obvious that Bitcoin is being used by manipulators and big people who knows what they are doing to gain a lot of money from it.

one of the mayor drawback of Bitcoin is the long waiting for confirmation.I wonder why no the system just, lets say, to increase confirmation speed by 4, target*4 for 24 blocks/hour, reduce the block reward by 4, 50/4=12.5, and increase the number of blocks for reducing the reward *4.That will also help to promote solo mining a bit more.

From the headlines in the papers to the top story in tonights news coverage, every now and then people talk about bitcoin, be it about a new service that accepts it or a rise or fall in exchange rates. for me, i will consider it in my business for 3 reasons:1. ITS SIMPLE2. ITS FAST AND SECURE3. ITS CHEAPERso how about you, mind if you share your thoughts.. it'll be much appreciated.thanks!

### Reply 1:
Those 3 points are the reason why business have started adopting bitcoin. This phenomenon will keep growing and we can see more businesses offering support for bitcoin. This will be a win win situation for the sellers and buyers. It will increasing the amount of users for bitcoin, which can lead to price stability. It's good that you have started this thread and I look forward to read more comments and ideas about how any businesses can adopt bitcoin effectively.

### Reply 2:
If businesses are going to make use of bitcoins, it means the price of their goods/service will keep fluctuating along with bitcoin. Some might find this a bit stressful.

Topic: What if Cryptos are Classified as Securities
### Original post:
A lot of debate has been going on in various countries about classifying crypto tokens as securities and bringing them under regulations that are at par with instruments that are classified as securities. And now with more money from the institutions seems to be seeping into crypto markets, the debates in the regulatory corridors around the world become rifer.let know your views... refference <link>

### Reply 1:
If Cryptos are classified into securities then I think it's acceptance will be increased largely. People will be able to restore their faith into it and invest here. The regulations that will be put into it may not be always in favor of crypto but hopefully it will not go much against it. Beside I think accepting it by putting regulation is much better than banning.

### Reply 2:
I think this is a very realistic scenario. ICO projects are not waiting for the best time. I think there will be an opportunity to get the security status of a token. Those who do not want to do this will have big problems.

In every industry or market, there will always be people whom many loves and many hates. And in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, there is no exemption here. While hating is not a good business, expressing some dislike can be a healthy one. As far as being hated, I can think of at least two personalities, and we know why many don't like them: Roger Ver the man behind BitcoinCash and of course Craig Wright who earned the moniker as ""faketoshi"" as he is continually claiming to be the real guy and behind the Bitcoin SV (the original Bitcoin, according to its site). Can you add more, please.

Topic: Visa: We make it possible to buy bitcoins using Visa
### Original post:
An increasing the demand of bitcoin we hear some good new everyday about the companies accepting and using bitcoin. The Visa CEO 'Alfred Kelly' announced in an interview that Visa is entering the crypto currency. He said: We try to do two things; The first is to make it possible to buy Bitcoin with Visa credit cards, and the second is to work with Bitcoin wallets to quickly convert Bitcoin to Fiat currency so that it can be used in the 70 million places in the world that Visa supports.Kelly believes there is ""strong potential"" for crypto currencies to become new payment system. What's your thoughts? Source: <link>

### Reply 1:
Have been hearing this for quite sometime but havent seen any positive progress yet. I think such decisions are above these CEO and mostly government and Central banks have authority over Visa/MasterCard etc.But isnt it already there? If he mean to dont charge extra fees then good step.Otherwise they treat it as investment and charge big percentage of fees almost 10%. I did used once and after one month in my statement there was 10% fee against investment when I inquired they told me you invested in stocks. I said ok, I mean Thats something I would agree to, Yes it is the new payment system.

### Reply 2:
I think I've heard of that news before, maybe not a long time ago but this isn't new. What I can say is, if they'll give that feature for their users to convert quickly received bitcoin into fiat, that's the worry of most users. They are still into cash and that's the only thing they need to secure. The confidence that they can convert received bitcoin into fiat will remove their doubts towards it, and this is for those no coiners that think that bitcoin is a scam and only used illegally.

Bitfinex, on February 20 2018, announced support for bitcoin deposit and withdrawals using P2SH Segregated Witness (SegWit) addresses while GDAX, on February 23, introduced a phased rollout for all its customers. By early March, both exchanges had successfully transitioned their entire infrastructure from legacy bitcoin addresses to SegWit compatible ones.Importantly, the adoption of SegWit by exchanges came only after the entire cryptocurrency community clamored for it in a bid to reduce bitcoin fees. Nevertheless, after ignoring much of the demand for transaction batching and SegWit since the latters release in August 2017, it seems as if the exchanges are finally taking user feedback much more seriously.Source: <link>

### Reply 1:
If segwit be implemented on all levels of bitcoin activities, business then a fast transaction and lesser fee will open the doors of the merchantile world to bitcoin. Bitcoin mainstreaming will be possible if bitcoin will have less fee and fast transaction confirmation. Though we may not feel it today but businesses are starting to accept and adopt bitcoin on the different parts of the world.

### Reply 2:
I am just a bit surprised that SegWit adoption seems so slow - we should long time ago go full SegWit.Instead, <truncated> spent more time arguing whether SegWit is good or not...If we follow the same path with LightningNetwork then I don't expect it will go live in the next 10 years.

Topic: Bitcoin Transaction Fee
### Original post:
During April, I saw a tremendous increase in bitcoin transaction fee. I think there are enough people who want to make fast transaction that they are willing to pay miner more than usual. Quite a few people seem in a hurry to get their turn for confirmation in the next block, so anyone who wants to send a small transaction has to be patient for a longer turn. I hope the mempool can be cleaned up as soon as possible, but if the panic of trader and investor continues then maybe these expensive fee will last longer.Here are some of the data I collect from <link> about bitcoin transaction fee.

### Reply 1:
If you want your transaction to get confirmed on time I guess you are left with no choice than to opt for a higher transaction fee, the situation is tough on both btc and eth network, untill this is resolved (in the eth aspect) people will continue to pay higher price to get transaction proceed immediately.

### Reply 2:
Ransaction fees on the Bitcoin network has often given no challenges except for cases of large cluster and then the need arises for prioritizing gas fees which in turn drives the fees up by a significant percentage. I think the concept of lightening network will help solve the issues of fees in the near future, pending when he hat is deployed, we will keep at what comes and rely on devs to help remedy it with upgrades.

Topic: How would this affect Bitcoin in a few years?
### Original post:
Intel is already starting to test the smallest chip for quantum computing. How would this affect Bitcoin in a few years? bitcoin should start right now to work seriously with the security of its network to avoid disaster.

### Reply 1:
Let's say they've successfully made it and became reliable, so in next few years we could expect that Intel can do whatever it likes to Bitcoin . A 51% or higher computational power would be too easy for them to conduct an attack on the network.Well, I'm not a technical guy and I really have no clue how the core developers can adjust on this threat. Quantum computer poses a threat only on the encryption. I misread the article below..For some references since the OP didn't include any:Quantum Computing Becoming RealQuantum Computers Pose Imminent Threat to Bitcoin SecurityOn a side note, so it would be possible also to generate a complete character case sensitive bitcoin address using a quantum computer.

They have to advertise their services somehow! They can't just place banner ads or run a signature campaign on bitcointalk because I don't think anybody would participate and they would probably be bashed to hell with their accounts neg-tagged Their audience are also not here. So when they pay these news outlets to publish some nonsense about bitcoin and their services, they are practically advertising their services and to a better audience.""the US Department of Justice announced it had reclaimed almost all the Bitcoin. ~ FBI had tracked the ransom Colonial paid to an address tied to DarkSide, a Russia-linked cybercrime group associated with the attackers, and swooped in to seize it.""hmmm. they should have mentioned some other country that US has some jurisdiction not Russia where they don't!

### Reply 2:
Companies that do chainalysis are more or less providing a service that anyone with enough time and money can do themselves.Anyone can follow transactions on a block explorer and follow notes to known addresses for exchanges and people. Add in getting the information from other centralized services and it becomes more difficult. But still possible.What they do do is provide 2 things.1) A nice PR for the government agency when they show they are protecting you by hiring people to find this stolen, or obtained through fraud or whatever BTC2) They are the fall guy when they get it wrong, ""We didn't do anything wrong, we hired the best company we could find""-Dave

Of course, everyone should be responsible because its our own money anyways. We are our own bank. We know that risk that's why we take every precautions that is in the book, although hackers and criminals will do anything, but we need to be step ahead of the game.And we do our share of partaking the knowledge to that newbies. We all been preaching how to protect themselves, but it really depends on the person. At least we have given them guidance from the very start so that they don't have the right to bitch out when they lost their money in a exchanges or in their wallets.

Topic: Bitcoin Confidence Test
### Original post:
Hello Everyone,Most of us have Bitcoin but how much we trust Bitcoin?My offer is very simple, f someone want to buy all Bitcoin in your hand and pay for each Bitcoin 25k USD. Do you accept or reject. But there is one simple rule: You will never buy Crypto currency again.The purpose of this survey is to measure our confidence in Bitcoin. I think through this survey we can see how much we trust the future of Bitcoin.Let's see how much we trust Bitcoin.Thanks for participating !!!

### Reply 1:
Just a note to you OP. We can ""trust"" Bitcoin, the protocol, even if we're not confident that the price will go up. Price is not an indicator of it's success in the first place.Anyway, for your question, no. I won't sell. Bitcoin reached somewhere around $19,000 in 2017. While the saying ""Past Performance Is Not Indicative Of Future Results"" is at play here, I think it's very likely for Bitcoin to reach $25k, and even a lot higher when we're talking about the long term. It's just a matter of when.

### Reply 2:
I wouldn't sell it simply because it prevents me from buying ANY cryptocurrency. If you forbade me from buying ONLY Bitcoin, I'd sell in an instant.But I love altcoins.

### Reply 1:
These people are really crazy for overpaying the Bitcoin fees in order to get their worthless NFT, due to decentralized Bitcoin network, there's no way to reject it and the miners obviously prefer to broadcast the transactions for people who willing to pay higher.But I think this ordinals is just a hype, I guess a year later people will not really interested again and the transaction will be cheaper, but it can't back like when before ordinals attack started. The current situation like forcing people to adopt lightning network.

### Reply 2:
The fact that you have to ask this question proves you haven't seen my proposals ergo we did need a new topic.To summarize the way to prevent this attack should have been the same method we have been using forever to prevent similar attacks and exploits. It could have been introduction of standard rules that would have made such malicious transactions non-standard hence majority of full nodes would have refused to relay them and that would have successfully prevented this attack from growing.Standard rules are easy to implement too since they don't need a fork, we just had to get full nodes to run a patch for their old clients or run the newest release to enforce the new rule.However, I don't see this method being effective anymore considering how the scam has grown big and the market size of it is considerable enough to encourage the scammers to run full nodes themselves without enforcing the said standard rule to relay their spam. There is also incentive for them to pay the miners behind the scene to mine their malicious transactions.At this point I'm afraid we need a soft fork to make these transactions invalid/illegal as part of the consensus rules which is much more challengin<rest of post truncated>

Topic: Bitcoin the anonymous cryptocurrency
### Original post:
Message from anonymous bitcoin community members for other members explaining how bitcoin is working for the last ten years. Its a platform developed for entire humanity by humans. The protocol is robust enough to defend itself against all hacks. Even the developers of the protocol can't change or manipulate it. It is very likely that the developers of this protocol are with us all the time.What we need is to stay safe in this current crisis, as this crisis will be over just like all crises of history. Be safe!

### Reply 1:
One thing I like about bitcoin is its anonymity, ease of use, peer-to-peer payment, and its less volatility. All these said are just not enough about bitcoin. It is truly a safe haven for holders and also a way of investing. About the anonimity you talked about, it is true. I have three wallets that require no verification, no email and remain non-custodian generating different public addresses anytime I want to make a transaction. Even, if my transaction is tracked or traced, I still remain anonymous because it can not be linked to my identity. I love bitcoin for this. @mk4 Please, why did you say bitcoin is psydonumouse? With what I know about bitcoin, it is not pseudonymous at all. It can be anonymous if you choose too. If you choose a verified wallet makes it to be non anonymous but there are many wallets like Trezor, Ledger Nano, coinomi, and many other wallets that do not even require you of email address and the anonymity remains the main goal.

### Reply 2:
Probably a way to say ""we are all Satoshi Nakamoto"", but it still sounds pretty bad to use his name this way.. We will get past the crisis, but it's gonna be a long path until we get there. It's gonna be ""fun"" until all things end..

Topic: Do we need regulation based on morality?
### Original post:
The nice and funny incidents about a pool operator bragging about his actions of smashing an alt coin by using his pool for it resulted in wild discussions. As far as I understood it, the alt coin fans/users were damaged but the miners at his pool not interested in that particular alt coin were not directly damaged as merged mining comes at no costs.I see it difficult to talk about morality in bitcoin and see the task as to design it in a way that we don't need morality as greed or dogmatism will always find its way. Still I'm interested in your opinion on the issue. How much of their clearly existing power should pool operators be tolerated to use.Let me know if I should add further options.

### Reply 1:
I'd say as long as they're open about it, they can do whatever they want.

### Reply 2:
If the people are moral the strict free market regulations will reflect their morality.. As long as you are transparent I have no problem with whatever you choose to do.

Topic: When Bitcoin Maximalists are Promoting/Shilling an Altcoin
### Original post:
Just the other day, a SEC-approved tokenized IPO was launched by INX, a crypto exchange. The token is built on the Ethereum network.Everything seems pretty normal. But no, this is a whole different security token not so much for its features as the people who are promoting/shilling it and even sitting as Advisory Board Members. They are no less than Bitcoin maximalists who openly despise altcoins as shitcoins including ETH itself. And now, all of a sudden, this promotion. A whole controversial drama has ensued. Stefan Jespers, known on Twitter as WhalePanda with the description: ""Toxic Monetary Bitcoin Maximalist""[1] and whose Linkedin profile states that ""He will not give you investment advice and he will not endorse your ICO.""[2] recently tweeted:(<link> the cyberphunk, Jameson Lopp, creator of statoshi.info, bitcoin.page, lightning.how, has also tweeted:(<link> turned out the two, among other Bitcoin maximalists which include Samson Mow, chief officer of Blockstream, and Alena Vranova, founder of SatoshiLabs, are advisors of the project.[3](<link> decision made by these quite popular Bitcoin influencers and enthusiasts did not bode well to some Bitcoin fans.Hodlonaut.hodl on Twi<rest of post truncated>

This is exactly why I hate hypocrites. They trash something they are not part of and all of a sudden an ERC20 token is okay just because they have acquired something in their pockets. It shows how their judgement is easily corruptible.What cobra twitted was spot on.

Topic: Before You Send Your Bitcoin To Hardware Wallets I Do This!
### Original post:
Not your keys, Not your coins but You should know this before moving your coins from CEXs, because most of you buy hardware wallets and use them right away without first testing them. Many Bitcoiners have lost their funds in the past due to a bad hardware wallet because they neglected to employ these easy crypto techniques; Do not trust, Only Verify!!! Step 1. Don't send your Bitcoin to a hardware wallet until you've thoroughly tested it. Taking your entire Bitcoin balance from your Exchange wallet and sending it to your ledger( cold storage ) without knowing what you're doing is extremely risky. First, you ought to send a small amount of bitcoin to your hardware wallet. Keep an eye out for it to appear there. Wipe your hardware wallet clean, factory reset it, and re-enter your seed phrase into your hardware wallet, plug it back into your computer, and check to see if your bitcoins are still sitting in your wallet as you believe. Step 2. Then send it back to the exchange. Check that you can receive and send Bitcoin, that you can wipe your device, that you can re-enter your seed phrase, and that everything still works. Do this with the smallest amount you can afford to lose; it is b<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Did you lose funds? If yes, then to which hardware wallet? Actually, this is something totally new to me, and I did not know that we have to take that much precaution before making any transaction in a wallet. I tried to do some research but did not find any cases reported.Well, if that's the case, then I will keep your words in mind next time and try to warn others too. Recently, I came to know that hardware wallets go dead if they are not in use for more than 1 year, and I am very shocked to learn this.And I said that hardware wallets are not in a perfect state even after this much progress in technology. But still, there is room to grow.

### Reply 2:
This is wrong approach! Do not trust only Verify! Reputation can be bought. No, I did not lose my coins. But this is a regular procedure for me whenever I get a new hardware wallet; I also use it on my hot wallet to check if the seed phrase I put down is correct. Create a new wallet, backup your seed phrase, then delete and import it again to ensure you have the correct backup.Never heard.

Probably they're just buying because they have the means to. These whales will want to dominate the market ad much as possible and i will not tie their action as a sign of the next bull run. Sheesh, the Bitcoin halving event is like a prophecy that's bound to be fulfilled and just like @Odohu pointed, any investor who believes in the prospects Bitcoin holds will want to take advantage of the low price now.

Hello buddies, It would be sad story if our bitcoin get scammed.

Sorry for lose. I got scammed by gox for a decent chunk of bitcoin so i know how it feels. I will say i took into account my money was at high risk though i just thought it would be OK with the information i knew at the time. Obviously i couldn't have been further wrong. Now im way more careful.

Topic: Uzbekistan issues a decree to adopt a special cryptographic framework.
### Original post:
Once again, the Republic of Uzbekistan speaks out again as far as cryptocurrencies are concerned, moving forward with local cryptocurrency regulations by Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev.On Wednesday, he published a decree explaining that it Promoted that residents of Uzbekistan could trade with any type of cryptocurrency in 2021.The decree also indicated that the new entity called the National Agency for Perspective Projects (NAPP), will be able to establish legal conditions for entities that use cryptographic and blockchain technology, including cryptocurrency mining companies.It should be noted that the agency also licenses and supervises virtual asset service providers, where they must pay a series of state fees These incomes are subject to Personal Income Tax at a fixed rate of 7.5%. What do you think of the new imposed decree and all that it will imply?Source of information: <link>

### Reply 1:
I think they are trying to do a lot of things which may be difficult to implement. It's good if the people running the new agency are actually capable.It looks like they want to control everything from trading to mining from what I read in a separate article.- They plan to make crypto become ""more local"" which means no buying or selling on international exchanges. I don't know how the locals would take that since they are probably used to the liquidity of international exchanges like Binance. These local exchanges will be required to retain your personal data for five years.- It is also said that local exchanges are not allowed to list anonymous coins and they are most likely referring Monero.- Mining companies are encouraged to used solar energy only and will pay twice the electricity should they connect to the national grid.<link>

### Reply 2:
Additional security like what?It is up to people to be responsible for their own money. It isn't up to a government to tell people how to manage their cryptocurrencies. When the saying goes ""Be your own bank"" it also includes, and more specifically, the responsibilities that go with it. If they don't know how to protect their money, they shouldn't even be using cryptos.7.5% is the average tax rate in this country for something other than their job (which is 23% according to this link) so nothing special about the rate since it's normal to themBitcoin was never banned I believe, and people could use it freely. So making it legal doesn't make much difference to them.In fact, this news isn't really news at all, because there was a decree issued about three years ago saying much the same thing. So nothing new really. On the other hand, both are mainly about collecting taxes and regulating companies (so that they can collect more tax money)

Topic: 12.5BTC GUARANTEE APRROXIMATLY EVERY 10MINS
### Original post:
Bitcoin is such a fascinating technology, it seeks to solve the long aged problem associated with the traditional banking system, through a decentralized peer-peer trusted network called the blockchain. Bitcoin is just similar to gold that people are willing to pay anything for in the hope of future appreciation in overall value. while the dollar is backed by government legislation, and has no commodity backing it up. But the bitcoin is been backed by proof-of-work. For example, when the government needs money, they simply print, and when there is no production or export of goods to meet up with the excess cash, it gives rise to high-inflation, or even hyperinflation like in the case of Zimbabwe wherein money failed and their currency became useless. The case will not be so with bitcoin as we already know that it's programmed in such a way to have a fixed supply of 21million bitcoin in it entire life. It will be wise for anyone to buy as much as they can and keep them for the future. Some pundit, IT gurus and economics think and believe some billions of the world population will use bitcoin in the future, let's think about what this will be like when this prediction comes to pass. <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Are you sure that is how BTC mining works? I thought the BTC supply is already identified which is around 21M and that miners will going to mine BTC if there are transaction being made which it called as transaction fee. This fee is in terms of BTC for the miners and some for the the exchange and this will be deducted in every BTC transaction. Am I right?

### Reply 2:
its more like in 2009 bitcoin started off with CREATING 50 new coins for every block solved. which every 210,000 blocks(~4 years) the reward halved. this in human terms means roughly ever 4 years the reward goes as follows50coins each block for 210,000 blocks25coins each block for 210,000 blocks12.5coins each block for 210,000 blocks6.25coins each block for 210,000 blocksand so on. until the decimal(satoshi) level is so small it cant be halved, which will happen in the year ~2140adding it all up means that roughly but not exactly 21mill coins would have been created by ~2140.as for the tx fee. this was a later after thought as a way to deter spamming blocks with thousands of transactions of useless utility. by making it cost something to add a transaction to a block. the fee's are not creating new coins, but spending existing coins. thus at the moment pools can create 12.5 coins for solving a block and as a bonus get X existing coins for adding transactions to the blockand to clarify the topics mis understanding about the block timing/difficulty adjustingthe technicals is more so that there is a rule in which every 2016 blocks, if made under or over 2 weeks. the difficulty is adjus<rest of post truncated>

Topic: Did institutional investors poised as actors in crypto industry?
### Original post:
Well, this idea comes from my little mind to think upon this institutional investors acting upon the opportunities of crypto industry.Which off course, getting enough attention to the market, knowing that they exist and makes crypto-world; an image of opportunity for everyone. The decentralized nature of cryptocurrency makes everyone think their investments are safe from prying government and central banks.They may like typical investors but most of these institutional investors are whales in the market and hadn't move any cryptocurrency at inception of their buying period. Make sense, cause they are hodling all the coins in the crypto market, in every points and every entries. Well off course, its not our big concern; and yes we point the answer, but I want to think how curious you are about crypto industry? And how aware you are?LINK

As for me, the best thing is to trust your cryptocurrency to trusted sources. The other day I asked myself the question of currency exchange and I was pretty well helped with this. Especially crypto trading platform is a very relevant thing today.

Why mixed? It's great news. You can't expect retailers to keep the coins after a completed sale. Volatility is too heavy for that. Perhaps the time will come that they see the benefit of keeping the coins instead of using a third party to convert everything.

### Reply 2:
Thank you for sharing this news!For ''brighter'' future of bitcoin we need more such good news.Until this happen, average potential users will mostly see bitcoin as investment, not like ''real'' money.We really need a lot ''big'' merchants in order to finally become mainstream.

Nowadays Bitcoin mining activities have become more efficient and greener compared to several years ago. Many Bitcoin miners have started using renewable energy to support their Bitcoin mining activities, and this provides a good opportunity to reduce the carbon footprint of Bitcoin mining globally. The facts show that energy usage in Bitcoin mining is even lower than banking (<link> <truncated> so attacking Bitcoin because of its energy use and environmental sustainability issues is just propaganda made up to distort people's views on Bitcoin.

Nevertheless, one of my goals is TO LIVE ONLY USING BITCOINS or cryptocurrencies in general. Of course this process will be gradually implemented, since I must plan and think about many different variables, and here is where I really need your expertise. Unfortunately, as far as I see on the web, there are very few commercial stores in Berlin which accept BitCoins, even if I focussed my atention just in some restaurants and bars, since for now I will need mainly food and some basic services.I have enough faith that cryptocurrencie<rest of post truncated>

Coinmarketcap is the site that hosts the price for listed Cryptocurrency coins and tokens. Other sites like coingecko and coinpaprika are available.

In addition to seeing that it connects in a 4+ network with that OP title, I thought that we were going to find a kind of information that refers to how some sites ""make up"" their movements based on their own interests and not that of the collective based on real movements of users .As mentioned by some posts before, this change happened a long time ago, I did not know that 8 months ago but I did comment something on my local board about it in September.Sometimes some new things that we see depend on the frequency in which we do it, with the ATH many are returning to that frequency.

Im Kevin and I'm the guy who bought 259684 BTC for under $3000 yesterday. I really wanted to keep this as quiet as possible, but I don't feel I can anymore. Here's my side of what happened.On an exchange like MtGox, there are typically hundreds of standing ""buy orders"" where people are offering to buy bitcoins at various amounts and prices. When a large sell order comes in, an exchange will start with the highest priced buy order, match up the buyer and seller, then move down to the next lowest buy order. This repeats until the entire quantity of bitcoins being sold have found buyers, or there are no more buyers at the minimum price the seller was willing to accept.I was watching, like many of you, a gigantic sell order burning through the bids. Mt Gox doesn't execute trades very quickly, so we were watching this huge order slowly eat up every buy order on the books. The price started at around $17.50, and within minutes was below $10. At this point, I realized this wasn't merely a large seller willing to accept some losses. This was someone attempting to crash the market by selling a huge percentage of the market's total bitcoins at once.I had around $3000 USD in my Mt Gox account<rest of post truncated>

Debt owners do not get that privilege but are guaranteed to receive their money in case of bankruptcy. The shareholders of the company are the sole owners of the means of production in a company and benefit of this position by exploiting workers with an unfair salary.

Yesterday some fiend told me Bitcoin is consuming too much energy for miners to confirms each transaction and this can't be good. Surely, you have encountered the argument of bitcoin critics/haters that bitcoin consumes a lot of electricity and energy. If you encounter this argument again, show them this statistic!As you can see on the picture above, bitcoin is consuming less energy and helps saving natural resources. While, the traditional banking system and printing the fiat consumes much more energy comparing to Bitcoin.

### Reply 1:
It would be great if the source is mentioned though. The calculation method also has to be explained so we're talking on the same ground. For example, what is counted by ""fiat printing"", what makes it different from the banking system, etc.Nice graphics btw.

### Reply 2:
From this images,we come to know many new facts.The banking system had consuming more electricity then a bitcoin mining.Their was FUD about the usage of electricity for the mining of bitcoin.So we a traders can claim our people,we are not only responsible for the more use of the electricity by the mean of mining.

Topic: Security risks of BSV hardfork;  Wright trying to add the same to Bitcoin
### Original post:
<link>

### Reply 1:
This is worrisome, but I hope that if it's the case, larger pockets - MicroStrategy, Grayscale, COPA - would chip in. This would at least help Bitcoin (and those companies' investments).But indeed, if we get there, open source may also be badly (and sadly) affected. That's not OK. Well, all this is not OK. I still fail to understand how can any country's legal system take serious CSW. Maybe Hodlonaut's case can be referenced though from now on for a bit of background...

### Reply 2:
There was/is at least one lawsuit against CSW, initiated by COPA, but afaik the topic there is only the copyright on the Bitcoin whitepaper.Maybe more will come after that one is won (and the legal costs recovered).

Topic: Safe to use bitcoin2cc? (requires sending them funds via mybitcoin.com)
### Original post:
I want to buy a virtual CC from bitcoin2cc.com. Anyone have experience using this service? I haven't seen any negative reports in this forum about them. I clicked the link to purchase one of the virtual CC's and it takes you to a page on mybitcoin.com where it asks you to send the bitcoins. This seems fine but there is a thread on this forum with people complaining that mybitcoin.com is a scam. From what I can tell these people lost their passwords and that is the reason they can't access their funds on mybitcoin.com, is that correct? I wouldn't be creating an account with them, just using them to send the bitcoins to bitcoin2cc. Is this safe? Are both of these sites legit?

### Reply 1:
For virtual cc, I have used <truncated> got prompt email regarding the card information.

### Reply 2:
Card worked just fine for a purchase with a different online retailer. I think the first retailer i tried had some weird billing service that wasn't based in the US.

Topic: Is there really a limited supply of bitcoins?
### Original post:
I know that there will only ever exist 21 million bitcoins, and I trust that there is reliable algorithms in place to ensure that there will never be any more.However, say that I take the source for bitcoin and start up a new genesis block and call this bitcoin2 and get some people starting to use that as well. And then someone else starts up bitcoin3 and so on to infinity. Then we have an unlimited supply of limited supplies. Any reason that this would not happen if bitcoin really become a household name?I really like the idea of bitcoin and I'm trying to spread the word as much as I can. A friend of mine who is knowledgeable in economics brought up the argument above and I didn't know what to answer really...

### Reply 1:
So you are saying that the reason Bitcoin would work and not Bitcoin1,2,3 is that Bitcoin has more credibility and is more widely accepted? Well, if that is the only thing it relies on then that is not much actually, because Bitcoin has no demand, no ventors, etc, compared to gold or traditional currencies. What is Bitcoin then more than a Ponzi scheme?

### Reply 2:
One thing (probably the only thing) that limits competition at this point is that Bitcoin is very small in a very large market. There are huge threats arrayed against it. It is more profitable to cooperate rather than to compete.

Topic: It's the PROTOCOL that matters.. Nothing else..
### Original post:
Well, these certainly are 'interesting' times in the Bitcoin sphere.. (They always are to be fair.. )In my humble opinion, the current 'Situation' stems from the fact that the protocol is NOT FINISHED. This is the issue. Not the client software, as that is simply an implementation of the protocol.We should WANT lots of implementations of the protocol. Trying to use just ONE client, CORE or whatever, is not a good idea. Imagine if we all had to use the same web browser ? That would be rubbish.Imagine if the Core HTTP protocol could change.. What a nightmare.. All the browsers/servers in the world having to argue and fight over who is right, and who is dead.. Well that's the situation we currently find ourselves in.What this needs, is to finally and concretely define the Bitcoin protocol. No more Hard-BIPS. No more protocol level changes. One more MEGA-FORK, and then we live with what we have created. Full stop.Tried to work out what future forks might occur here.. <link> the 'Protocol' is specified, done and dusted, then, and ONLY then, will this uncertainty about the future disappear. Otherwise we are all just waiting around for the next change.. and round and round the merry-go-ro<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
i'd love to see the bitcoin protocol to be fixated and with good documantation.but i dont think this will ever happen - even http changes btw....IMHO if we fixate bitcoin protocol in the long run this would hinder mass adoption. because if new requirements arise they cant be included and may force(!) users to altcoins. normal users wont accept a currency who they need to worry if its the right one or they have to constantly check if there is a need to move.one solution may be sidechains. but i'd like to see them in practice before i can make some conclusions (afaik they need ugly addresses; but i hope there is a solution for that problem)

### Reply 2:
Have to agree with your point of view.The client software is getting there in leaps and bounds with more being released on an almost daily basis and they are also getting less complicated to use making bitcoin much more accessible to all. However, they all depend on the protocol and if that is 'not working' then essentially nothing works.There is, in my opinion, a very large risk from the side of the banks who are all starting to seriously look at the protocol/blockchain and some are even nearing the <truncated> phases. I see this as a risk as the majority of people will favour a crypto like service delivered by their banks instead of making use of bitcoin especially with everything that is going on with bitcoin at this stage. We know that a 'bank coin' will never be the same thing but for the masses it will look like the better option.

If they made a example of Ross, they should make an example of this agent too, but we all know lady justice in the USA is blind. Her eyes are covered so that she cannot see the corruption and injustice going on in the American Judicial system. The agends are there to guard against crime, and then they steal money... How can a plea justify anything? The thing is, they knew all about this when Ross was on trial, and they did not want to accept it in court. There are no double standards in true justice.

Since no-one owns BitCoin as such, who are they going to put in prison?The worst they could do is outlaw it in the US I guess, but if it then takes off in other countries, it's going to be kind of hard to stop it. Even in the US people would probably VPN into another country to continue transacting.I guess it would hurt the overall BitCoin economy however.

### Reply 1:
All those models were somewhat amusing to me, but today they are not even that anymore, and not only because they turned out to be wrong, but because over time one simply gets tired of all these speculations. Even without any model, every optimist expects that BTC price will overtake the next ATH after the next halving, but all the numbers are nothing more than mere speculation.Some may agree that $170k is a nice number, but to me it somehow seems modest, because many expect much more from Bitcoin in the next 4+ years.

### Reply 2:
Yeah, and we should already learn from the first modelling that we have, predicting the price is very difficult and as much as we factor everything we can think of to come up with another model, improved version of the first one, it is till going to be a hit or miss.And I think we don't have complicate things, perhaps conservative prediction will be last all time high of $69,000 by 2.x.

Topic: How to buy food with bitcoin??
### Original post:
My debt card number was stolen by Target about a week ago. I have been forced to live off of Bitcoin but it's hard to find food. So far I have been mostly using egifter.com to 'gift' myself USD paper credit cards bought with bitcoins. The selections are kinda dismal though. Kmart lunch meat and pizza are not things I enjoying eating for 100% of my meals. Also, getting gas for my car has been a huge challenge. Anyone have some bitcoin survival tips?

### Reply 1:
You might be able to find someone to cash you out at localbitcoins.com.

### Reply 2:
Where do you live? I'm excellent at cooking. If you're around tarpon springs I'll make you a couple of meals with a nice cheap rate.

That means I want to create 50 public/private key pairs and fund each one with exactly 1 whole btc. Here is the thing. I want to fund them with newly minted coins but i am not a miner. The coins need to be intact, as in i don't want to have 1btc that is coming from 2 or more addresses to create the 1btc.Thoughts?

If your willing to accept generation address -> your address -> 50 addressesi'm sure any plenty of pool ops will take 55 btc in exchange for 50.

Topic: Update on my hardware store which accepts Bitcoin
### Original post:
Hello all. It has been a while since I made a topic regarding my hardware store which has started accepting Bitcoin as a payment in September of 2021. It has now been 6 months and the business is going very well, but sadly not a lot of people decide to pay using Bitcoin. I often get people saying things like: ""Isn't Bitcoin a huge scam or something?"" or ""Couldn't Bitcoin just drop to 1 cent?""...It's sad to see that people still have those stupid stereotypes about Bitcoin. This honesty sucks because it gives a negative reputation to Bitcoin and my business.However, I have made sure to inform people who used BTC to make a purchase about the BitcoinTalk Forum and how it is a good place to learn and read on the topic of cryptocurrencies in general.

### Reply 1:
Such kind of statement tells you that there are lots of people still doesn't know what is bitcoin. Anyone who says bitcoin is a scam is mostly oldies, or victims of fake news, just tell them paypal accepts bitcoin you know, so paypal is scam also?. And that 1 cent, lmao, ldk if its a joke or sarcasm, or just pure stupidity.

### Reply 2:
If they think bitcoin is a scam, how about our journey, which has long recognized bitcoin, even now, there is no evidence that we were cheated by bitcoin or bitcoin took our money away.They think that digital money is all the same.If they have doubts about bitcoin, why would they want to join your business from the start?It's better for people like that to be given a clear understanding of the world of bitcoin, don't just comment without having proof.

### Original post:
Hi All,In association with Intersango Software (the guys that brought britcoin to the market). We are proud to announce Australia's first real Bitcoin Exchange, we are an Australian registered company based in the Gold Coast.In 3 days the site will launch live.We are giving Australian's the opportunity to paper trade, to get use to the exchange and how it works, when you sign up we will assign you AUD and BTC this is limited to 3 days only, you can not withdraw or deposit funds in the account until we go LIVE.This will help us test security, order book, trade, withdraw and deposit's, this will help make sure we have a uninterrupted service.Two factor Authentication is on the exchange for testing.Our company has been around for 3 years, our background is providing Financial products for High Net Worth Individuals based in Melbourne, we have recently relocated to Queensland as the majority of our customers are here. Id like to put this pre-introduction to the forum for discussion. you can find us at <link> or <link>

### Reply 1:
The volume is quite low. Perhaps, and this is only a suggestion, start off without charging any fees, once you have a larger customerbase that would be the time to introduce fees.Britcoin has been completely transparent with this in that it is waiting for accreditation or something before it can charge customers, and now the volume is high.Of course, the low volume may be due only to the fact that the exchange is incredibly young, of course.

Topic: I made a mistake. Is this your address?
### Original post:
<truncated> withdrew my money from BitMit (luckily it was only 1.2743 BTC) but I made that mistake I've been seeing people make. I was in a hurry and pulled an address from my address book rather than clicking receive coins. I have no idea what the address is. I made no contact with anybody during that time, whether through email or otherwise. It could possibly be a wallet that was on my phone, but I have no idea.

### Reply 1:
I know I should've labeled it, that's exactly what I said after I did it. The last transaction was a withdraw over a year ago, which makes me fairly confident that it was a phone wallet. But it was that app that I always had trouble with. Luckily, I saved the wallet file, so I'll try to see if I'm able to get it. But in any case, learn this lesson from me and don't do it yourself.

### Reply 2:
Another hint...On this transaction to the <truncated> there was one of the <truncated> which is the donation address from this hidden service: <link> The address is not present at the site now, but you can see it on a google search.<link>

Topic: BTC halving event - What can we expect?
### Original post:
As the BTC ETFs are now approved, the market is looking onto the next bullish catalyst for the crypto market known as the BTC halving event. The BTC halving event takes place every four years and cuts the rewards for Bitcoin mining in half. It has occurred three times so far in 2012, 2016 and 2020. The next halving event is on April 22nd, a month prior to possible ETH ETF approvals.Looking at past data reveals mixed patterns in BTC halving occurrences leading up to the event. Some data suggests market corrections preceding the halving, while other data points to market surges. However, a consistent trend emerges for all post-halving periods, showing that each of the three halving events initiated a bullish cycle in the crypto market on HTF. This indicates that any market correction around the BTC halving event is a generational investment opportunity from a a long-term perspective.The first BTC halving was followed by a 10300% rise of BTC over a period of 12 months.The second halving event was followed by a 3000% rise of BTC over a period of 18 months.The third halving event was followed by a 750% rise of BTC over a period of 18 months.After each halving event, the percentage move <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
I made a post earlier regarding Bitcoin Halving Events. It's going to happen in April of this year and the biggest expectation you can have is supply shock.Which will eventually make the price go up due to demand/supply ratio. It will take some months after the Halving event for the ratio to get equal atleast.

### Reply 2:
if you look at the 2011 ATH($30) and then 2012 halving. the 2012 halving year($13 high) did not exceed previous ATH($30)if you look at the 2013 ATH($1.2k) and then the recovery. the 2014 recovery bottom($110) did not go below the 2011 ATHif you look at the 2013 ATH($1.2k) and then 2016 halving. the 2016 halving year($960 high) did not exceed previous ATH($1.2k)if you look at the 2017 ATH($20k) and then the recovery. the 2018 recovery($3.7k) did not go below the 2013 ATH($1.2k)however the pattern started to breakif you look at the 2017 ATH($20k) and then 2020 halving. the 2020 halving year($28k high) did exceed previous ATH($20k)if you look at the 2021 ATH($70k) and then the recovery. the 2022 recovery did go below the 2017 ATH($20k)so it looks like since the ""futures"" whales jumped on board in recent years, with their spot bots, using a separate stash to control spot markets to ensure they get their future contract wins. they have changed the patterni originally in early 2020 envisioned 2024 to be a sub $70k limit(pattern of previous).. then a above $70k bottom in 2026but due to the disparity of pattern in 2020-21-22, we just cant tell what 2024-25-26 will bring

### Reply 1:
I would only add that each new halving has lower fundamental impact and higher speculative impact on price. Since the very first halving decreased inflation from 25% to 12%, second halving from 9% to 4,5%, third one decreased inflation from 3,8% to 1,9%. Fundamentals behind current halving were like 15 times lower comparing to first halving. Next halvings will stop to have any fundamental influence on price since decrease from 1% inflation to 0.5% inflation is like nothing. Both are close to dust.

Topic: How come there is no competitor to Bitcoin yet?
### Original post:
with improvements built into the system, from all the bad experiences of bitcoin.no one is doing such a thing?

### Reply 1:
We were waiting because we thought it was your turn to build a decentralized open source crypto currency. You gunna?

### Reply 2:
It's still there. There is absolutely nothing preventing anyone from making a newer and better Bitcoin. If it provides clear advantages to Bitcoin, I will switch, just as I choose to use Bitcoin because I see clear advantages to it over Paypal and the like. Dwolla is attempting to do the same, so all the power to them.This ""version"" (so to speak) simply has the first-to-market advantage, which is becoming more and more important, though it's not an insurmountable obstacle.

### Original post:
The radicalness of this new government and their desires to fulfill the promise the people voted them in, they must follow through on that duty if they want to get re-elected, that is how the current government is viewing their win in this election. If this is the case, and they fulfill their goals, this will be a major radical shift in the types of governments winning power. (The democrat/republican will become a thing of the past oh so I hope) So keep that in mind with all that is happening in the world. The world is mutating and changing like an organism metamorphosing very rapidly. So these fringe elements are really beginning to make their way into the center of mainstream society/dialog. Once more capital controls get put into place, and economies crater, government get more hostile, there will be a an entire revolt. Should the Euro drop Greek funding, let the banks go completely insolvent. Here is a chance for bitcoin to and the families and business in Greece to utilize the block chain in the same way of the early days of the United state, and much of the world for that matter.

Im extremely interested in the outcome of Greece, i'll listen to this later. But in any case I dont see them making Bitcoin the official Greece coin so to speak. People is too dumb to adapt all of a sudden to Bitcoin. Its too crazy and experimental to make it the currency of an entire nation.Then again they are in a dead end on the 28th, unless they arrive at agreement with Merkel which is not gonna happen.

### Reply 2:
Varoufakis donest believe in Bitcoin as a replacement of national fiat currencies at all, and I dont think nothing can change his views on this so I dont see it OP.

Topic: Japanese financial regulator considers imposing stricter crypto rules
### Original post:
Japan's financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), has begun debating stricter regulations for cryptocurrencies in an effort to better protect Japanese investors.In July, the FSA set up a dedicated department as well as a panel of financial experts to assist the government in overseeing digital, decentralized finance. According to the Jiji Press, the agency will also be responsible for tracking developments related to cryptocurrencies and the Central Bank (CBDC) digital currency initiatives.The financial regulator intends to replace and enforce new cryptocurrency regulations by mid-2022. With these new regulations, the FSA hopes to stabilize the digital currency market while not harming development and innovation in the ecosystem.The FSA revised a similar law in 2019 that effectively forced cryptocurrencies in Japan to implement new features to protect users' assets. The decision was linked to the hacking of Bitpoint, a $ 32 million loss-making cryptocurrency exchange in Japan.In addition to the recent hacking of the Liquid cryptocurrency exchange, the FSA believes that domestic operators have not yet taken sufficient action to combat money laundering and price <trun<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Based on the case that occurred in Japan, it shows that the government's seriousness in supporting crypto is quite good, although users must share transaction data in order to monitor suspicious activity, which results in losses so that they do not happen again.In my opinion, as a form of government attention to control all transaction activities to be more secure, then we will support this policy.

### Reply 2:
This policy should be supported because this is for the protection of the consumers and the safety and security of the country against terrorism. But this comes with a price which many cryptocurrency users would find hard to accept. I don't know if both of you would support this stricter rules on cryptocurrency even if it means mandatory KYC or even the submission of personal data of users from exchanges to government agencies.

Topic: Physical Bitcoins
### Original post:
Hi all,One of the biggest concerns facing bitcoin right now is becoming user-friendly. While spending bitcoins from your smartphone certainly seems cool, they're still not so universal as to replace existing concepts or technologies like physical money or credit cards.I know that there are ""bitbills"" floating around out there which use QR codes to hold the public/private keys but I was wondering if anyone had any input on a few of my more recent ideas.Does anyone think there is a legitimate use for actual bit*coins*? It would be just as easy to print a QR code for the public key on one side of a coin-like object which is hollow and made of something just strong enough to hold up inside of a pocket. It could be snapped in half to retrieve the private key if one wanted to convert it to digital bitcoins. It would have an advantage of small size and portability over bitbills. We could also store the public key in an RFID module to allow confirmation of balance that doesn't degrade if something as fragile as a paper QR code becomes damaged.Another, possibly much easier option would be to use small low-capacity flash drives to hold something like an individual wallet.dat file. With the r<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Actually, Bitcoins are every bit as universal as credit cards. Both require network access.I wouldn't do it with a credit card, I'd do it with a smart card. That way you could encrypt the data on the card and use a point-of-sale terminal to type in a password to unlock it. That way, if the card is lost, you aren't automatically out all of your money. And the way it would actually work is that your smart card would contain some of your private keys (with access to reasonable amounts of your balance; not all of it). The card and/or terminal (I haven't worked out all the detailed technical aspects) would use the private key(s) on the card to sign a transaction, which the terminal would then send along to the Bitcoin network. So the terminal needs to be ""smart"", i.e. it is a node on the Bitcoin network or is in communication with a trusted node on the Bitcoin network (i.e. you could have 20 terminals in a supermarket, all of which use a single Bitcoin node running in the manager's office). But the card can be ""dumb"".

### Reply 2:
I might have just answered my own question. The QR code on a bitbill appears to be a v4 code, which holds alphanumeric data, 67-144 characters worth. The private key QR code looks to be even smaller, but even assuming they're both full-size v4 QR codes that accounts for 134-228 characters maximum. A standard magstripe card can hold 79 characters on track 1, 40 on track 2 and 107 on track 3 for a total of 226 characters. Unless bitbills are using every last byte of that 228 possible characters we should be able to fit the same data on a standard credit card.Of course I'd still like an official answer if one is available Edit: We could also encrypt the private key with a pin. It would look and feel like a standard debit card.

Topic: Question about the current situation in China
### Original post:
I see a lot of people who seem to be panicking over the Chinese government's recent announcement(s). Then I also see others saying it's no big deal and nothing to worry about or that it's a good thing.I'm guessing the reality lies somewhere in the middle.I do have a question though that's been on my mind the last couple days. What kind of impact do you think this will have on the expansion of companies in China choosing to accept bitcoin as a payment method. If financial institutions aren't allowed to get involved couldn't that make it harder for a lot of businesses to start using bitcoin, especially if they already have close ties to the government.Whether this recent news is good, bad, or somewhere in the middle should it not be of some concern that two large companies in China just backtracked and won't accept bitcoin now (Baidu and China Telecom). To me that alone doesn't seem like a good trend if you wan't bitcoin to expand to the point where everyday consumers can use it at most places. Any insight on why both Baidu and China Telecom have backed off after this recent announcement? I was pretty excited when I first heard China Telecom would let you buy smartphones with bitcoin<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
not sure if businesses allowed to barter there. here's my wild speculation:what Chinese gov did basically has sent a signal to their people: ""keep calm and keep acquiring"", they don't want this to get blown out proportion and out of their control too fast. first they move private money into bitcoin, then allow businesses to accept it, allow financial institutions get involved, then they dump USD reserves which would accommodate two very specific and important goals: a)unload their USD reserves without severe impact on global economy and their exports and by doing so b) make their early private money investors extremely wealthy and also c) establishing bitcoin as a reserve currency/commodity while being major holder, probably the largest. or maybe they are just concerned about money laundering effect and don't realise this huge potential, although i'm not sure how can't they, i mean dollar isn't getting stronger with every passing year.

There are many people in 2021 that have decided Bitcoin is the future - and they aren't wrong either!One question a lot of people are asking is whether your Bitcoin wallet can be hacked or not - well, can it? And is there a way to secure these funds? <link>

### Reply 1:
Remember to use the password of the BTC wallet only there. Dont utilize the same key in social networks, in e-mail and also dont write it in notes on your phone. Two-Factor authentication can help you.

### Reply 2:
Cold wallets are a more secure, long-term residence for your Bitcoin. Theyre also called hardware wallets because they often come in the form of a USB-drive-shaped device that can plug into your computer or link to your computer or phone via Bluetooth technology. Hot wallets, however, generally live online, which makes them more vulnerable to hackers.

Bitcoin needs limits. All Exchangers should have limits it means that there is some limits that btc cant go to Under those prices. 25% correction Will devastate many People Financially. So markets should have the limits how low the prices Can go then it Will Give some credibility and btc Can be taken seriously. For example: I bought btc one month ago so the limits Will assure that there is no lower prices what it was month ago in few days. So the limits Will be stopping btc to drop down fast so it Can fall down only some price level. Same thing should be with gold also until then there is no low price and no Higher price the price Can be anything the whales want Assets like this are not worthed nothing there is no Security the real Estate is much Better coz it cant fall down with one day 20%... It's a insane. We cant talk about value but just funny business. Markets need to be regulated Better ways and not just how the government Will do but Before They going to regulate and place the limit system They ask me otherwise it Will be chaos again becouse I see no any smart People in governments Banks or some kind of instution. To steal to manipulate to do funny business anyone Can do it<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Bitcoin is not created for this. Bitcoin is decentralized, and I believe the market and people decide the price of Bitcoin, based on the buyers and the sellers.There are a lot of differences between Bitcoin & other cryptocurrencies compare to stock markets. The only downsides here are the whales (those people who got lot of Bitcoins or any money) since for sure they can able somehow make some huge move in prices, especially we are still very low market cap these days.

### Reply 2:
Why exactly 25%? Why not 20% or 10%? Some people may have invested their entire savings, so 10% may be equally devastating to them.No, this is a free market. Governments can intervene in different fields, such as externalities, public goods and monopoly power.

### Original post:
Hi,before BTC will get accepted by ""normal"" humans (not only by the active community) we need names for BTC values which are smaller than 1 BTC. The most users don't like values with many zeros (e.g. 0,0005 BTC).My offer:1 BTC = BitCoin0,01 BTC = 1 cB or 1 cBTC (BitCoinCent)0,001 BTC = 1 mB or 1 mBTC <truncated> BTC = 1 B or 1 BTC (MicroBitCoin) The most characters can write with normal keyboard layout. This is importend because nobody would search for characters on his keybord.Than we can offer goods or micropayment with human readable values:e.g. Show this videos cost : 0,0001 BTC (not readable) or 100 B (readable)

### Reply 1:
they are nice, but it's not ""regular"". I would propose to use the -cent postfix for every SI power prefix of base 3:1 btc = 100 BTCc (""bitcent"")1 btc = 1,000 mBTC = 10,000 mBTCci.e.""millibit"" and ""millibitcent""1 mBTC = 1,000 BTC = 10,000 BTCci.e.""microbit"" and ""bicrobitcent""/aka Satoshi.and there is still room for nBTC and nBTCc (nano/nanocent)

### Reply 2:
Complicated.Just drop the bitcent altogether and you have ""regular"" scale. We don't need to use the same divisions as fiat currencies. milli bitcoins / millies is just fine. Then micro bitcoins / mikes or whatever.- My 20 millies.

Topic: How did Mr. Satoshi Nakamoto get inspiration about developing Bitcoins?
### Original post:
So I do think back in 2009 or way before 2009 something like apple fell on his head like Newton happened which made him think of an online Currency years ahead of it's time . What if the apple was the Morse Code ? The single most basic encrypted code which was invented back in 1837 could be the inspiration. Morse code uses bases Dots and Dash Making a normal signal encrypted , which can only be decoded by a special software or even a person who understands it . How a very simple thing could have helped discovered the Bitcoins , what are your thoughts ? Your take on what was the inspiration behind bitcoins??

### Reply 1:
I think that Satoshi got inspired by the earlier ""digital money"" consepts.According to Wikipredia:He might have been inspired by the Friedrich Hayek theory about ""competing money""(I don't remember the correct term).Friedrich Hayek wanted money to be out of the control of central banks,because central banks monetary policies were damaging the business cycle and creating inflation.The concept of a currency,that isn't controlled by any central bank or government in the world is the main idea of Bitcoin.That consept isn't invented by Satoshi itself.

### Reply 2:
It's completely up to him. Heck, he can even freely dump every single one of the coins he mined in the markets and it would be fine. Sure the price would most definitely crash which could be a bummer for a lot of people, but it's his money. He should do whatever he wants with it. Free markets.

Topic: Gold bugs ignoring bitcoin?
### Original post:
Perhaps they aren't ignoring bitcoin, maybe they are still learning about it.This future film seems to sway more towards the hard money side of things. <link> isn't to say that gold/silver are going to be worth nothing, but I tend to think that highlighting the utility of bitcoin is important in our technological age.Perhaps in a few years bitcoin will get some attention from say a Mike Maloney...i know James Turk is aware...

### Reply 1:
I guess that depends on your definition but I see a lot of ""gold bugs"" here or at least people who either still hold or have held a good amount of PM's as part of their portfolio. I think Bitcoin and gold overlap quite a bit in the sense that both types of investor have a similar outlook for the macroeconomy with regards to the reckless monetary policy being implemented by our various heads of government.

### Reply 2:
Goldbugs will learn to appreciate Bitcoin when they learn that they can use Bitcoin for sending gold.

Topic: If max bitcoins represented the global economy today
### Original post:
i know there is just slightly less than 21,000,000 bitcoins that can ever be issued, but since we don't have an exceedingly accurate number for the global economy equivalent, i'm just using 21m. so max number of bitcoins (21,000,000), divided by smallest unit of each bitcoin (.00000001) gives us the max bitcoin units (2.1 1015).wikipedia gives a 2010 est global economy of 74 trillion (USD equivalent), which we divide by the max number of the smallest unit of bitcoins to find the current value of the smallest unit of bitcoin today, if all bitcoins were in circulation and representing the full global <truncated> just under 4 cents per .00000001 bitcoin, or $3,523,809.52 USD per BTCwith currency markets and exchange offering fractions of a cent precision, is bitcoin capable of becoming a global currency? yes, i know it would be a good problem to have, but that really isn't much of an answer to a potential technical issue.disclaimer: i may have screwed the math up as i threw this together pretty quick. any necessary revisions are very welcome.

### Reply 1:
The fact is that Bitcoin can be changed to use more than 8 decimals. From this point of view it can support any economy imaginable. There are other issues Bitcoin would run into MUCH earlier though. The system doesn't currently scale well to a billion dollar economy, it is completely unusable for a trillion dollar economy. Even if the whole world used Bitcoin, there are other issues related to scaling that need work before we have to worry about the decimals.So far I haven't seen anything that can't be overcome though. Processing and verifying Bitcoin transactions will be more and more server-based in the future and I have a hard time believing that server processing power, bandwidth and disk space will be insufficient for Bitcoin, especially when we use compression methods to make it better. There are actually some compression enhancements coming to Bitcoin very soon.It's important to take into account that servers get better all the time. Disk space is cheaper, bandwidth is cheaper and faster, processors get faster etc. Overall it's very unlikely that Bitcoin can't be scaled to work, it'll just be a bit different than it is now. Once Bitcoin gets bigger we'll have more client-ser<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 2:
that undermines the whole idea of bitcoin. it adds centralization and lowers security.And if a pc will not able able to use the client because of the size of the blockchain, that could be an indication that the current system still has some improvements to be made. And i know these improvements will never be made because of the sheer amount of moaning and groaning people would do because all their fortunes would be useless. and what i am suggesting is checkpoint blocks(all coins associated with all accounts are listed out, so no previous blocks would be required. then when you need to reinstall the client, it would come with the most recent checkpoint block).Over all i have given up on bitcoin, development as essentially stopped, and there are no forks that implement any features beyond playing with block times and the max amount of coins possible. and if a newer and better implementation comes along, i don't want to be stuck with worthless bitcoins. Although it does work great for sending money through the internet .

This is great news indeed. Of course, this is very valuable news, and I really hope it will have a positive impact on Bitcoin in the future. Many large companies have become more active in supporting Bitcoin, and this is very cool. We can only hope for the development of the entire cryptocurrency world.

It's good to see that more and more corporations are realizing the worth of cryptocurrencies. Along with it, I have read two very positive news about cryptos today. 1. IMF released a video on 24 August on Twitter explaining what cryptocurrency is and the video talks about cryptos in a positive light. Tweet: <link> A software company called ""Snappa"" converted 40% of their cash reserves into bitcoin.Ref: <link> mean, these are super positive news about the cryptos in general. I hope those who have lost money back in 2017, will be able to recover their losses shortly!

Topic: Why not just make BitcoinXT a separate coin?
### Original post:
I'm wondering why it is necessary to take over the original bitcoin's blockchain over many months? What if XT proponents simply forked the blockchain right away instead and called it BitcoinXT? They could then try to get exchanges to carry it along with the original bitcoin. If at some point more and more people got fed up with fees and transactions on bitcoin core, people would vote with their money by slowly moving Bitcoin core funds into BitcoinXT and raising the price. If the larger block size became preferable merchants might start accepting BitcoinXT as well.I think bug fixes for bitcoin core at this time are understandable, but block size really isn't clearly a bug, but more like a limitation. Also there is the matter of time; this isn't a change they are trying to institute on a newly launched technology. Bitcoin has been around for many years now and I'm starting to think this could be a dangerous precedent.So what's so bad about just launching a separate coin called BitcoinXT?

### Reply 1:
Because XT proponents don't want to split the ecosystem in 2 as most of the Core proponents either. There is an economic incentive to try to reach consensus among all market participants.

### Reply 2:
We have not even reached the level where bigger blocks even matter right? That's what I dont even understand. People are causing all this controversy and splitting the community up along a dotted line over something that is not even a problem yet.

I doubt if they could even buy 50%. The accumulation would be/ is gradual and will slow as the price gets more expensive. But they will accumulate none the less as with everything else ..gold..treasury bonds..copper etc.

### Reply 2:
Without ability to be backstopped by potentially infinite supply creation, 1% reserve ratios will not be tolerated. Forgive me for not providing references, but I think the data points to about 10% being the limit of what humans will tolerate when there's no infinite insurance backing up a balance sheet.Essentially, at higher than 10-to-1 leverage, humans get a bit uneasy and will likely cause a ""run"" on a bank.

Topic: Bitcoin used by Criminals to sophisticate their footprints
### Original post:
I am an advocate for Bitcoin and It pleases me to tell people about Bitcoin. But there are issues we need to attend to. Bitcoin was created as a means of payment, and some people are using it for that purpose. Unfortunately, this includes criminals. The rate at which criminals use Bitcoins to enhance their operation and make their footsteps sophisticated is just increasing! Haven't you heard that ""Bitcoin is a scam""? This phrase only comes up because people have been seeing Bitcoin used for such purposes. Bitcoin is available to everyone, so how can we stop/reduce the misuse of cryptocurrency? Considering that KYC is not involved because I and some people prefer being discreet about our identity. So, how can we stop this, and I'd still have my secrecy? This is already rubbing dirt on us and needs to be attended to.

### Reply 1:
Nope. People aren't calling bitcoin a scam just because criminals could use it. People mostly call bitcoin a scam because they don't understand it, without them being able to conceptualize a non-physical asset being worth something.Pretty much nothing as Bitcoin is free to use for literally everyone. The same way how criminals are also able to use cash for criminal purposes. It's literally the downside of every single technology it will always be usable for nefarious purposes.

### Reply 2:
Yea, I meant to say 'sometimes'. But guys, we all know that fiat is used for illegal activities too. However, that of Bitcoin is rapidly increasing as it offers criminals a better position. If you deposit a huge amount of money in your bank account, the financial agency may investigate on how the money was made. But if you own 2000 bitcoin, no one knows who you are to question you. For this and some other reasons, Bitcoin is preferred for their criminal activities.

Topic: Bitcoin at the US Senate
### Original post:
On the 18th November, which is a bit over a week from now, members of the Bitcoin community will be testifying in front of the US Senate in two committee hearings:1) Senate Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs (HSGAC) committee2) Senate Banking committeeThe hearings have been called so US representatives can learn about Bitcoin and in particular, about its impact on law enforcement and banking. The HSGAC hearing will have two panels. The first one consists of members of US LE agencies. The second is the industry panel and will have, amongst other people, Patrick Murck of the Bitcoin Foundation on it. For those who don't know Patrick, he is pretty much ""the Bitcoin lawyer"" and is one of us - he has been involved behind the scenes with Bitcoin for a long time now, I talk with him frequently and I know he will do a great job. That said, Patrick was not our first choice. Actually the Senate invitation was for Jon Matonis, who was our first choice. Unfortunately Jon couldn't make it on such short notice. Gavin would have been our second choice, but he is in Australia visiting family at the moment and also was not available.The selection of the other panelists are also, I think, good<rest of post truncated>

Obviously there isn't a need. But trying to spread understanding and such can't be seen as a bad thing, right?

Topic: Trust in cryptocurrency?
### Original post:
Recently, I've been wondering, and based on the people I live with, I'd say that only 20% of them know what cryptocurrency is.Sometimes I ask my friend or colleague if he knows what Bitcoin is, and if they're young (20-35 years old), they say, ""Yes, I've heard about it. But I don't know much about it.""If I'm talking to older people (4060), mostly they don't know what it is.We are living in a world of big changes in every aspect of life. But do you think it will be time when cryptocurrency will come into our lives and be normal for all people? Will people be able to trust crypto?I'm wondering what your opinion is about this.

### Reply 1:
I hate to see where the current system is going. I live in Europe, and here the government wants to cancel all paper money and force us to pay with our credit cards.People don't even see where it leads. Total control through the people who are in charge. No privacy.I say no to this. I don't agree with that.Putting aside the fact that the government already takes a huge amount of our money in taxes, I don't want them to take away our privacy or the way we want to spend our money.This is why I see a lot of opportunities in cryptocurrency.

### Reply 2:
I live in country here older people are not very educated to understand crypto, they like that old ideas of making money like small business, employment etc, they only want to earn money, they don't want to understand bitcoin.nowadays this generation and further generation will be educated, they can take interest in technology, and after some year they will understand it they use it in regular transaction to buy things etc.and people who know what is crypto how it work how secure it is they will definitely need to trust.sorry for bad english

In this regard, Bitcoin is the good one while fiat is the bad one, and due to some reasons, the bad money might drive out the good money (Bitcoin). I also get the point that the good money (Bitcoin) can oust the bad money which makes it to be like a competition between the government and freedom in relation to centralized and decentralized money holding and usage.I want to be more specific on Bitcoin, it was not created to oust fiat, it was create to give freedom and privacy which is just an alternative to centralized money. If the true design of Bitcoin can make fiat go to an extinction, the government can regulate it, most people nowadays do not even care about privacy while they prefer the use of custodial means to use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies (although, I am not recommending that). Bitcoin does not totally fall into this category as a money that will disappeared, but it fall into the category of good money. Some countries especially the Western countries see the good reason to allow citizens to use this Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, while the governments are trying to regulate it. Bitcoin is not even showing any sign of extinction because the governments of the <rest of post truncated>

I haven't thought much about this situation, but an interesting thing is happening.The more Bitcoin gains popularity, the more people will keep Bitcoin as a store of value, because the amount of Bitcoin is limited.Therefore, the number of coins on the market will decrease.

### Original post:
(@Moderators I didn't wanna post this in the Technical sub-forum because I wanted as much help/visibility as possible - not only for tech enthusiasts. But do feel free to move to other subforum)About two weeks ago I posted a proposal on Apple's (quite new) Github repo Swift-Crypto about adding SECG Elliptic Curves, especially secp256k1 a.k.a. the Bitcoin curve.Three days later one of the core contributors and Apple employees shut down my proposal (scroll down in the thread on Github for his reply). I tried to be strategic when I wrote my proposal, to not focus too much on any specific DLT, why I did not call the proposal e.g. ""Add the Bitcoin curve"". However, I did mention Ethereum with name, that is not because I love Ethereum and hate Bitcoin - far from it. The reason why I mentioned Ethereum with name was that I was building up my argument, or my approximation really, where I claimed that 95% of all cryptos rely on the curve secp256k1. Not knowing how much the contributors of swift-crypto knows about the crypto sphere, I quickly needed to mention many coins are ERC20 tokens, thus using secp256k1.Anyway, my proposal has been rejected... Which kinds of sucks. So I was hoping bitco<rest of post truncated>

they already have a good reply with understandable reasons and let me give you yet another reason with a different perspective. you must not even want to use a cryptography library for any cryptocurrency unless you want to open yourself to a lot of attack surface!all these crypto libraries including ""swift-crypto"" are defined to do cryptography for general purpose, but the cryptography used in bitcoin (and by all its copies like ethereum,...) is special purpose. for example look at Open SSL which is the most popular crypto library. it was used in bitcoin core and was the source of a lot of bugs in bitcoin none of which even matter in general use like SSL encryption in your browser with <truncated> at BIP62 for a bunch of these issues!

Topic: Portal launches demo for atomic swaps for ordinal inscriptions
### Original post:
Hi, guys!I've been aware of Portal for about 2 years now: they're building a way to do cross-chain atomic swaps on layer 2s to increase liquidity on the Lightning network and also build a trustless way to do decentralized exchanges. But more recently, they've slightly shifted focus to also include ordinal inscriptions on Bitcoin's base layer. Basically, you can buy ordinals using the Lightning network (which automatically includes holders of USDT, WBTC or ETH on other chains).In the near future, I can see this as being a user-friendly way to build digital collectible markets on Bitcoin. Something like OpenSea, but much more elegant in its design and denominated in BTC.I thought it was an interesting concept, so I wrote an article about it. Hope some of you will find it useful <link>

### Reply 1:
None of us will get hurt! The problem was high transaction fees as most shitcoin traders were manipulating the fees. The miners supported them and If you want to blame anyone then blame those who updated the blockchain with taproot & miners. The issue of high fees to an extent has been resolved as it was a few weeks prior. In the coming times, the hype will dry down and we will get back to what we were experiencing earlier. With ordinals, we are still part of financial freedom, you might need to rethink your ideology of Bitcoin.

### Reply 2:
I'm not against ordinals per se but I don't like the effect they're causing on the Bitcoin network. If you'll find a way to migrate them completely to LN and stay there, that would be great!

Topic: Bitcoin cannot be decentralized if the Internet is centralized
### Original post:
Satoshi's invention of a revolutionary form of money that would give people control over their funds back in 2009 (Bitcoin), turned out to be a success. While the cryptocurrency's PoW consensus is partially centralized (mostly dominated by the Chinese), it has a wide distribution of nodes all across the globe. Theoretically speaking, Bitcoin is decentralized where anyone can set up a node to support the Blockchain. With enough capital, it's possible to secure Bitcoin in our homes with sophisticated ASIC machines too.So far, many people believe that Bitcoin is truly decentralized as ""no one"" controls it. But the harsh reality is that every single cryptocurrency and Blockchain network depends on the Internet to survive. It's no secret that in today's world, big companies like Google, Facebook, and even Amazon control the Internet. On the other hand, ISPs (Internet Service Providers) have a final say over what people can view or host using the Internet. This means that Internet is centralized, greatly defeating the purpose of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies of eliminating the middleman.For Bitcoin to be truly decentralized, the Internet needs to be decentralized first. Once that's <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
The internet is decentralized. It is literally millions of computers all around the world, no central point of failure. Google, Amazon and Facebook do not control the internet, if that is the extent of your internet usage, I feel sorry that you are missing out on so much more. If those companies were gone tomorrow, the internet would be just fine.Bitcoin is decentralized, with many nodes holding a copy of the blockchain, no central point of failure.By your logic, you may as well call it centralized since it only available in one galaxy, so if you can spread to more galaxies, then it will be more decentralized lol.

### Reply 2:
Can you elaborate? As I know, the Internet network is still largely decentralized, and thanks to tools like encryption, ToR, VPN, proxies it's impossible to control users. It's impossible to make a ""turn Bitcoin off"" button, so I wouldn't worry about it. There are problems with lack of competition between Internet service providers in some places, but it doesn't have any strong implications for Bitcoin.

Topic: Coin generation participation survey
### Original post:
It is common to hear people explain to newcomers to bitcoin that ""its not about the coin generation or getting free money, its about creating a medium of exchange"". I am interested in what the current ratio of generators to non-generators in the community is. Obviously this is an extremely NON-scientific method of examining that. So:1) Have you been using bitcoin for more than two months?2) Are you currently attempting to generate coins?3) If not currently generating, have you attempted in the past? If generating, how long have you been generating?4) Have you ever succeeded in generating a block? Many blocks?5) Why or why not do you generate? Purely profit-oriented comparison of cost of generation with market value in another currency? Just for fun? As a selfless contribution to the mathematical strength of the proof of work?Feel free to answer as much or as little as you like and I'm also interested in anything else relevant you would care to add. I will reply to my own post as the first answer.

It has always been this way, isn't it? With bitcoin having one of the best risk/reward ratios among the cryptocurrencies. I'm really not against speculating with other cryptocurrencies assuming you know what you're doing (most people don't), but bitcoin is the right pick if you just want to leave it there and be able to sleep comfortably at night.

I am also in the position of a long-term investor, so in the end, I dropped my choice for trust to invest long-term only in bitcoin. but my position as a day trader is still trading altcoins. not to hold but just to find the price difference and profit from it within 1 day timeframe. because I dare not hold altcoins for long term. maybe sometimes only for the medium term or a few weeks. but for the long term I only trust to hold bitcoin.

Topic: The Missing Ink MMORPG - Now Accepting Bitcoin
### Original post:
I represent UK games developer RedBedlam. I wanted to announce that we are now accepting Bitcoin for our MMO game, The Missing Ink - <truncated> believe we are the first MMO developer to move into bitcoin and certainly one of the first UK game developers to start accepting it.We strongly believe in Bitcoin and wish to support the currency in all our future games. Furthermore the current Bitcoin offer for in-game credits in The Missing Ink is the best value offer for buying in-game credits that we provide.For the gamers among you we have a competition running for all aspiring level/game designers to design the first raid zone in The Missing Ink, more details here - <truncated> also have a Kickstarter campaign running to provide funds to help us port The Missing Ink to iPad later this year. This will make The Missing Ink the first truly cross-platform MMORPG, whereby players of the PC/Mac/Browser versions will connect to the same game world as iPad and Android tablet players! Kickstarter campaign page is here --> <link> all players that buy credits using Bitcoin up until May 1st 2013 will be entered into a draw to win a custom avatar designed by our in-house artists - they are very c<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 2:
Thanks for that, what a cool game. I did some searching around for other UK game developers accepting Bitcoin and couldn't find much information out there. I did suspect we wouldn't be the first, so thanks for letting me know.And thanks also for the welcome!

Topic: First snapshot of bitcoin.org website
### Original post:
I wanted to see what kind of website Satoshi put together for Bitcoin, so I search the Wayback Machine and got this:<link> kind of interesting reading Satoshi's own words about how bitcoins worked.If you stumbled across this website in January of 2009, would you run this program created by this random dude named Satoshi?

### Reply 1:
I did stumble across the website in early 2009. I was looking to see if there was any form of digital cash available which was similar to what had been discussed on the Cypherpunks mailing list years ago. However, Bitcoin seemed too new and didn't seem like a workable option because nobody used it. I ended up ignoring it and going with Pecunix instead for the particular project I was working on. It wasn't until over a year later that I came across the site again and took a serious interest in Bitcoin. It would have been nice to have been mining all that time.

Topic: long term investment value?
### Original post:
BTC is extremely likely to not get destroyed or go away as a whole so it's a pretty respectable investment at the moment. It looks kinda sad value-wise lately and had apparently bottomed out quite a while ago but then came back. But I'm not thinking short term. I mean people buy up newspaper articles and sealed boxed toys and stuff and sit on them for 30-50 years and suddenly they're worth 10,000x more. People even buy up early release items in MMORPGs on purpose then sell them years later, though that's a lot less legal to try and turn into USD lol. So buying things for a low price and sitting on them for decades is sometimes a good idea. What about BTC?So how good of a long term investment in BTC be and how long term are we talking? I know like 75 years from now they're gonna be awfully scarce and practically only available from other owners cuz new blocks are gonna be darn hard to find. But how about like 2-5 years down the road?I would think that sometime pretty soon, the number of people mining vs the profits will collide into a massive explosion of hash values KABOOM! lol. And then nobody's going to start mining cuz the hardware + power compared to BTC conversion ratio will d<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
OP- you put waaaay to much emphasis on miners and their ability to affect price. Mining will become an increasingly small and specialized subset of the bitcoin economy. Bitcoin's value as an investment will depend purely on it's long term usefulness in trade.

### Reply 2:
Bitcoin is a high risk investment at the moment. Don't put money in that you can't afford to lose.Most of us here buy and hold bitcoin because we like the idea.

Topic: Idea for physical BTC bills
### Original post:
Before you read below, let me tell you that this is not my area of expertise & I don't know much about the technical aspects of BTC. I'm more interested in the economic side. But, I was doing some research on bills & couldn't find anything interesting. If this has technical issues or if I'm wrong in a newbie way, you where adviced. Or even worse, maybe this has already being created & im just repeating. I don't know.Ok so, after thinking for a while, I had an idea in which everyone, specially people who know absolutely nothing about BTC can hold it physically as a bill. And transact it without verifying the funds. At the same time, if the user wants to transform this physical BTC into digital form he also is able to do so. So how those this logic work?The only way to do this, is by hidding the private key inside the bill in such a way that you must destroy the bill to get digital acces to the funds. Otherwise it can continue circulating physically as a valid store of value & as a medium of exchange.This piece of paper would show only two things:1) A QR to verify founds.2) The value of the bill in sats or btc.In case someone has bad intentions & wants to repair the bill, so he can c<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
I am not sure whether this idea is really good or not. But it seems to me it is a step backward to be honest. Just when the world is doing away with notes and physical versions of fiat currencies, you have here pushing it forward as if it is the better way to use something which is the perfect currency to match a digital future. We have started to enter into a cashless society.

### Reply 2:
Cash is really good. It gives freedom. You don't need technology or wifi acces to validate.I live in the farm & the majority don't use technology or credit cards. They only use cash. Is easy and practical.The cool thing about this idea, is that the paper is the settlement. It can't be printed at the will of a government or a centralized institution. It would have the same atributes, but allowing people to transact it as physical cash.It doesn't need an institution to validate it. You can validate it by scanning the QR or getting the private key by destroying the bill. There are no third parties involved.The only problem here is how to create the trust mechanism to manufacture it. So people are confident that the QR code displayed in the bill is the one associated with the private key inside the bill.

Topic: How do we stop the division in the Bitcoin community?
### Original post:
Julius Caesar said, ""Divida et Impera"" - Divide and rule and since he divided Rome, no one ever contradicted him. We see some forces, trying to do the same. Divide and conquer may refer to: Divide and rule, in politics, sociology and economics, a strategy to gain or maintain power. Since the introduction of XT and Classic, we have seen some clear indications that people are trying to implement that strategy. There is nothing wrong with the submission of a opposing implementation to Bitcoin Core, because it is in the best interest of the technology to make suggestions and to develop new ideas to improve the technology. The problem come in, when submissions are done to accomplish other goals, for example a power grab or to Divide and conquerHow can the community come back together and fight for one goal? < Making Bitcoin the center of attention > It is not healthy for everyone to attack each other on public platforms and debate should be centered on making Bitcoin better.

### Reply 1:
I think the answer is here. People propose what they think it's best for the Bitcoin community and the community choses what works best and everyone merges under the same set of rules. After settling on a new set of rules, we have no division anymore.

### Reply 2:
Mike Hearn has moved on to the third party in this battle. His partnership with the banks, after he divided the community with his failed XT implementation was proof of this strategy. You have to read between the lines and see the bigger picture of how this was done. The biggest competition for Bitcoin < Core and Classic > will come from Private Blockchain technology that are being developed as we speak. ^hmmmm^

Topic: XT as Incentive for Bitcoin Core Nodes
### Original post:
I used to run two Bitcoin Core nodes back in the day. Being as it was, I simply saw no real incentive for me to continue to do so. My incentive used to be using Armory as my wallet, for security purposes. As I became more infromed about Bitcoin and wallets, I found out about secure ways to use it without having to run a node.Bitcoin XT has changed this. Now, first things first. I'm all for bigger blocks, but not this way. Specially not perpetually increasing block-size every X amount of blocks. A one time block increase to maybe 4MB or 8MB would be OK for me, plus Lightning network, plus off-chain transactions, tree chains and other innovations which we probably can't yet foresee.Bitcoin XT has become the incentive I needed to start running Bitcoin Core Nodes again. I'm starting two new nodes today, and I'll be starting two more on the weekend when I go back home from work. I see this as the only way people can vote for whatever their choice is.I see XT as a terrible way of doing something that is needed. There clearly was no consensus prior release. Hearn and Andresen are trying to reach it by skipping discussion and what I see as a result from this is a very poorly informed audit<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
That's one of the best posts I've seen on the 'hottest topic' of the moment eduardo. Thanks for that . I run a Bitcoin Core node & I'm sticking to my guns at the moment. We do need an increase in the blocks size but I want to steer clear of XT. I don't trust Hearn and will not be touching his client unless it comes to a point when I have no other option. I wish the Core devs would come to a compromise soon so we can relax & all the panic that's arose from the current situation will evaporate

### Reply 2:
A central group of developers agreeing is not consensus. It doesn't matter whether core devs all agree or not because it isn't their sole decision. Anyone can release a client without prior approval because this is not a closed-source project. The network decides, not the developers. If you want a coin where the developers make all the decisions and the users have no choice, there are plenty of closed-source projects out there you might prefer. Please see the last paragraph of this post and my post here for further reasoning because I'm getting tired of repeating myself about this.If there's panic, it's only from those who don't understand how simple this really all is. Again, it doesn't matter if the core devs compromise or not because it's not their sole decision. They are not in charge. We do not need their permission. Running an alternative client doesn't give the developers of that client ""control"" of the network. Please try to understand this simple fact.

Yes. Getting paid in bitcoin would be great. If people can push freelance websites like Elance, Odesk and freelancer.com to pay in btc it could bring thousands even million more people in bitcoin world.

Topic: Bitcoin and it's 4 Year-Cycle
### Original post:
BTC and It's CyclesThis is an amazing chart I have saved for more than a year now, it predicted the 2022 Cycle Low correctly. It's made by someone else, I do not remember the user however I have it saved.I just wanted to share this as many people here do not believe in the 4-Year Bitcoin Cycle. Here's a live proof of that being executed every cycle.The next possible Cycle High is in August, 2025-November, 2025.

### Reply 1:
Bitcoin price once made an ATH at 20K in 2017 and then again in November 2021 Bitcoin made a new ATH again according to the circle indicating the possibility of Bitcoin's next ATH exactly four years later in 2025. But it is not granted. Bitcoin price has already pumped a lot so it is highly expected that Bitcoin will make ATH again very soon but how long it will take is not sure. But everyone would be better off if someone made a long term Bitcoin haul. At present it appears that the amount of holdings has increased significantly from Bitcoin trading. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the number of Bitcoin holders is 69.24%.<link>

### Reply 2:
4-year cycle is a rough saying because two bull runs can be shorter or longer than 4 years but I see no big difference for true holders.I say this point to help people who still think a next cycle will be exactly like pwst seasons, they might miss the bull run with very good entry. If history repeats, a new bull run will come like 6 months after halving but if history won't repeat itself this time.Like the bull run will start a few months sooner even before the halving. It only causes difference if people hesitate to buy and wait for halving to start buying.

Topic: Making a brain wallet ""cheat sheet""
### Original post:
To my understanding, using hashed string as a brain wallet carries with it the following risks:1. The passphrase might be forgotten.2. The passphrase might be randomly brute-forced by an attacker performing something like a dictionary attack on hashed strings.--2.5 There could be an unintentional collision with someone who happens to use the same passphrase.3. The passphrase might be <truncated> Some combination of 3 and 2. Part of the passphrase is stolen, and the rest is discovered through brute force.(1) is a big concern for me. I intend to keep some savings in bitcoin for a long time, and it's very likely that I will forget the key if it is too difficult to remember.My idea is to make a list of personal questions, and have the answers be my passphrase. I understand that because of (2) doing so is magnitudes less secure than using a randomly generated passphrase, but using a random phrase would make (1) likely. I wanted to have the key based on facts that will remain relatively significant to me throughout my life.The list will be semi-secret. I'm not going to show it in public, but I won't worry about keeping copies in several different places, online and offline.My thinking is<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
I would advise that at the very least some of your ""answers"" (assuming each one is a part of the pass phrase) should include numerical characters and also other characters (such as - $ @ &).The following might give you some ideas:Q. Birth date of someone important:A. 1779-03-14Q. Price paid for your first bitcoin:A. $5.55Q. An obvious equation:A. 1+1=10Q. Gave you a nudge:A. Q. Long live:A. Rock&RollQ.

You could use the GPS coordinates of somewhere memorable (eg where you had your first kiss)You will almost certainly forget the coordinates but can look them up, or actually go there again with a GPS sensor. You would need to remember the level of accuracy and map coordinate system for it to be repeatable. So the question might be:Where were you bitten by a dog when you were seven ? (lat, long in degrees to 0.01 degrees)

Topic: Would Bitcoin become The General Currency in the Future?
### Original post:
According to evolution of money, trade was first done with the barter system, then it evolved to commodity money using Gold and it's kind,then into metal coins then paper money, later transactions where done with plastic cards, before it's evolved into electronic money and now crypto currency.About years ago El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender and there are speculations that other countries would also adopt it in the nearest future now my question is, with bitcoin being the leading crypto currency is there a tendency that it would become the generally used currency worldwide?

### Reply 1:
I don't know how others view it, but I don't think it will ever be. No matter the amount of adoption that Bitcoin will gain, I don't think it will ever be enough for it to gain such acceptance. There will always be one or two governments that are against it and, as such, won't want to accept it as their international payment option. So I guess it's a big no. This is just like asking if Bitcoin is going to replace a country's world currency, which I recently elaborated on in a recent thread.

### Reply 2:
If you're asking if there's a chance then theoretically of course there is. It's just the question of will governments allow it to be a dominant currency of their respective countries.

Topic: I don't trust mybitcoin or the UABB, but how come so many trust it?
### Original post:
Disclosure, I am not aware of how well or bad mybitcoin is, this thread is a representation of how I currently see it and hopefully will get clarity along with others. Make no full judgement for or against mybitcoin based on this one post alone. Thank you. I see people refer to them as the only option sometimes.A lot of 'older' members use it.But I always see complaints from newer members and I believe there was a decent amount of security issues <link> <link> <link> <link> <link> .I could paste threads all day, but most have issues, then further down resolved, but looking closer not every issue is resolved, there is just the common issue of people having a smart ass reply and a conversation ends lol. Those links are just random choices, search on your own.So how does it keep getting hit on for being not really a 'Scam' I would think, but having as many issue as it does yet continues to be used by a lot of major sites and still gets talked about negatively by other users.I am trying to factor in, when things are good and everything is working, no one says anything. So I factor in that there will never be as many posts saying something is good than there is something is bad on almos<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
I see a lot of 'classic' members with their accounts fine. I would consider you part of that with Bitcoin Weekly. I don't see Bruce Wagner's account being messed up either. More or less ""unrecognized"" members using the service I see touting up with complaints. And from what I gather, it just seems like that, 'it could be a lot better'.. like that is site is constantly being updated I'm sure (as should all sites that deal daily with peoples' Bitcoin, there should be staff available 24 hours a day), but I guess that is one of the things that maybe made me create this thread. I still have interest in the site, but the threads I posted, many more, I just wonder if someone from the site itself would maybe want to take a day or two through the forums, resolve issues, close cases, etc. Seems like it would be a wise investment for themselves, and it would only take their time to just answer questions and be the last word in threads.

### Reply 2:
This is very good to know. I know programmers are not social by nature, and I'm sure whoever is running mybitcoin has enough flow of Bitcoin and cash where obtaining new clientele is not necessary. Maybe it is time for some of these companies to hire social media people for each team. Jared from Tradehill has to be my favorite example of that, that team knew what was up from day one and had someone on that and he does his job well. Mybitcoin needs a face or a representative for the amount of people and business' they service, it would really be in a lot of peoples best interests. Or not.

This is just a speculation base on the chart provided above. It shows the behavior of the Bitcoin price in relation with the Bitcoin flow from exchange to derivatives.These kinds of flows are associated with the market cycle, hence we can speculate:- Increasing flows from Coinbase to derivative exchanges, bull market.- Decreasing flows, bear markets.This will help us to understand whats the current stand of traders on the <truncated> here <link> for more crypto updates.

### Reply 1:
A bit of a fundamental summary of bitcoin in macro and micro terms in order to understand whether the market belongs to one of the market cycles (bear or bull):The chart above shows a section of coins older than 1 year (which have not been spent or sold for more than a year). This averaged statistic allows us to distinguish distribution zones (when 1+ coins are spent) and accumulation (when these coins are accumulated). The graph shows a clear pattern of cycles since 2017. At the moment of decline (from ATH in 2021) there is a steady accumulation of coins that are moving into the 1+ year age cohort, which suggests a steady accumulation trend (coin maturation).Chart of price changes depending on the trading sessions:you can see that the European session and the American one are <truncated> <link>

Topic: Need help moving ""Pre-Forked"" Bitcoin to a new address
### Original post:
Since I've joined the crypto revolution, I've been accumulating Bitcoin as a sort of retirement fund. My cold storage wallet has been intact for nearly 6 years now. Thanks to the ""fork craze"" of 2017, my money has quadrupled. Talk about crypto being better than banks. Now, I want to move my ""Pre-Forked"" Bitcoin funds to a new address. But I don't know how to do it without risking losing my funds from other blockchain networks. All I want to do is send my ""Pre-Forked"" Bitcoin to the new native SegWit (Bech32) cold storage wallet, while ""splitting"" forked coins into new addresses.Can you help me?

### Reply 1:
Ok. I can see this works for Bitcoin only. But what if I want to preserve my balance from other Bitcoin forks (Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, etc)? I have read somewhere that such forks use the same private key. I don't want the balance from other coins to move into the same wallet address. Instead, I'd prefer to split my BTC into a new Native SegWit address, while I send other coins to separate addresses. Is this possible?

### Reply 2:
Thanks for the tip. Which wallet do you recommend the most for Bitcoin transactions on mobile devices? I have an Android phone and want to do this with the most secure and/or trusted, reliable Bitcoin wallet. It should be a matter of sweeping the private key, and sending the funds to the new native SegWit address.And to be honest, I did not know about ""replay protection"". I've thought that sending coins through the original chain, will also reflect itself on other chains. Sort of like what happened with the Ethereum Classic hard fork in 2016. It's a relief that all forked chains live independently from the original Bitcoin blockchain. Else, I would've lost the opportunity of selling the other coins for free money.

The git tree only goes as far as 0.1.5 and sourceforge doesn't have the original release either, but bitcointrading has some historical archives: <link> If I recall correctly Satoshis original release email on the cryptography list does not have MD5 sums so there does not seem to be any way to actually confirm that this (or any other bitcoin-0.1.0.rar) is the original archive and not one with a wallet stealing trojan.

Topic: Bitcoin and Pokemon soon to merge
### Original post:
<link> article has been viewed by pokemon fanatics and they are waiting to see what are the new features it has to offer. While bitcoin users are excited to have a new app that can earn bitcoins. But this is not yet available, as the article said, it is just a concept, a question or probability. The question on how and when will it happen still left as a mystery as they are waiting for a hacker to link pokemon and bitcoins.

### Reply 1:
I have read that article and as far as my understanding goes the article was just a speculation or a ""what if ?"". It tries to merge pokemon and bitcoins and you may get tokens while playing. The idea was not out of hand since there are a lot of online app games that gives price to players by just playing it. Its not new in the online apps but what makes the story interesting is the popularity of pokemon go at this time.

### Reply 2:
pokemon GO just got the popularity instantly and have nothing to do with bitcoin,adding faucet or getting paid by playing seems just useless thing they don't want to do,and evne without it the game still being played by so many people,so i think these speculations just far to be realized

We all know how worked hard Satoshi Nakamoto made the blockchain, for the ease of all of us, should we not do anything for this?So the answer is yes, we too should do something.That's why I and some of my friends have decided that we will. We will build a small academy with only two or three rooms, where we will tell people about blockchain, without any fees.I want to know this from you, is this a good idea? Please tell me if this is not the right way.We can only invest two or three months for this Academy.Lessons:How blockchain works.How to send or receive.How to buy/sell cryptocurrencies ( Trading).What is the private Key.What is the difference between Coins and Tokens.What is ICO or IEO.

If you have a good enough knowledge you could probably convince a local community centre or school to accept you to do a public talk. I feel this is something you'd want to travel around with, it's much better than grounding yourself in one place and probably cheaper. You may also be able to do web conferences and seminars and get people to watch/or produce free content online on your own web site.

### Reply 2:
I think its good but I guess young children are too young for it. Maybe for the adults and especially to those illiterate people. Its good to see those uneducated and illiterate to improve themselves. These people needs much to know how the world evolve now. Well, its a complex work to do but in the spirit of helping others or reaching out, irs a good start to transform these people.

Topic: What is your thought about halving?
### Original post:
In theory, when supply is cut and demand remains, prices will rise. But what is your thought? Do you guys think it will go up

### Reply 1:
The market is driven by supply and demand. when you cut inflation by half that is a big hit to supply, also some miners will stop mining, therefore less sell pressure. However, each halving is by definition less than half as significant. going from 50% interest to 25% interest is a big difference. going from 0.05% interest to 0.025% makes no difference despite being the same halving. somehow halving are supposed to become twice as significant since the coin becomes twice as rare, which is crap. the first time it stops working its over and bitcoin will suffer greatly at the expense of altcoins.

### Reply 2:
Once the halvening happens the sell pressure will be theoretically cut in half logically as the mining rewards will be halvened and the breakeven price for mining operations will likely rise considerably. Think about this way - a market is composed by buyers and sellers. At any moment in time when there is an imbalance of buyers and sellers in the market the price moves - either upside when the bulls make money or downside, case in which the bears are the winners. Miners need to sell some or all their production to at least cover a part of their operation costs. Once the cashflow from mining can't cover those costs anymore the logical choice is to pull the plug on the gears and stop paying for electricity and associated costs to protect themselves. If they have a lot of financial power to cover their operation costs with cash they can save the mined BTC to sell at least at the breakeven price, thus withdrawing some sell pressure from the market. Or they can acquire more powerful gear and reduce the costs. Either way the halvening should have a fundamentally strong impact on the market even if it is not going to be seen from the get-go.

Topic: Not an article about Bitcoin: ""I accidentally sent £1,000 to the wrong account""
### Original post:
People complain that if bitcoins are mistakenly sent to the wrong address, the transaction can't be undone. It turns out that fiat has the same problem.

### Reply 1:
Banks will say its not our fault so you have to make a legal claim but there is a little chance with banking transactions but in cryptos its not possible because we can never get the identity of the person who received the crypto funds.Reversing a bank transaction after being spent is also not practical for smaller amount like few hundred dollars because we may have to spend more money than the actual money to get them to be reversed for all the expenses.

### Reply 2:
The difference between fiat and bitcoin is that fiat as an ecosystem has a lot of different players with a different set of rules on how they handle reverse/mistake in payment. I think it's quite unfair to say that 'fiat is like this everywhere', but at the same time this could happen.Crypto or a decentralized system like bitcoin is more 'punishing' because they give you so much freedom, which is why people should learn on how to deal with that responsibility before doing new stuff without understanding.

Topic: Bitcoin part of the elite, the illuminati, new world order?
### Original post:
Ok before I write this, I want people to understand I am not a believer, I am not a fantasist and I do not want to make direct links between bitcoins and the things I discuss.OK i read a lot around the illuminati, new world order and to some people 'all that shite'. I dont believe in it, however I do think there is a strong possibility of its existence. To me Ive read pretty heavily fact based evidence around 9/11, the financial crisis, earthquakes, and even the collapse of recent of arab and middle eastern states. To the objective viewer of such subjects many believe that 'they' created such issues so as to not only lead to a one world state (I give you IMF, NATO, and the like). It is also many peoples beliefs that they are attempting to milk all liquid cash out of the system that we call our financial world. Now with what limited evidence that I have read about the creator Satoshi, I believe that one day IF the bitcoin system collapses and that satoshi does not make himself present in one way or another, that this was all a ploy in order to scam hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars from you and me. We are firm believers in Bitcoins, we see logical sense in its creation<rest of post truncated>

Topic: Bitcoin a top player in Libertarian Government
### Original post:
According to Simple Wiki; Libertarianism is a kind of politics that says the government should have less control over people's lives. It depends on the idea of maximum liberty. Libertarians believe that it is usually better to give people more free choices. The top advocates of this kind of government are cryptoanarchist since 1988 after the manifesto was released by Timothy C. May the idea of Bitcoin was born. The goals of Crypto anarchists include all; with the help of Bitcoin, we utilize today Two persons said Tim; may exchange messages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the True Name, or legal identity, of the other. However, years have passed, today it's happening through the help of Bitcoin, what he said in the next lines of this Manifesto; ""These developments will alter completely the nature of government regulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the ability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of trust and reputation. "" became a threat to the Government and they are working strides ahead to stop Bitcoin. Though Bitcoin cannot get terminated without tampering with the laws of physics and ma<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Libertarianism is likely an ancient concept. I know one of the major parties in the UK was a libertarian one between 1700-1900 and I think the Roman empire started to adopt it as it was collapsing (or to enable expanding before it collapsed - like most empires have done since).One of the main problems I see with it is that most of the powers libertarian governments give up are ones businesses gain the most power from or harness to try to get more power - rather than the people. Reducing regulations greatly benefits businesses than individuals because they have to do less testing to adhere to the regulations and normally don't pass this onto their customers - because they paid a higher price before. Other things like minimum wage and workers rights become a lot easier to exploit too.

### Reply 2:
As with Bitcoin, it doesn't work in all cases. Much of my outlooks in life are probably associated with socialism, and obviously Wales has quite the history with socialist beliefs, with the National Health Service. However, I'm quite quick to accept that it doesn't work in every single situation, so much like Bitcoin it's not for everyone or every single situation you can think of. Decentralisation only works in certain areas. If you implemented it everywhere it just wouldn't make sense. Same as a Libertarian Government likely wouldn't work great on it's own. I think extracting key beliefs from each, and implementing them based on the situation is much more effective. For example, a decentralised currency such as Bitcoin makes sense. However, even Bitcoin is subject to more centralisation in certain areas. For example, mining.

### Original post:
I think this could be an interesting topic with interesting implications to bitcoin.What do you think: will China ever think of banning email?

### Reply 1:
I very much doubt it as the PRC government aren't really that concerned about ""private discussion"" between individuals (and mass emailing is generally fairly easy to identify) and also there is so much business that *depends* upon email (after all it's not as though they could turn to Facebook or Twitter).

### Reply 2:
Just use Armory. Receiver holds the watch-only copy and construct unsigned transaction, and send the unsigned transaction to the payer through email. The payer will sign and return it to the receiver by email, and the receiver will broadcast it.

Topic: Going off the Bitcoin radar
### Original post:
I'm contemplating forgetting about Bitcoin for the next year, then coming back afterwards to see how much I made or lost. No forums, no checking prices. Nothing.I think I'm spending too much of my time reading about it and not enough time on life.Has anyone successfully done this? Did you have BTC withdrawals?

### Reply 1:
I already did that once between 2011 and 2013 (as evidenced by my brief forum history). The last month was pretty cool. I might have to check out for another 2 years

### Reply 2:
I wouldn't ""leave"". Personally, I only hang out on Btalk and check out the prices when I have spare time. I don't make it a part of my life. Right now, everything is crashing and I am trying to find it's lowest point so I can buy back in cheap. I am in it for the long run anyway, so having as many coins as possible is my main objective. It may drop back down to $100 (doubt it), but I don't plan on selling my stash for another 20 years. It'll go up and down, and I'll play the market to make more coins. Come that day, I will have millions worth. In my opinion, it's well worth the few hours I spend bored messing around.

This is not so far i think it will happen in 2023-2024 also then bitcoin will go in higher position of worlds assets ranking and one day this day also obliviously come bitcoin will number 1 asset in the world and every people in the world will use bitcoin insted of any other currencies!!

### Reply 1:
When the price reaches $100K, one satoshi will not equal one cent. We will have to wait until it reaches $1M. I like the enthusiasm you have but at least base it on real facts and basic mathematics, not just feelings.

### Reply 2:
If the price stays closer to 90k than 30k, more miners will mine, the difficulty will rise and the price range can shift towards 100k.Also you may have been forgetting about the next halving, which, at the end of 2023 may have to start be counted into the price.So even without taking into account a big bubble, there are still chances for 100k get at least touched within that time frame. At least ""never say never"".Of course, you may have been also misled by OP ""math"" and assumed he was talking about 1m instead of 100k.

so, since the transactionfee was last adjusted in size, the value of bitcoin multiplied by more than tenfold again. Isn't it time to push back the fee by another 2 or 3 digits?

Topic: What is the legal status of Bitcoin in your country?
### Original post:
Some countries banned crypto assets totally, some banned mining, some allows even paying taxes with it and some doesn't allow purchasing goods using crypto assets.The Republic of Turkey has a strict ban against using crypto assets as a way of payment or developing technological infrastructure for such use case. However, it is perfectly legal for individuals and businesses to buy/sell/mine/trade the crypto assets.What is the situation in other countries that you know of? And do you think the world will start accepting it or will regulate and see it only as a ""store of value"" and not a currency?

### Reply 1:
While in Croatia we don't have any specific crypto law, you can do pretty much anything except pay taxes with it (AFAIK). So if you wanna report your trade profits, you would do it same as you would for stocks, while for example mining is taxed as 2nd income and the same would do for profits from signature campaigns (again AFAIK).Overall, situation in Croatia is pretty good for crypto enthusiasts, especially since there are ways to legally buy/sell up to 2,000 euro worth of crypto per day from crypto exchanges without any sort of KYC but somehow I think that won't last for long and sooner or later we will be hit with more strict regulation. But well, at least we can enjoy while it lasts as i know that in many countries you can't do that anymore.

### Reply 2:
Oh, I forgot to mention, in Turkey now the companies providing crypto asset services (exchanges, wallet providers, issuers etc.) are regulated and must follow specific KYC procedures. So there's that too.

### Original post:
I am facing a real world issue that prevents me from using Bitcoin.I live in Pakistan and for last three days cellular internet service all across the country is suspended because of prevailing law and order situation. Internet is working on fixed line connection that is reaching homes. So there is still some connectivity available.If government shut down internet service even on fixed line connection then there will be complete internet blackout in the country and in that situation we cant use bitcoin.I think this is also one of limitation of bitcoin that we need internet to use it.

### Reply 1:
This service is still not started in Pakistan they just got registered. The point is in case of Internet blackout we have no access to bitcoin.

### Reply 2:
There are alternative options, although they will take a bit of time and effort in order to set up and use.The easiest way to stay synced with the network without an internet connection is via Blockstream Satellite. It is possible to repurpose any old satellite dish in order to do this.In order to broadcast a transaction, you need to get it to someone with an internet connection. This might be someone who has bypassed government restrictions, or maybe someone who lives near a border and can use the connection of another country, or someone outside your country altogether. You can get it to them via a mesh network such as goTenna, via SMS, via radio, or any other way you like.

Topic: Bitcoin is Up by 16% Post Halving
### Original post:
The third bitcoin halving happened on May 11 during the coronavirus chaos. But the king of crypto seems unstoppable. Despite the biggest financial trials of our time, bitcoin was able to climb by 16% since the halving took place. BTCUSD was trading at $8,436 last Monday and started an upturn, briefly touching the $10,000 mark a bullish surge erasing its weekend crash. It is going up past $9,700 as of writing.<link>

### Reply 1:
Because people think that the block halving on Bitcoin could trigger the price of Bitcoin for parabolic move.Why? Because they are used to on previous block halvings on Bitcoin, they able to experience a huge price action for every block halving.But what other is waiting, the pump after the block halving, like months after, not before or during the block halving.Some people expecting it to happen around year 2021.

### Reply 2:
IMO Bitcoin price isn't affected by halving, pump and dump is normal in cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is high volatility, the price can change around 30%/day. Many people are always expecting bitcoin will bullish after halving. I won't surprise while Bitcoin is in bullish, many journalists will create a good news by correlating the price with halving. It's not always from halving FOMO, but supply and demand in markets.

Topic: can u send fake transactions in bitcoin ?
### Original post:
can u please tell me can i send a fake bitcoin transaction if its possible how it works ?i am using this information for school project

### Reply 1:
It is pretty obvious that this is not for school project because you can sure send BTC to any schoolmate you got then why make a fake transaction just to be presented into the class, Your professor obviously is against Bitcoin if that's the case, I don't really want to judge you for being a brand new rank but what is your real purpose behind this? But well if you are making a fake transaction that for me I think you can never do it, they might as well send it to a fake wallet because it will surely be recorded on the blockchain but expect your BTC long gone into the abyss.

### Reply 2:
You wouldn't be asking this question on this forum if it was possible. It wouldn't exist any more as no one would trust Bitcoin any more. The prime reason it took off in the first place is the way it managed to completely extinguish all doubt about the validity of a transaction. Without that Bitcoin has zero value. A 'fake' transaction cannot be broadcast, let alone mined and would never reach another wallet nor would it be sendable in the first place. Every aspect of Bitcoin's design squashes the possibility flat.You'll just be ignored completely. It will never appear anywhere.

Topic: Do not get scammed by this, specially newcomers.
### Original post:
I saw something on Quora that worried me. Someone said that he lost 1200 BTC to scammers. Then, I saw some people sharing/claiming to be experts in recovering lost bitcoin. They shared their contact details like Telegram IDs and WhatsApp numbers.I have a suspicion that the person who lost the BTC might be the same one giving out those contact details or advices. They could be trying to trick others in the future who search for help online. Google might suggest similar questions on Quora, and people could end up sharing their private keys with scammers.So, if you are new to all this, be careful. Don't trust random people claiming to be experts on Quora or anywhere else. They might just be trying to get your private information.This question: <link> to see more answers like these.

### Reply 1:
I can't even imagine someone claiming to restore a lost Bitcoin how and from where?This is just something that is not possible to do because I know too well that any bitcoin stolen or mistakenly sent to wrong address can never be restored all less you have a direct contact with the person who owns the address. But however only newbies can fall for this cheap scam methods.

### Reply 2:
Emphasis on the do not trust strangers online when it comes to your personal information or anything that makes you vulnerable to attacks. There have been similar threads like that here in Bitcointalk but the only difference here is that we have people that are constantly reporting such type of threads to be deleted and also giving neg-tags to those account but on quota you cant differentiate between legit posts and post made to deceive the readers.

Topic: A tax question about bitcoin as asset
### Original post:
If bitcoin is hold as long term saving asset, it will raise such a question:Current law says that when you have large amount of foreign currency gain due to exchange rate change, that is capital gain, should be taxed as capital income, similar to other type of capital gainBut that only applies when you cash out the bitcoin into domestic currency. If later you moved to abroad and invest/consume your bitcoins, I guess that country will not try to tax you, since for that country the foreign capital injection is always a benefit, if you try to tax them they will never arriveUnlike other assets (stocks/bonds/real estates), which can only be traded on domestic exchanges and be taxed accordingly, if you want to tax bitcoin, you must tax it before the people leave the boarder, but that is not OK because at that time the coins have not been exchanged into any other currency thus does not generate any taxable eventSo maybe it is not right to classify bitcoin as asset, an asset without boarder is in fact physically non-taxableI have this question when I just went through an old report that swedish bailiff are trying to find people evading tax with hidden bitcoins <link>

### Reply 1:
It is just considered a property in the United States, isn't it? It could be worse. Thank god we don't have to pay capital gain taxes on it.

### Reply 2:
^^^That.It all depends on where you are located and how Bitcoin is seen - is considered - there.In U.S. it is considered property.On the other hand there are countries that do not consider it at all.

Topic: How Bitcoin Centralizes Profit & Control in the Hands of Miners
### Original post:
In my opinion, one of the goals of Bitcoin was that the network would be 'decentralized' and owned by 'everyone' and 'no one'. However, it is very clear that there are two classes of people in the Bitcoin world. Those who 'own the network' and those who 'pay to use the network'. What I mean by this is that only miners profit directly from the operation of the network. Everyone else pays the miners through inflation or fees. Mining is now centralized to the point that 3 or 4 people could colude and control the majority of the hashing power. These people own the network, everyone else pays to play.It will always be the case (with Bitcoin) that specialization will tend make mining profitable only to a few and benefit from economics of scale. Unfortunately, the cost of running / operating the network isn't entirely born by the miners. Every user is providing bandwidth and mirroring services and these users are not reimbursed in any way. Miners, because they are centralized, will tend to favor more centralization, larger blocks, etc until all aspects of the network grow beyond what can be truly decentralized. I contend that an ideal crypto-currency should allow everyone who owns it to p<rest of post truncated>

Those damned miners and their elite membership. I wish I was born into a family that was allowed to mine but I was not born with such privelidge.Only the rich can mine, with their flying country to country in their private jets sipping on the blood of extinct animals.But alas, to join such a wealthy elite is beyond us simple folk. One cannot change their stars.

I too have experienced with the same scam approach through Instagram. Truly speaking anyone will fall for it, because they never ask for funds at the beginning. Request you to give them with a empty wallet which is completely under our control. Better is to stay active and avoid those scams.

People must be really stupid and naive,in order to fall into this scam.I don't see the point of connecting a wallet with ""mining pool"" and all that shit.The ""minimum requirement"" of having some coins in your wallet is completely stupid.More noobs should be aware of this scam.

Topic: What are your expectations ahead of pre and post BTC halving?
### Original post:
2020 was supposed to be an amazing year for me after buying some BTC and altcoins back in 2019 but the Corona virus came and had to dispose by crypto bag for survival before the bullrun came. It's a year I would never forget coz my life would have changed drastically if Covid 19 hadn't messed things up.Fast forward to 2023, I have been able to accumulate some few BTC from my monthly pay check and the news of Bitcoin spot ETF approval arosed my hope again that BTC might kickstart the mini bullrun before the halving but the reverse was the case as BTC fails to hit the $50k mark.While reading some crypto news earlier today, I came across a survey conducted by Bitget towards the end of last year in several region of the world where crypto investors share their anticipation and investment plan in crypto ahead of 2024 pre and post BTC halving and seeing 84% of the people saying BTC will cross the previous $69k ATH while also confirming they are increasing their investment ahead of the pre-halving makes me feel 2024 might be another good year for me.Although some expert suggested that people should be careful as BTC might trade around $30k - $60k within this period which makes it even a m<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
I don't care about the prices reflected by the analysts in the first place. Secondly if it is about investing then every dip is a buying opportunity. By accepting the Bitcoin ETF, this should be a sign that Bitcoin is still able to grow, especially in the price of Bitcoin. This has become a reflection of Bitcoin's long-term fundamentals, plus the deterioration of the dollar or fiat currency in each country as well as public perception of inflation in each country.If you intend to invest then make sure you buy and buy when the Bitcoin price drops and save. Sell when you feel like you have enough. If you worry and focus too much on someone's analysis, I'm sure you won't be optimal in investing or will even suffer losses due to being swayed by rumors and slanted news.

### Reply 2:
the survey is just a survey. it could happen or will not but our expectations as BTC holders will always go up pre and post-halving. no need to ask this but the only time BTC holder expects a dump is when the price already hits the ATH in the bull market.zooming out to the chart in the monthly time frame, i think we have a long bull market before we could reach the ATH. the bull market could end in mid-2025 or early 2026.

just because a burger existed prior to 'mcdonalds' does not mean the mcdonalds brand has no creativity when it first came outthe first goat that got randy with a female buffalo to breed off the first cow, does not mean that 'man' did not invent the burger(from cows). it does not mean because burgers come from cows that the cow made the first burgerjust because sheep make wool. does not mean that fashion designers are not creativedoes not mean that shirts, sweaters and socks were never invented. the guy that invented the wheel, first electric engine. is not the inventor/creator of a tesla car...satoshi created and invented bitcoin. founders are people that start their own company.. bitcoin is not even a company. ..bitcoin did not pre-exist in its form just waiting for someone to look under a rock and shout ""found it"" like lost propertybitcoin was created. many things had to be pieced together in a unique formation never seen before. thus it was created and invented and not by those names over the 40 years. bitcoin was put together(created and invented) by satoshiif people think that bitcoin is actually not created/invented in 2008-9 and instead is just something that existed for 40 <rest of post truncated>

As title says, I have tried to find and verify this news from other source, but still I am not getting anything. Do you guys know about this tweet and news? Found this tweet from Documenting Bitcoin . Tweet link: <link>

### Reply 1:
I think the twitter must be misinterpreting what google said would go into effect on august 3rd:Source: <link> i don't understand google, they let hyip site scammers do whatever they want for years and have never done anything to stop hyip site scammers from doing no harm, but google has gone to great lengths to ban bitcoin

### Reply 2:
I've tried to type bitcoin in google to see if there will be some top banner ads and search result ads but there's none that existed after typing that keyword.But if this is true, there will be more scammers that's going to take advantage of it and hopefully that they've got a better filtering this time as they allowed it again.

Topic: Add ""How to help [bitcoin]"" on front page/FAQ
### Original post:
I think many people are wondering what they should do to most effectively support bitcoin and secure its successful future. It would help to have this explained somewhere visibly. I believe the best thing everybody can do is to offer services and goods for bitcoins, that's what makes a currency useful, an ability to exchange it for as much diverse spectrum of what one might want as possible. It's also an investment as with every new thing that can be bought for bitcoins the value of bitcoins themselves rises.This can take many forms, it could be game (items for BTCs), support forum (BTCs as reward), micro-donations ... anything, but I think it's best to start with the virtual stuff ... or not creativity is key ...

### Reply 1:
Ah, I saw that already and forgot But it's still buried in the wiki (which is not linked from the main page) and does not contain the most important point IMO, that is *use bitcoins* to provide a service (good). If there is nothing to buy for bitcoins there is no incentive to use them.Thanks

### Reply 2:
I added ""How to help Bitcoin"" to the FAQ.I don't think it matters very much if the sidebar link says ""Documentation"" or ""Wiki"". Or does it?

This will only drive closer the adoption of Bitcoin to the public.

Topic: Why people don't adopt Bitcoin - they don't understand Expected Value
### Original post:
First, check this video - <link> it's a social experiment where the guy offers random people on the street to take a bet where they have a decent advantage, and almost all people refuse it. Why? Because they don't know math and can't calculate that the expected value of such bet is big and positive. Instead they are being guided by psychology - human mind feels negative emotions more strongly than the positive, and negative memories are stronger than the positive. Fear of losing is stronger than the desire to profit.This is one of the reasons why Bitcoin adoption is so low. Everyone is aware of volatility, of big rallies and big crashes. Avoiding big risks is the default course of action for most people, even if big risks have positive expected value.

### Reply 1:
Hmmm i don't know, but i feel if that video were to be done in my locality, i bet you will probably see more going for the first time risk rather than reasoning the losses that is involved in it. Same feat applys to the adoption of bitcoin in my locality most people just like taking the chance of new means of possible making profits even if it involves them not knowing much about the platforms. I guess that's why bitcoin adoption and awareness is growing massively in my area.

### Reply 2:
I don't think that's an appropriate approach to compare to bitcoin adoption. The fact is that nobody loses anything (in terms of ownership) even in a minus portfolio condition.I'm interested in quoting one of the responses in the video, ""I'm thinking more about what I lose than what I win"". How about a little fairer, changing the conditions of ""the coin will be flipped a certain number of times so it wins your choice"", like the way holding works.

### Reply 2:
Why would you want feedback on that article? That topic is pretty much being discussed and accepted a few years ago. It doesn't really contribute anything extraordinary in the existing content. From the point of writing skills, yeah it's nicely done but lacks references. When you make a point, have a reference to support it. That is how literature writing works.

Topic: More Evidence Paypal (eBay) hates Bitcoin
### Original post:
I listed a 7970 GPU with a mounted Antec 920 water cooler on eBay with a buy it now for $500. A buyer bought it and then paid for it through the automatic Invoice system. The payment never showed up on my paypal account. The buyer provided a transaction number. I contacted paypal and they said the user sent the funds to the wrong email address. They had left one letter out of the email address. Paypal said the user would have to cancel the payment and resend it. sounds reasonable. The buyer has not been. But wait, it was done through the automatic invoice system, the user doesn't enter the email address. Now some how eBay has the item ad refunded by me, so I cannot file a non paying buyer complaint. I'm stuck with a $54 fee for an item that essentially didn't sell. I cannot leave negative or otherwise non positive feedback for the buyer, I cannot contact eBay. I have a long standing (like 12+ years) account on eBay with a rating over 100.I have never had so much trouble. Ok why do I say they hate Bitcoin. I mentioned I used the GPU for a month to mine Bitcoins. One other auction I had listed was ended early because it referred to bitcoin mining. Since when is it illegal to mine or <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Certainly serious if the problem was related to mentioning Bitcoin. But did eBay/Paypal stop the auction because of that? Or is this just some other problem with the buyer?That said, I have also been running into more bad buyers lately, people who come in and bid on an item, then never pay up. What a pain!

### Reply 2:
You guys too... trust me stay away from eBay companies, paypal, kijiji. Something screwy is happening with them and Bitcoin right now.There are too many stories circulating around about odd behaviour with ebay: buyers getting accounts revoked, listings being canceled, insane periods for listings to post which normally take only seconds, etc.Just don't do it, start frequenting bitcoin friendly sites.

What are you talking about this is not at all part of the process LOL. All that someone needs to do is is submit the deposit, registration form and a copy of government issued identification. What I find comical about the process is this:It looks like someone can't use a vanity address that is ""obscene"" I also am not sure how the USMS is going to determine that a public address is ""located"" in a specific country that is restricted by OFAC. This statement makes me think they don't really understand how bitcoin works

OK so I tried registering. Just for the heck of it. Curious to see what a commercial test would rate me in terms of aptitude (just Bitcoin right?).Anyway, once you register and are logged in, you can't click on any part of the Aptitude course. It just shows me a table, with the 1 module and 2 units. Can't enter, can't click can't anything. No test to take.Library suggests the site belongs to a Travis Patron

### Reply 2:
I did... and there's still no hyperlink available. Shows the course, the Unit 1 and 2. But no hyperlink. It shows me my username so I think the registration worked. Funny thing is I didn't get any confirmation email in my inbox used to register though. Maybe that needs to happen and I need to verify first?Anyone else tried with success? Purely out of curiosity for me.

This would also act as a deterrent against future attacks, and would also test the reaction of the Bitcoin network to a reorg event.On the con side, Zhao acknowledged that a reorg event might damage Bitcoin?s credibility, as well as potentially causing a permanent split in not only the Bitcoin blockchain but in the cryptocurrency community too.how should we all think of it as a community

Topic: Bitcoin Scalability
### Original post:
Hello guys,I have just one question. I am collecting some information about Bitcoin Scalability for my school work. Can please someboy write me all methods which are considered as Bitcoin scalability solutions ? when I try to google it everything what I found is:- Hard Fork - change block size- Lightning Network- ShardingIs there any other methods which might solve the bitcoin scalability problem ? Thank you.

### Reply 1:
the first one is scaling bitcoin. the other two are locking funds and diverting people over to other networks using pegged tokens not real bitcoin.. its like converting gold to a bank notelightning doesnt use blockchains and doesnt have the mass validation and is more private. thus comes with riskssharding is more regional blockchains with a master chain. a true scaling solution is ofcourse allowing more transactions on the bitcoin network and not trying to make using bitcoin too expensive to use.

### Reply 2:
increasing block size doesn't improve scalability. it just linearly increases transaction throughput while also linearly increasing bandwidth, latency, and storage costs.like the lightning network, <truncated> intend to scale the bitcoin network by sending transactions off-chain onto separate protocols which interact with bitcoin.physical bearer instruments are another possible solution for scalability. ""bitcoin sticks"" can be passed around like cash, removing the need for on-chain transactions at all.

Topic: What exactly are we mining?
### Original post:
Ok simple question, Its my understanding that SHA256/MD5 and any other hash cannot be reversed hashed..?So What are all these ASCI/video cards hashing/hacking.. ?Main reason I am asking was talking to someone today and was telling him about Bitcoin and what was going on but when it came to the hashing part I was stumped. Didnt understand enough to explain it to him.All that I learned from bitcon and how I got started was from this podcast <link> one other thing if anyone say 15 years from now wants to start mining solo/other and they need the bitcoin block chain. Can you imagine how much data is going to be downloaded? Let along say 50+ years from now the storage/bandwidth needed just to get started to mine.Thanks for the info/help.

Topic: Does this Pandemic intensifies the usage of Bitcoin?
### Original post:
We are all still currently experiencing the effect of pandemic and most of us do still tend to stay at home to avoid getting infected by the virus.My question is that does this pandemic intensifies the usage of Bitcoin knowing that physical or paper money might also be a carrier of the virus once pass on hand might caught droplets bringing the virus from a certain individual.Using Bitcoin provides cashless experience that we know safer with this pandemic so, does this means that people will tend to use Bitcoin at this time or still into fiat?

### Reply 1:
Probably in some countries yes, more Bitcoin users are using it right now for payments (if the merchant is accepting it). Here in my country, I didn't felt that Bitcoin usage has increased since the pandemic. I'd say that online transactions had increased massively because of the fact that the physical cash can be a carrier of virus but base on my experience, I saw many people here using e-cash rather than using Bitcoin. People right now are paying what they are buying online using digital cash and not Bitcoin here unfortunately because many still don't know how to use it for transactions. In my part, Bitcoin helped me too to buy some things but I don't use it directly as a payment but I'm converting it into digital cash where that is the one I will use for payments online.

### Reply 2:
Based on my observation, the prevalence of bitcoin as a mode of payment in my country is very low, we have delivery services app and they are adapting on how to make a contactless transaction even with physical money as a mode of money, cash apps are the most prevalent because more people know what to do with it and it is also in our country's currency.

In a recent interview with CNBC, Gene Simmons stated that he has entered Bitcoin with all his assets.Rockstar is convinced that Bitcoin will be traded at a price of $ 60,000 by the beginning of next year:""So, Im all in, Im putting all in. When there was a big dip and it went downIve put in more.""As reported by U.Today, the musician, who has become a businessman, revealed that he had a seven-digit bitcoin fortune in February.Simmons entered the world of cryptocurrencies at the beginning of the epidemic because of his relationship with Tyler Winklevoss. He quickly became a fan of cryptocurrencies, which even led some to accuse Simmons of receiving wages with some <truncated> from Bitcoin, the KISS star also owns Ethereum, Cardano, Polkadot, and UniSwap.Simmons likes the fact that cryptocurrencies leave digital fingerprints, which he says make it easier to tax than gold.He added that his fans could now use the cryptocurrencies to purchase his artwork, which will be available later this year.Source: <link>

All in bitcoin is a wise decision along with high risk. There are common users who have profited with such kind of all in one investment. Earlier sold all his properties, stocks and went to a refugee campaign for the rest of his life. Within few months there happened a big bull market that could've given him big profit. So, it is all about the time. If the holding is for long term profiting then surely he'll profit out of the investment unlike the risk.

### Reply 2:
It's like a two headed snake concept.Some old people says, one head of two headed snake is not a poisoness.But we don't know, which head is poison less.If you place all the bet in the investment, you may earn huge.But the option will be investing the money into two to three different assets.Atleast one will gives you minor profit with a period.

Topic: There are only 21 THOUSAND bitcoins
### Original post:
We could say there are ONLY 21 THOUSAND bitcoins, and have them subdividable like 11 decimal points. Just to put a perspective on the arbitrariness of how we define the limit.Actual BTC limit = <truncated> just as easily be: 21000.00000000001Or even: 21.00000000000001 (only 21 bitcoins in existance! lol)So, we could say ""21 thousand bitcoins ONLY!"" But does that mean there are only 21 thousand bitcoins? No.They're all the SAME QUANTITY of UNITS allowable. Pretty arbitrary really.Just food for thought.A great way of putting it.Right now, I bet it would be beneficial to move the decimal place a few points to the right so that people feel like they're getting more bitcoin. That psychological effect is a big one.As an uninformed public I'd much rather have 200 microbitcoins (or whatever) worth $200 total than 2 bitcoins worth $200 total. I bet it would lead to a lot more adoption purely on the psychological implications alone.

### Reply 1:
What brought that up? Are you replying to another thread? Not sure of your point (or logic).Edit...now I see what you are trying to point out. But like it was said by calian, it is just a ledger entry.

Circle Executed $24 Billion in OTC Trades in 2018source : <link> are a lot of transactions through OTC and based on the above article OTC transactions are not reflected in the cryptocurrency market <link> since there is OTC does not require 3rd party like crypto Exchanges.I was thinking, maybe there are bigger transactions done through OTC combine, compared to the total marketcap now which is $130,315,196,527 What's your thoughts on this?

### Reply 1:
I know it's impossible to determine the exact figure but I believe it's higher compared to the total amount being traded in all combine exchanges.What's your opinion?

### Reply 2:
I really have no idea. But knowing that OTC trades are definitely trades with huge amounts of money(which is why they trade through OTC in the first place), then it's possible(while probably a bit unlikely I think).

### Original post:
Here is a great post about transaction types that may be possible now or in the future.<link> really like the Assurance Contracts because how it can be done without third parties.

### Reply 1:
Actually you could do this probably easier with a Open Transactions smart contract, technically it is designed for this kind of thing bitcoin less so ... but installing OT and managing contracts is still a hurdle for most users.

### Reply 2:
Lol ... and an excellent point to boot ... a ""bitcoin is not real money"" statement should be just agreed with, or reposted with a cryptic answer such as.A : Bitcoin is not real money!B: But what is real money?The key here is that ""real money"" lacks a precise definition, Alan Greenspan, then Chairman of Fed. Res., someone you would think qualified to know about these things stated this in congressional testimony. So they will always be right, bitcoin is not real money because in fact no such a thing exists since it hasn't been precisely defined.Call it what you will, but just like land, gold, silver, exotic collectables, diamonds, property, stocks and a myriad of other liquid assets, it appears value can be stored and transferred using these crazy digital keys, becoming commonly known as bitcoins.I would say bitcoin is nothing like money as we have known it and although bitcoin is NOT money it does not stop it being valuable. Bitcoin is a value information transfer and storage technology. You may or or may not call it money, as you wish, that does not stop it being what it is.

### Reply 1:
That was my feeling months ago too. His bullshit only digs his grave even deeper than it already was. If I was him, I'd stop right now with all the shit I was saying because it's going nowhere good.Honestly, at this point I wouldn't be surprised if he really was the one who stole from MtGox and has now basically revealed it himself. Taking into account all the lies he spread around and everything he's done so far, it would really be no surprise on my side. I'm just impatiently waiting for his fame to burn away because the only reason he keeps doing what he's doing is that he is the creator of a shitcoin that now somehow still sits in the 6th place of cryptos.

### Reply 2:
So let's get this straight: CSW had no backup, that is no cold storage backup of the private keys. Does anyone think, given Satoshi's comments about wallet backups on here and elsewhere, that Satoshi (a) had his private keys online, and (b) had no backup? CSW, yes, he seems like an idiot. Satoshi, no.Anyone who believes CSW's BS is just asking to be taken for a ride.

Topic: Blockchain domains cannot be removed or deleted!
### Original post:
I think we are in an exciting time to have blockchain domains where people can finally protect and share whatever content they choose without being censored. I think this is a super important use case seeing that companies are choosing what they want us to see and what they think isn't 'appropriate'The other pretty cool thing is the same domain can be used as your crypto wallet address <link> explainer video<link>

### Reply 1:
The main idea of this project is very <truncated> just using a simple domain instead of that complex wallet address with long stretch of letters and numbers. Here your domain is your wallet address so you can buy a domain name with your very name on it and whenever someone is asking for your wallet address just share the domain you registered in this site. Well, very useful indeed. Now, I wonder why the use of .zil then I read that it is because this is launched in the Zilliqa blockchain and a grantee of the Zilliqa Foundation to work with the extension. I am then wondering: Will it mean that my domain name is the same wallet address I can use for all cryptocurrencies and tokens...meaning the same for Bitcoin, Eth, and the rest of the gang?

### Reply 2:
That's actually really cool. I really like having one address for multiple coins. I feel like this is something that the general public will really take to more than a long string of characters and numbers

Simple poll. Assuming technology keeps up, should Bitcoin be usable by everyone who wants to use it at a reasonable cost, which might be a few cents per transaction, or a new elite, where most people are priced away to 3rd-party services?Who are ""Everyone""? This means people from all parts of the world, Mali in Africa to Bali in Indonesia, all walks of life, in developed or developing countries.What is the ""new Elite""? It is not one of the old fiat elites, like the NWO, or banksters, it is part of the new broom to sweep all that away, a Bitcoin-elite, such as found at Bitcoin-Assets #bitcoin-assets, An elite who have a core principle that it does not matter if ordinary bitcoiners can't use the blockchain where fees might be $5 or $10 per transaction.What do YOU think? Please VOTE!

### Reply 1:
In Bitcoinland elites will rise and fall while in the fiat world elites are sticking no matter what ""Ooops, let's just print some money..."".

It's for everyone, and will benefit the poor disproportionately. Lucky them.

Just go with Binance[1]. You wouldn't even need to submit KYC as long as you withdraw less than 42 BTC per day. So far, it seems to be pretty secure.. so far. As always, never leave significant amounts of cryptocurrencies on exchanges unless you're actively trading them.[1] <link> Changed 4 --> 2 BTC

### Reply 2:
I always advise Binance in these cases since I have never faced any sort of problems so far. There are many other exchanges available to address your problem op, but Binance is the best option. Don't forget to enable 2FA when you make an account there.

Topic: BITCOIN AS A LEGAL TENDER
### Original post:
Please I ask the forum do you think Bitcoin can be installed as a means of legal tender in advance county like CHINA, USA , ENGLAND, JAPAN etc...Seeing it's getting close to it's mining 21million limit

### Reply 1:
My opinion is that this is very unlikely (almost impossible) in the countries you mention. China has already clearly defined its position on Bitcoin and all other altcoins, and given its political system, it cannot accept anything that it cannot fully control. The US and England are among the world's largest economies and will not allow another currency to become equal to the national currency, with the addition that the Bank of England has a very negative attitude towards Bitcoin. In Japan, Bitcoin has been a legal tender for years, but not in the way it is in El Salvador. The difference is that in Japan it is possible to do business easily by accepting Bitcoin as a currency, while in El Salvador Bitcoin is legally equated with the national currency and anyone who wants to pay something with Bitcoin must have that <truncated> rich and developed countries are not the ones to look at when it comes to accepting Bitcoin as a legal tender in the literal sense of the word.

1. You can buy fractions (decimals) of a bitcoin2. Purchasing of bitcoin will always be available in the market. Not 100% of the bitcoin holders are solely holding, a good chunk will always be for sale on exchanges3. The 21 million limit will be reached (not exactly 21m but yea) likely sometime around year 2140, so we're really not that 'close'

Topic: In theory there is still another China ban waiting to be launched.
### Original post:
According to bitnodes and ethernodes, there are around 150 BTC public nodes and 400 ETH public nodes located in China.CCP hasn't launched an ISP level blockade yet which is one of the few cards reserved in their hands.Since BTC has 3000+ nodes in TOR (Can't tell how many ETH nodes in TOR) , I think users in China could still have access to full nodes then.

### Reply 1:
150 out of 10 000, barely 1% shutting them down is not even worth trying, if anyone in China wanted to connect to a full node they would have probably used a VPN even before this. As for tor unless you use bridges and update them continuously as they get blocked one by one you will never be able to use it. Plus the speeds are horrible, I doubt too much block distribution is happening in China over tor.So no, this blockade would mean nothing, unless they trial a few bitcoin owners for god know what crime against society and shoot them there is nothing more that can come out of china.

### Reply 2:
150 Bitcoin nodes running in China is nothing compared to total number of nodes, nobody can stop them and they can always switch to Tor if government choose to ban them with their firewall.I also think that many people from China have vpn to access twitter, telegram, youtube and all other services that are blocked in their country.This will not affect Bitcoin in any serious way and it's especially not important with number of ethereum nodes you mentioned.

Topic: I Want To Invest Money From My Inheritance In Bitcoin, But?
### Original post:
After my father died 3 weeks ago, we as 5 brothers agreed to fulfill my father's wishes by selling part of his land to be sold and distributed to 5 members. So my parents' house still has 250 meters of land next to my parents' house which is currently still occupied by my mother and two younger siblings and the land area of the house is also quite large.Long story short, from the sale of 250 meters of land, 5 family members each received $4,400. And I have plans to buy Bitcoin to increase my Bitcoin amount in the near future so that the money is not reduced for unimportant purposes. Because it cannot be denied that if I see large amounts of cash, I will definitely want to buy what I want, not what I need.And what confused me was that 2 of my family members, namely 1 older brother and 1 younger brother, wanted to share some of their money to invest in my Bitcoin. And they themselves don't want to do it for reasons, they don't want to bother.Even if he wants, I will teach him to make a Bitcoin wallet. But they still don't want to and want to combine their money with my money to invest in Bitcoin, and they already know that I have been involved with Bitcoin for a long time and they al<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
I do hope you are aware of the risks involved when investing in crypto or any other digital assets and thus why they always emphasize that you should invest what you can afford to lose so that should anything go wrong, you won't end up in a rock bottom and depressing situation.It would be preferable that your other interested family members also decided to invest on their own and not make you the custodian of their money. Money breeds enmity even among family members as you grow. If things don't work out, you will be in a tight spot. It's better you just guide them through, and they also do the fishing for themselves.

### Reply 2:
I think the reason why they don't want to have or make own a Bitcoin is because they have zero knowledge of how to protect the wallet that is why they decided to put their money into you because they know you have knowledge of how to protect them. It is just likely the same happened to me with my friend since he doesn't know much about Bitcoin and the risk of the internet he wants to buy Bitcoin and wants to send it to me and hold it for him because I know how to protect his Bitcoin.Meaning your two brother trust you about their investment in Bitcoin.What I would like to suggest make an offline wallet with two different and seed backups using the Electrum wallet make sure that you write them on the piece of paper put their Bitcoin in each of these wallets and then try to give the piece of paper to your two brothers and tell them that this is their wallet backup.If they don't want then keep them in a safe place where no one knows where you hide them. Also don't forget to take one of the BTC addresses (Public key) from each wallet where you deposited BTC and then don't forget to erase the wallet from the offline device where you created these two wallets or format the hard drive for <rest of post truncated>

eideteker: Can you ask the skeptics what we, the Bitcoin Community, could do to be less ""smelly"" or ""sketchy"" ?I find people are much more sympathetic if instead of saying ""What's your problem?"" you instead ask ""What am I doing wrong, and how can I fix it?""And then you can get all jujitsu on them and praise their great ideas and gently suggest that you'd only screw up whatever it is they are suggesting (and you're busy doing other stuff already) so maybe they should just go ahead and do it...

Full story: <link> Grayscale got $700m in funding recently I just wanted to share some details about GBTC that many people might not understand. You can read the full article above, but here are the main takeaways: When buying shares of GBTC, youre paying a premium, which is calculated by the value difference of the holdings versus the holdings market price. This calculation can be referred to as the Native Asset Value or NAV.Grayscale has two investment types: buying shares directly on the open market, and the other is supplying BTC into the fund, and receiving shares. To invest Bitcoin in the fund, you must be <truncated> can purchase shares through their traditional investment brokerage accounts and may get tax advantages.If Bitcoin goes up, youll make more money if you buy the premium at a low. If Bitcoin drops, you will have a more significant loss than merely holding the asset directly.Have any of you purchased GBTC instead of BTC? If so, why?

### Reply 1:
When the Bitcoin price rises, similar news starts to appear. I think this kind of news is made consciously.No relationship between these news and btc price

### Reply 2:
Grayscale does not buy or sell bitcoins. They exchange shares for bitcoins, and investors can buy or sell shares.Currently, Grayscale does not allow redemption of shares, so there is no immediate danger of an investor redeeming shares for bitcoins and selling those bitcoins.

### Original post:
Im ditching traditional banks in favor of bitcoinand you can, too<link>

### Reply 1:
I would ditch my bank for the simple reason that they favor the rich and exploit the poor. The more money you deposit, the higher your interest rate and the less money you have in your account, the higher the fees. Some of these banking services even give free transactions to people, if they maintain more than a specific amount of money in their account. Bitcoin treats everyone the same, no matter how much money you have. ^smile^

Topic: Bitcoin Killer App
### Original post:
This is a spin-off from the Famous quotes about bitcoin? thread. Specifically, it is prompted by this quote:Most people here realize that the internet existed for years prior to the first browser and the ""world-wide-web."" The web has often been described as the killer-app that brought the masses to the internet. I feel that the quote above is very prescient. From this I have a few questions for anyone interested in speaking their minds:1) A distributed exchange is often mentioned as a critical missing piece needed for wide-spread bitcoin adoption. Must a distributed exchange be in place before we have a ""killer-app"" for bitcoin?2) Are there other critical pieces missing from the bitcoin infrastructure that need to be filled before we can have a true ""killer-app"" for bitcoin? If so, what are they?3) What will ultimately be the ""killer-app"" for bitcoin?I'll probably get flamed because some of this has been talked about before, but that's okay. I think that the quote above really does put things in perspective though.

### Reply 1:
This is about progress on the most promising (my opinion) distributed exchange. Do you think that is the killer-app that will bring the masses to bitcoin?

### Reply 1:
Can you explain why you believe a model with several competing implementations of the protocol wouldn't work? In fact, with the emergence of BitcoinXT it looks like it is beginning to work. The consensus critical code would of course need to be compatible between implementations; however, if a change was desired by the community (e.g., increasing the block size limit), each implementation could attempt to solve it ""their own way"" and then the community would decide the winner by switching to the implementation they favoured. Then, to retain some portion of their previous user base, the losing implementations would adopt the same change to the consensus code to prevent their clients from forking off from the longest proof-of-work chain when the change goes into effect (at some future time similar to BIP101). Is this a way to give the community more power in exercising their free choice?

### Reply 2:
Well, Mike and Gavin just proved this to be wrong.It actually doesn't. Otherwise XT would not have come into existance in the first place... XT is the results of the Core team ignoring a large part of the market that are asking for scalability faster than what they were projecting which IS a problem due to centralization.

After learning about Bitcoin I've learned about finance and investing in general(and other supplementary topics).

Bitcoin is revolutionary in lots of aspect specially in financial sector however the tech behind bitcoin have now opened a new unique space of decentralized technology which were quite hidden in past. Smart contract, decentralize storage, stores, exchange are also emerging out due to bitcoin and blockchain technology.Even blockchain based games are being quite popular due to fairness and transparency it have in its results.

### Reply 2:
The origin of Bitcoin was definitely born in the anti-establishment and anti-banking sector of the community, but has since progressed tosomething much bigger. Yes, the revolutionary views are still strong in a huge part of it's users, but without government support it will end up in the hands of the revolutionary only. We need to pull all resources and people together to make this work.. not just the small group of revolutionary people who started this.

Topic: Potentially miners attack?
### Original post:
Since February 2023 mempool almost not empty and i thought that 2-3 biggest pool can spam mempool with low-fee transactions just to get more fee. Just check out this block: <link> block is full of $0.08 cent transactions with $0.24 cents fee. Probably we need additional compression for transactions like this because that all have same amount, fee and OUTPUT address, or some other solution. I heard that Stratum V2 firmware can potentialy solve some problems by giving more freedom to individual miner, which can avoid this transactions. What are you thinking about it ?

### Reply 1:
I think this is somewhat similar with dust attack tho I just know it today, But if this spamming Bitcoin work we should see the spike in Bitcoin fee in the next block but after watching your Block transaction the next block and other blocks are still at the 6 sat/vb.

### Reply 2:
So are all other blocks at that time, what's so special about it?Besides, it's not full of 8 cents fees, it also has stuff like this in it:<link>3,832,070 sat $1,107What is wrong with those transactions?They are valid transactions, getting accepted by nodes, and they pay the fee just like others, who are you or anyone else to decide what should be allowed and what not? Besides, the individual miner, unless he somehow manages to get 2-3 Exahash of hashing power so, about 10-20 thousand miners at least can't and won't be able to do a thing.Yeah, let's start censoring stuff we don't like because obviously, that's what Bitcoin was designed for!Next will be thumblers and mixers because they make hundreds of tx, then there will be consolidations cause they also take too much space, then transactions under 10$ cause they present no interest then banning transactions between same wallets as they also clog the mempool, then miners won't accept transactions unless the owner of the originating address hasn't already submitted a sperm sample along his KYC data.

Topic: The 2021 weird mining nonce: ""The Race To 4B is On""
### Original post:
Did you catch this weird mining nonce in the first half of 2021?It was a sentence, ""The race to 4b is on"", although some characters were changed to 733t speak (encoded in base..64? or was it base58?).The nonce awarded 1 bitcoin to the miner instead of the possible 6. Mining nonces are supposed to be random, so a full sentence seems.. intentional?It is my guess that mining rewards are not entirely random, but based on previous transactions. If this is true, this could give certain miners an advantage who saved all of their transaction details -- and determined what part of their transactions have the possibility to become parts of future mining nonces. Perhaps the sentence was intentional, somehow? Or is that implausible?Did you see this mining nonce? I lost the full details or I'd post it, sorry.

### Reply 1:
Sorry, I lost the nonce / block height. It was in the first half, probably first quarter of 2021. It was an award of 1 bitcoin, which can help separate out which of the mining rewards did this. There was absolutely this sentence within the mining nonce, whatever the cause is. (Even if untrue, I do wonder what the effect of having previous transactions help lead to future mining nonces would be. This might be a way to balance layer 1 and layer 2 needs, as you don't want layer 1 to be completely abandoned, and there should be benefits for transacting on layer 1, while at the same time miners should benefit for keeping the systems running. Proof of transaction+work is an interesting model.)

### Reply 2:
It was a reward of 1. Damn, I should have found it before bringing it up. I have the block height on a computer somewhere, but I was seeing whether anyone else noticed so I didn't have to search for it. I'll tag you if I find it. Maybe it was the hash instead of the nonce that turned into this sentence. The 733t-script sentence was in the middle of other random characters, so not exactly a easily scriptable search.

### Reply 2:
A lot of people claim themselves as Satoshi to get the attention of many people and to get the benefits that they wanted but little did they know that they are just making their life miserable, why? because people will find a way to prove that they are the fake one and besides they can't even show a single proof that they are Satoshi. Also, if he is Satoshi why would he choose to hide himself for a long time and decided to show up? what is the specific reason? does he really think that people will believe in him just because he has knowledge about bitcoin? don't let yourself be deceive by him and by his words because he isn't Satoshi.

Topic: What can you buy with bitcoin? Apparently, some weird shit.
### Original post:
So I saw this topic by Kprawn just a minute ago, with the question ""What is the weirdest thing you have seen for sale for Bitcoin? "". I was going to answer there, but since I really want people to know this(just because), I decided to create my own topic about it instead.Sorry in advance to Kprawn for stealing your topicSo, what can you buy with bitcoin in 2019? Oh boy some of you people probably haven't heard of this yet.......Bath water.Yep. You guessed it right. Water from a bath tub whereas some female Twitch streamer took a hot bath in.And also, it went out of stock one time.. so apparently people are actually buying them..Source: <link> what do people do with the water? You ask.Maybe people take a bath in them?...Apparently, based on some Reddit replies I've read(that I 100% hope that people are just trolling), some people drink them. Let that sink in.But wait! There's more..It doesn't end with bath water.So I took my detective hat on and investigated what this Twitch streamer is selling besides bath water.Well..No one probably is going to buy that $9,999 jar of pee (I freakin hope), but yea. I lost a bit of faith in humanity when I saw this. Probably fake, idk, but don't und<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
thats a total BS buddy,when i read the top of the topic though its very cheap and weird i did tolerate because some fanatics may have a satisfaction if they have the bath water just like having a water from Jordan river of those who believes in miracle that it will cure them.but the PEE?and that CHEWED gum?that's Insane would those fan Chew as well the gum?and will they smell that expired PEE?i do't know what is happening in the world right now,but even if that is from my most admired woman in the world yet wont do anything as stupid as that.

### Reply 2:
If I recall correctly, when this thing first came out, some news sites actually wrote several articles about this. The ""GamerGirl Bath Water"" was sold out in a few hours and the girl (the seller) actually restocked it after a few days. Shockingly enough, it was sold out once again almost instantly.Although it may seem like ""weird shit"" to us, the market is there. When there is a demand, there's supply.\_()_/

Topic: BitcoinOPX expanded trading to Gold, Euros, Stocks and more [Feedback Requested]
### Original post:
Hey everyone,We are working on expanding trading beyond bitcoins. We currently use a contract for difference model to settle option, and are looking to add direct contracts for difference too. The advantage of CFD is traders don't need to own the underlying asset which makes it possible to trade basically anything with a market price. We're thinking to limit the items we start with to Gold, Euros, and tech stocks like Google, Apple, Amazon, and Yahoo. However, it's possible to include commodities such as oil, wheat, cocoa, sugar etc. Which items would you like to see?Contract for Difference ExampleGold rises $6.00 to $1594.70 and Bob thinks it's now headed lower. He creates a contract for difference as a Seller for 5 units of Gold at a price of $1590.00.Bob's offer in the Order Book = Sell 5 Gold oz. @ $1590.00.Susan thinks gold is headed higher so she accepts Bob's offer.Susan's offer in the Order Book = Buy 5 Gold oz. @ $1590.00.The contract for difference stipulates a Seller will pay the Buyer the difference between the contract price and market price at contract time (contracts mature every Friday at 6 pm). If the difference is negative the Buyer pays the Seller.At maturity the<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
It's interesting you should say that because I saw an article the other day on Yahoo! Finance titled ""How to know whether you're investing or gambling"". With the stock market nowadays I would call it more of a gamble.More direct to your concern, though, contracts for difference DO allow delivery of the underlying assets because you are paid the amount required to purchase them. That's the point. Take ounces of gold for example. Say you have none and want to purchase 5 ounces. But you're about to go on vacation and that will tie up your money. You think to yourself that's too bad because gold prices are about to rise for sure! Say you are in Susan's position in the example above. You would certainly take Bob's offer to BUY the 5 ounces of the contract. This way if gold prices rise as you think they will you will be paid enough to actually buy the 5 ounces as if the price had not moved when you return from vacation.This works with any underlying asset, whether bitcoins, stocks, or oil. And it's no different than buying or selling stocks or whatever directly timed for when you think the price will rise or fall.There is no reason for us to buy a warehouse attempting to try to store and<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 2:
Without the option of delivery of the underlying asset this to me is more or less just gambling and I'd really hope you'd want to include the option of delivery and contribute to the future convertibility making bitcoins a better money in the process.

Topic: Paper Wallets For Tipping
### Original post:
Last night I ordered a pizza for my family and I. I used a gift card to pay. I dont carry cash but I have a bunch of unused paper wallets. When the delivery girl got to my house I asked, Do you use bitcoin? I could tell she knew of it, but wasnt to familiar. So, I told her I want to tip her, but would she accept bitcoin. Her eyes lit up and she agreed.So, I grabbed a spare paper wallet, scanned the QR code, sent the tip, gave her the wallet, and before she left I told her to google bitcoin paper wallet cash out or something like that if she wants fiat. She genuinely seemed excited.I did same thing a few days ago and that delivery boy had the same reaction.For people who are unsure or skeptical, I think this is a good idea for everyone in the space bc 1)its a direct connection to ones labor, 2) the face-to-face voluntary transaction of tipping is apart of the Satoshi ethos, 3)its something physical, 4)the physical paper will help them understand the abstract aspect of money and 5)it creates a financial incentive for them to give bitcoin cursory examination, at least. At that point, I hope they continue down the Rothbardian hole and see the fed (and all central banking) for the crimi<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
This is a good way to promote bitcoin. The only problem I see here is if they lose the paper wallet or they ignore the importance of the private keys on those wallets. They are newbies in crypto and they can easily make mistakes that can cost them the money.You are tipping them, not scamming them. What is the use of sending funds to the paper wallet if you will transfer them anyway? Just send them empty paper wallet then if that is your intention.

### Reply 2:
I've actually thought about it, but never used it. When I have food delivered, I usually tip a few euro at most. The most used local exchange service has a minimum payout amount of 10 euro. Add the Bitcoin transaction fees, and the minimum amount required is much more than a decent tip, while a large part of it is lost to fees.I've given away funded paper wallets though, it's better when the occasion justifies a larger monetary amount.

Topic: Ex-CIA Director Proved Bitcoin Use in Illicit or Crime to be disprove
### Original post:
Former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Acting Director Michael Morell wrote a report titled An Analysis of Bitcoins Use in Illicit Finance. The ex-government employee had over 33 years working at the Agency.Published by the Crypto Council for Innovation, Morells investigation attempts to disprove a thesis defended by many authorities around the world: Bitcoin is a tool to finance cybercrime and other illicit activities.Morell considers Bitcoin to have a growing momentum and a spreading use as a store of value. Endorsed by companies like Tesla and MicroStrategy, cryptocurrency is riding a major wave of adoption.To achieve his goal, Morell consulted many experts in financial services, payment systems, global intelligence, even former senior government officials. The Ex-CIA director himself used to believe Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are a convenient way of sending money <truncated> the research made him changed his mind. He was able to reach important conclusions: Bitcoins use as an illicit finance tool is significantly overstated which fiat currency is used for Illicit or Crime than cryptocurrency Link to the PDF file of the investigation information.Source

Ok, that's intersting and all but can you please stick to the press guidelines before posting? Can you edit your thread title to include both the date and the source like everyone else does? Thanks On the report per s, I don't know if that's good or bad, certainly shows how the naysayers bluff when they say bitcoin is used by criminals.

### Reply 2:
Not to be a downer or anything -- I'm as cautious with the good as I am with the bad, when it comes to experts from that part of the political agenda.Also, don't think he actually proved anything, just found a lot of evidence that contradicts past <truncated> from people on his side of the fence. And hasn't it been old news since at least Silk Road and including data from Chainalysis (which CIA or FBI uses, can't recall) as early as 2016 that Bitcoin's use in illicit activities is just really, really low, and keeps getting lower? Edit: the very same ""less than 1%"" data from Chainalysis is referenced in this report.Still pretty interesting though!

Topic: PSA: Bitcoin needs you
### Original post:
The huge run-up in price poses a subtle but very significant threat to Bitcoin. As price went from 9 to 90 two things happened: a lot of media coverage which has attracted a lot of newb users on one hand, and some divestment of old blood looking to buy that new <truncated> on the other.This fundamentally alters the landscape: the new people mean well but mostly don't understand Bitcoin - much like the Endless September folks didn't understand the Internet. They don't know the history, they have at best a tenuous grasp on finance, they don't have at the ready the skills required for Bitcoin survival. They're lambs to the slaughter pretty much.Along with them we've seen a flood of scum - like this, this, this and like probably thousands more, simply looking to fleece the noobs. Much like flies follow any herd of ruminants, scammers will follow the retail user anywhere. They've followed them here, they're getting ready to set up shop and they're going to try and take over the show. Bitcoin is open and decentralized. This means you can't wait for the state to keep them in check.There's no state in Bitcoin. The only authority is you, and Bitcoin's safety depends upon you exercising that<rest of post truncated>

Voting using bitcoin I think this would solve the problem of anonymity.A central system would generate as many cryptographic pairs as the number of voters for the required votation, then pick them randomly, encrypt them and email them using PGP, that each voter could decrypt to get to know his pair.The computer would make the private keys of the pairs generated public after the voting to avoid rewarding loved votes being of any use and each bitcoin address for voting would be listed publicly in order to accept/confirm the votes.Moreover, if you wanted to use a somehow sophisticate direct democracy voting system, you could have a set of <truncated> with radio buttons to choose from, and in the end a number would be generated corresponding to your solution to the radio button voting survey. You would send that number as satoshis, and just after sending the vote, sending the difference to make the balance zero.The addresses would be pre-loaded so that you didn't have to worry with loading them. For your vote to be valid you would have to send the difference after voting so that your bitcoin address balance would be zero in the end, and that address was made useless/safe-less after the<rest of post truncated>

Definitely not the end. We are just at the beginning... That's why we have discussions on how to improve If we were at the end, most of the rough edges would probably already be treated

### Reply 2:
This will not be the end of Bitcoin and it will for sure not be the last drama we'll have. We are bound to encounter more speedbump is the road ahead as bitcoin evolves and adapts to circumstances.I know that for many, me included, this whole drama going on now might not be nice and it might make many negative towards the future of bitcoin. However, just look at what's going on the fiat environment and then consider that it has been around for decades in its current form. Its a complete mess, or maybe I should rather say complete chaos.What bitcoin is going through now is nothing compared to the fiat system which is bordering on collapse.

Topic: OpenCore has a open-soruce SHA core...
### Original post:
I was browsing OpenCores.org and saw that they have an open-source GPL SHA crypto cores:You can download it here. I'm thinking that it would be cool if someone put this on an FPGA (or even fabricated it) and have it set to constantly generate SHA hashes to find bitcoins . Probably wouldn't be as fast as a TESLA running CUDA bitcoin generation, but the idea of having a dedicated bitcoin generator piece of hardware sounded cool to me .Anyone have an FPGA and want to try this out?(update: here's another free crypto core - Nugroho Free Hash Cores (NFHC) currently support SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512 from FIPS-180 standard.)

### Reply 1:
Problem for me is, I've got the hardware and software(got it to try this) but haven't been good enough with VHDL to figure out how to interface it between that and Bitcoin.

### Reply 2:
I don't have an FPGA, or else I would do it myself...I'd like to see what type of results other people get...On a related note, the recently released (Sept 20, 2010) Sparc T3 chip has 16 cores, each with a hardware cryptographic accelerator and 8 hardware threads per core... I'm wondering how many Hashes/Sec you could get out of a T3 Server . (on another related note, it is too bad that since Oracle bought Sun, now all their stuff is closed-source...the Sparc T1 and T2 were open-sourced GPL...)

Topic: The ""test"".. results, opinions
### Original post:
Sending BTC for a small fee currently takes hours.My issue with the 8MB blocksize however is with cheap fees what stops someone from just spamming the shit out of it at 8mb.. 16.. 32.. etc.. Which would cause huge problems for nodes.. at 32mb the blockchain would explode in size if it was being spammed constantly. Even 8 would bloat it pretty quick. Thus not really solving the problem at all...I think this proves just jumping to 20mB blocks could be quite damaging as a 200gig Blockchain would decimate decentralization. Anyone have any other ideas on fixing this issue? I currently do not... :S.. Perhaps the answer is keep it at 1mB blocks.. and it costs a decent amount to send BTC as it is the most secure network on the planet... so it would be used to move large amounts of wealth and store large amounts of wealth. Something like bitshares or altcoins would be spending currency..

### Reply 1:
exactly, i really think that yes or yes we will need to increase the block size, everybody know it the question is why they didnt decide a good solution about it? is not good about why they disagree between them.about pay more fee to have faster transactions havent sense for me too, what we need is to made things going faster without paying more than we are doing now, this will be the real solution, bitcoin is not a bank who charges you for everything, we should never forget it.

### Reply 2:
Correct you dont want new comers to actually experience this type of event because they could feel a bit overwhelm yes cost will still be low but no everyone would be able to to have a full bitcoin experience is their transactions are taking 3 to 8 hours to confirm, an obvious bigger blog would needed in order to overcome possible transaction traffic and a normal bitcoin experience.I actually had a few people ask me if bitcoin was broken because their transactions where pending for hours.

I hope these spam will be no more disturb the common user and we will once again experiencing fast and low fee <truncated> Luke Dashjr tweet

### Reply 1:
I do not think that the miners would agree to this proposal as they have seen a good increase in their revenue.Why would anyone try to reduce their earnings when they know they are making good money before halving? I agree that Ordinals and Inscription are spamming the network but if miners are happy nothing can be done about them. I feel it is the time when there should be another fork of the Bitcoin blockchain.

### Reply 2:
The Lightening Network has really shown to be a successful Alternative, Since it enables users to establish channels between parties and carry out transactions off-chain without having to wait for confirmations on the Bitcoin network, . In this way, you avoid paying expensive transaction fees and also avoid having to wait a long time for your transactions to be confirmed on the network. It is undoubtedly a pretty great alternative for dealing with the issue of excessive TX fees.

Topic: BitCoin in the local economy
### Original post:
Understanding only the rudiments of the BC Protocol and almost nothing of programming I don't know if my idea is feasible. And if so, if it is worthy.It would require that the BC Protocol have some facility to track the location of transfers in some manner similar to the way it tracks the history of transfers via the blockchain.Then it could be known if a BC was spent within, say, twenty miles of where it was received. Then such a locally spent BC could be designed to receive a premium on purchasing power. Then a local economy could be given a boost to be self-supporting and thrive.This must be what is meant by a trade barrier. I don't have much understanding of finance either and I DO know that this is sketchier than a dream but I wanted to just throw the idea out there or for those who could pick it up.

### Reply 1:
It would hurt the privacy and will be misleading and would open space to abuse and injustices.There is no easy way to tell exactly where each transaction came from, for all transactions in general, even without proxies there still will be room for errors, as far I know

### Reply 2:
Thanks everyone for the feedback. In hindsight I wasn't so much wanting to alter the BCP to facilitate an alternate economy but in recognizing that an economy confined to a specific locale is socially superior to a global one I was wondering if the BCP could assist in that. And I think franky1 came closest to addressing this. But by ""specific locale"" I don't mean a specific business, I mean a specific geographic place. An economy confined to a specific locale is socially superior because it encourages neighbors to interact whereas Apple and Amazon and even Starbucks are, the fantasy notwithstanding, about getting you to spend your money with them. If money had more value if it stayed close to home perhaps the world would feel less alien. I think this is expressed, for example, in the widening longing for farmer's markets. The closest I've come to effecting this was the idea for a local restaurant to offer a discount for patrons showing a driver's license with a local zip code. It seemed that as long as this technology is still in its nascent state we could up the ante and develop it to foster not just a monetary expedient but a broader social one as well. But this may be a bit tang<rest of post truncated>

Topic: Bitcoin - Store of Value or Method of Payment
### Original post:
I've recently meditated on this thought. We all want businesses to adopt bitcoin as a payment method and people to pay with it, but I think most people are rather avoiding to spend their BTC as they see it more as a store of value that will bring wealth to them over the next years. So they are more likely to keep their BTCs and spend the fiat currency, thus the use of BTC in day-to-day transactions won't probably go up until people actually get their wages in Bitcoin denomination. But in order for companies to enable that so it will be convenient for both the employee and the employer we need to have the infrastructure in place, including regulations and major stores in the cities accepting BTC.What's your thoughts on this? Do people prefer to spend their BTC or do anything( maybe even taking a loan) to protect them?

### Reply 1:
With all this price volatility,bitcoin is just ""digital gold"".Remove the price volatility and bitcoin will become a major retail payment tool.

### Reply 2:
It is absolutely both, BUT...bitcoin always has been more of an investment (not necessarily a store of value, since its so volatile) than a form of money. Just look at all the threads and posts on bitcointalk. Most of them are not asking about how bitcoin can be spent or what wonderful things members have purchased with it. They're all about price predictions, TA, and how to buy bitcoin. That ought to paint a picture that answers op's question.Bitcoin is never going to be a good payment method until its volatility decreases drastically. It also will never get used for that purpose unless businesses start accepting it from their customers. Even then I think people will still want to just hold it in the hopes that they'll make a profit. That mindset is very well ingrained in bitcoiners right now.

### Original post:
hey guys,did you hear about this news?<link> and what impact do you think this will have? also what do you expect from future ""exits""? How many of them will ask their price in BTC? Also, what do you think about the volatility aspect of BTC when talking about big exits? For example, maybe a company that is asking for payment to be done with BTC buys a lot of Bitcoins and jumps the price in order to get a good deal, and vise versa...Let's talk Bitcoin startups/exits:)

That's just Voorhees realizing too late that Internet gambling is illegal in the USA and that by telling US customers to go away the business will not be as profitable as it once was. It's a double edged sword and he was holding the handle. If you hope US customers don't stop gambling at your site then you're a criminal. If you really block them then you're no longer as profitable because all the really diseased gamblers were from the US. I said in a post long ago that no matter what happens with Bitcoin, succeed or fail, Voorhees will be rich. Time to retire off shore with all your wealth Erik. At least until the statute of limitations runs out. lol<link> hope he's paying taxes as a US citizen on that windfall.

That's what CSW and his lawyer could do at this moment because they know that they do not have any proof. I haven't watched anything and don't know where to check how CSW was lookin like. Bu his lawyer seems like helpless when he was using craig's autism and his suicidal attempts as an excuse. LOL. Who know's what this person want? What would be his benefit if people accept his as satoshi as he do not have the access to anything (like old bitcoin on old addresses). Maybe he would be sucessfully able to scam people by start selling shitcoins?

### Original post:
Guys I know that there are previous posts and polls regarding the highly suggested source of bitcoin but things always change do I want to know what is the current best source of bitcoin nowadays. Please participate on this poll and kindly tell us why that's your choice. Thanks in advance and God bless us more

### Reply 1:
I have voted for trading as trading is the only way from which you can earn using your experience and skill all other require a lot of luck as well as you need to trust others by investing into any of the HYIP, revshare and cloud mining. And almost all of those services will run away after some time for sure.Trading is best source of bitcoin nowadays and it may remain as best source of earning/multiplying bitcoin in future too.

### Reply 2:
Besides all other I consider that trading is a powerful source to generate bitcoin if done right but is very time consuming.You have to be very active on exchanges and read the mostly every news for the coin you are trading and explore more and more way to earn bitcoins.For other sources I think it doesn't worth trying because it's many times proved that gambling, cloud minings etc are not worth.

Topic: Libertopia Bitcoin Report
### Original post:
Lot's of buzz around bitcoin this weekend at Libertopia 2012 San Diego. Trace Mayer gave an excellent talk and scolded registrants who paid their registration fee with credit cards at such an anti-state gathering. ""Now you're really on the list"" is basically what he said. Good discussions on crypto-currencies with an excellent presentation on the potential of Open Transactions when stacked on top of bitcoin. If attendees hadn't heard about bitcoin before this weekend they sure did now. It's becoming very apparent to freedom-seekers that bitcoin solves many problems and I can sense a ""tipping point"" coming.Jonathan Logan and Frank Braun also gave excellent presentations on Bitcoin, Agorism and Tradecraft. There was a great speech by Doug Casey as well (although he didn't mention bitcoin):<link> When listening to Casey's speech again, he basically points out all of the problems that bitcoin helps solve.

### Reply 1:
thanks for letting us know, Steve.

### Reply 2:
Thanks for the pointer, that was a very entertaining talk by Doug Casey. I like his definition of stupidity as ""an unwitting tendency to self-destruction"", an affliction that is dooming the future living standards of boobus Americanus.For all Casey fans, you can find tons of great, more or less weekly interviews with him in the Conversations with Casey archives. Straight talk on current events and life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

Topic: Bitcoin Cloud Storage and Services
### Original post:
I will point out that I don't know if anyone has brought this idea up. So forgive me if I missed something, and just point me to the discussion.Has anyone thought of building a distributed network for cloud storage (media lockers, etc)? The nodes could be paid in BTC, so participants could join just to get a return on making storage available. Data could be distributed over many systems for every fast access, and back ups.Am I missing something? Most cloud services charge about 50 to 80 dollars a month per terabyte. Seems like there is room for an open sourced, distributed network for data storage. I think it would be cool if people started building cloud machines to run next to their mining hardware....

### Reply 1:
TOR services would be good.The interesting thing about Bitcoin based Cloud services is that they could provide signing as well. If the nodes would provide a directory of hashes, you could prove the timestamp of data you submit to such services.Just another idea.

### Reply 2:
I was wondering if a TOR network that you pay for would work. TOR can be really slow and frustrating. By paying, you would incentivise dedicated TOR nodes in datacentres, which would collect micro payments for data transferred.

Topic: Bitcoin's future is clear to those who study technology's history
### Original post:
In 2010, when asked about the iPad a but after it was introduced to the market, Bill Gates replied Its a nice reader, but theres nothing on the iPad I look at and say, Oh, I wish Microsoft had done it. On May 2013, when asked about Bitcoin, Gates claims it a Techno Tour de force, meaning A feat demonstrating brilliance or mastery in a field.When coming to predict Bitcoins future do we rely on opinions or facts ?The opinions about Bitcoins future vary a lot among so called experts in the fields of investments and technology. For example, on that same interview from May 2013, Charlie Monger calls Bitcoin Rat Poison. So today, instead of listening to experts, I decided to take a look into the history and patterns of new technologies to find out what can we learn from them about the fate of Bitcoin.The world potential market for copying machines is 5000 at most. ~ IBM to the founders of Xerox, 1959Any new technology that is introduced takes time to be adopted by the masses. Anyone who thinks that a new technology is just widely accepted is fooling himself. Here are just a few examples of experts opinion from the past:Television wont last because people will soon get tired of staring at<rest of post truncated>

Wow, great post. You put quite a lot of time into it. What you say is spot on. It is a fact that bitcoin is just NOT SIMPLE. I searched for like an hour for an easy way to buy bitcoins back when they were 50 dollars each, and failed, so didn't buy. Mistake, but oh well. They're just SO HARD to get. So obviously the potential for it's growth is VERY limited (who wants to post on a forum, and obtain an obligatory 4 hours of online time, in order to post in the marketplace to buy bitcoins, I assure you, 99% of the population won't do it).

### Reply 2:
Sorry I disagree. Bitcoin still has negligible users and a tiny total value. We are in the Innovator stage.

Topic: Satoshi Website Triggers Countdown to Live Unveiling of Bitcoin Creator

I don't know what to believe nor what is happening here. I know something but reading makes me wonder if this is true or just a bogus article. Can anyone explain this article? <link>

### Reply 1:
this market is filled with lazy newbies who want to make money but they don't have any ideas for monetization. so what happens in 90% of the times is that they copy other scammers like themselves.when BCash was created and they saw how profitable it was to copy bitcoin and use the name, a wave of similar shitcoins started coming out. we saw more than 100 bitcoin forks!when CW scammed and gained popularity and also made some money by stealing Satoshi's identity everyone else started using the same tactics. this is one of many to come.

### Reply 2:
The identity of Satoshi will forever remain a mystery, The success of bitcoin is not tied to revealing his identity. If he has stayed hidden for 10 years + why now. I don't think there is much substance to this, probably one of those rants by J.McAfee to reveal the Identity of Satoshi. Craig Wright is not an honorable mention.All true lover of bitcoin are the ""satoshi"".Nothing to reveal.

Topic: Interest on Bitcoin
### Original post:
Wondering how many of you earn interest on your Bitcoin?Do you feel this is risky, whoever owns the private key owns the BTC ?Also any resources for a high interest rate I think around 6% is the highest, these are some I have seen Liquity, Blockbank, Voyager, Nexothanks!

### Reply 1:
Too much of a risk, no way will I ever give up ownership of my keys to anybody else. Besides simply HODLING your own bitcoin over 5-10 years will give you way, way more money than any shady interest a company will lay you.Dont do it.

### Reply 2:
Every investment has a certain level of risk. As time goes by, Bitcoin proves to be a safe investment since its 2010. And for those who generate many bitcoins through first Blocks, what risk they would get by holding those bitcoins for any period time as al of them got profit whatever the time he sold. And at first time he only used his computer cpu, means no investment was made then he shouldn't talk about risk.Time changes and block reward becomes less, but it's still not that difficult to calculate the benefit over medium and short terms.For those who bought bitcoin as investment, i guess some of them maybe lost a part of his initial capital if he sold during the Bear market .

Topic: A guy inherits 21 BTC ...
### Original post:
A guy inherits 21 BTC as a collection of numerous legacy addresses on an obsolete USB hardware wallet with no screen. The wallet is no longer supported but still works with the original Windows software I/F. The coins are accessible. He also has the private key (not seed words) both in written form and as .pdf on microSD.He wants to send the coins to a modern HW wallet to secure them properly asap. This will be for long-term cold storage, not for spending anytime soon.Should he:Move them on-chain (to Segwit or bech32 addresses)? Lump sum transfer or send in smaller (what size) increments? Restore the private key to a new HW wallet?Spread over more than one new HW wallet? Which wallet/s?Best practices in this scenario? Practical suggestions? Hints, tips, and pitfall warnings? What would YOU do to best protect this Bitcoin?

### Reply 1:
'He' might like to read and implement the Glacier Protocol - <link>

### Reply 2:
For secure the coin, I will suggest you don't use any kind of protocol except electrum wallet or other reputable bitcoin wallet but there is no need to access the real wallet since he know the genuine private keys.Download the electrum wallet as said by Royse777 verify it, sweep private keys, use Download Mycelium where you can easily import the private keys or Bitcoin core.However, he will need to claim his BCH, BSV etc.

I guarantee remaining life for XRP is 2 years before it collapse.

### Reply 2:
collapse is a sentence for the layman, we usually call it 'market correction'...Since you are in the crypto world please use the word 'market correction' for any asset that is experiencing a price decline when the bulls are high. 'market corrections' are natural. btw, I don't like centralized coins like ripple.

Why wouldn't you think that a doctor practicing without a licence will have that position threatened by a police state? The regulation is there for a reason; to protect the consumer from being able to buy competitive healthcare. It does zero to protect them from unscrupulous doctors.If a license for anything improves the behaviour and motivations of those that are deemed by a state to need one, then it is only in the acquiring and maintenance of the license. If you could magically make the process of getting and keeping the license the exact same thing as behaving responsibly while using it, then the arguments in favor would make sense. What we all live under is simply a thinly veiled protection racket.

Exactly, people are too careless and don't have in mind security. Wallets and cryptocurrency in general are so vulnerable and we have to be very careful what we install, what data we share and especialy we shouldn't give out our private keys. If you don't act like that don't be surprised if one day you lose your coins.

The peasants and slaves will always resent the lords and masters. What we have today is a situation wherein millions of peasants are collectively waking up to the fact that they are not free. The anger and righteous indignation you see on display here is the natural consequence of mass disillusionment. It's all just a little bit of history repeating, cycles upon cycles.

Topic: Ordinary computers can beat Googles quantum computer after all
### Original post:
....Finally we have some honest commentary on false claims of quantum computers posing a legitimate threat to encryption standards cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are built upon. They admit their ""quantum technology"" was based around a loophole, rather than computational advantages. This acknowledgement voids their later claims that future quantum computers will fare better. I think the issue with quantum computers is they lack basic foundational building blocks necessary to deliver on promises of fundamentally superior processing power. There is no quantum breakthrough analogy to the silicon transistor. Which would allow for a quantum computer to be built using basic blocks which are intrinsically superior to silicon semiconductors. Basic logic gates made of silicon will always be superior to the existing logic gates of quantum computing. Unless a significant breakthrough occurs that basic fact will not change.

### Reply 1:
This reminds me of a comment I had made here, back in 2019:<link>

### Reply 2:
One day, when commercial quantum computers actually hit the market, we are going to look back at these races and cringe how slow they all were, like the lemming DEC Alpha vs. i386 vs. SPARC speed races back in the day.

Topic: The world after the last bitcoin is mined
### Original post:
Imagine the future world when the last bitcoin is mined. Do you think bitcoin will stay decentralized or the supply will be somehow controlled and accumulated among governments and banks?

### Reply 1:
Bitcoin is only a program that is created by the developers, so we are not 100% sure if Bitcoin will stay decentralized over the course of its existence. As much as we hope that Bitcoin will stay decentralized, we are not sure what the future developers will implement. If the consensus of the developers finds that centralizing Bitcoin will benefit its ecosystem there is no telling what they may implement in the future. Let us just hope that Bitcoin stays decentralized and that developers and supporters will maintain it that way. In short, the word nothing will make Bitcoin to be centralized is just wishful thinking.

When bitcoin is finally fully mined, I don't know if miners will continue to validate Bitcoin transactions or if they switch to mining other altcoins.Certainly, Bitcoin must have an improvement in the source code to bring convenience in the process of using.When governments hold too much Bitcoin, they can be rate manipulated at their disposal. In the future when Bitcoin is fully mined, it will eventually look like gold.

Topic: Review for bitcoin.org FAQ
### Original post:
I have just completed a second draft for a FAQ on bitcoin.org.The result can be previewed live here : ----Edit : After weeks of review, the FAQ is live: <link> Thanks everyone!More reviews will be useful. If you wish to, please leave a comment and concrete suggestions of improvement if you find:- More or less accurate or ambiguous assertions.- Texts that you think are unrelevant.- Sentences that are poorly written or typos.- Missing important informations.--The goal for this FAQ is to remain an accessible, objective and concise informative resource with a special interest about recurring myths and concerns.Once completed and published, it will also be possible to translate this FAQ just like the rest of the website, allowing us to potentially have a good international FAQ.Thanks in advance

### Reply 1:
Quite nice. I've got a suggestion for ""I'd like to learn more. Where can I get help?"" through - when people want to get help, they probably don't want to go through a couple of resources. I suggest linking to #bitcoin's freenode webchat and <truncated> directly.

### Reply 2:
Perhaps integrating the Freenode webchat there could make sense. Though what I appreciated with the idea of linking the community and resources pages, since these pages are aimed to show different communities and websites based on the language of the user reading the FAQ in the future. Also, it gives users more than just one choice in case they don't like IRC for example and prefer live meetups, or then again, if they don't get a satisfying answer on IRC they can try elsewhere.

Topic: Is an hypothetical ""chance"" attack possible?
### Original post:
People discussed that there is an element of ""chance"" or ""luck"" involved in generating a block.So, one day I might generate two blocks while another day I might generate none.Now the network is build around people generating blocks which seals in the transactions etc.And since a double spending attack is possible by 'reversing' the block -- which requires significant CPU time --,is the 'double spending attack' based a bit on chance, or not?If so, then an attacker wouldn't just need half the network, or more.The attacker needs just 40 percent of the network? more or less, right?It all depends on chance if reversing the block has a chance element to it.So I ask my fellow Bitcoiners: Does it?PS: Sorry for being away, I'll be on the forum from now on again!

### Reply 1:
Sure, there are a couple of tables in the back of Satoshi's bitcoin paper that calculate the chances based on what percentage of CPU work you're contributing.

Topic: If the bug doth fit you can't acquit!  Craig Wright's fradulent list of Bitcoins
### Original post:
The latest published expert testimony in the Wright court case are amazing.Wright submitted several lists of the Bitcoin he claims to own to the court.The first was claimed to be a strict over-estimate, submitted because wright claimed that he couldn't determine what coins were his until they were submitted by a bonded courier. This first list was generated by his employ using a list of supposed characteristics of Satoshi's mining provided by Wright (but really plagiarized from old research by bitcoiner that linked together that may have been mined by a single large miner early in Bitcoin's life). The code they used to generate this list had an embarrassing bug and as a result it also included a bunch of other coins matching a complicated additional pattern in addition to the pattern Wright specified. Since this list was supposed to be a conservative list, the fact that the bug added some more didn't seem to be a big deal, but it later became a smoking gun.The other lists were provided months later and wright claimed they were generated years ago (e.g. 2011) and in delivered recently by the mysterious bonded courier. These new lists were strict subsets of the first list: Unsurprisi<rest of post truncated>

Topic: interest in the cryptocurrency
### Original post:
The regulatory landscape, market trends, new blockchain initiatives, significant price changes of well-known cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as adoption by traditional financial institutions or businesses, are some of the common subjects of interest in the cryptocurrency industry.Also Remember:When making investing decisions in the unstable cryptocurrency market, keep in mind to check the veracity of your information sources and to proceed with caution.

### Reply 1:
If you're an interested investor of cryptocurrency, you don't really have to go through all this things mentioned.What you need to do is to study about the crypto market, educate yourself on things you don't know about crypto before now, because if you say you want to make decisions when the market is stable, you may likely wait till eternity, because the market forces are always not static.So do some education on your self and take the bold step of investing in cryptocurrency.

### Reply 2:
you have got a good list of info to take note but i think this is too much especially for a new person. you dont even have to know all this to make money. just be aware of the risks involved and then try to find what will work for you and make a strategy out of it. study the charts it helps alot. so far so good bitcoin and ethereum has been performing well especially after every dip.

Is it possible to create a PGP public key of an Bitcoin Adress?

### Reply 1:
Yes but the key length of a bitcoin public/private key pair is relatively short, so it may not provide as much security.

### Reply 2:
This is entirely possible, as all a Bitcoin address is is a string of numbers. I'm not sure why you would want to do this though.

### Original post:
Are there currently efforts to hunt down (for example) Big Vern, and the guy (Danny?) from Neo and Bee?Just asking...What is the ""proper"" Libertarian view on dark markets that offer bounty hunters/ vigilante justice?You would need a way to be certain the person is guilty, before subjecting them to a ""free market"" justice system.Any thoughts on how those would work in a free society? and/or do they actually exist now?Edit:3/7/16I am not looking to hire someone.There must be a few 'Ancaps' left around here? If there is ever to be a ""free market"" justice system, then how does it work in the real world?

### Reply 1:
If you were certain the person was guilty then that should be good enough for typical <truncated> justice, wouldn't you think? Siccing a hired hitman on a scammer doesn't depend on justice, it depends on how much money you have.And yes they're available, but I would have no idea who to contact specifically. And I'm not sure if there's any effort to track down the Cryptsy scammers. There was a thread about a lawsuit but I haven't been following it.

### Reply 2:
I've seen hitman services in the deep web. Yes they claim they're professionals but on the side note, these may be just scammers who wants your BTCBTCBTC.I doubt there are vigilantes lurking on the deep web. They don't need to. I heard bounty hunting is 'legal' in the US.

### Original post:
What is your best guess?

### Reply 1:
100B? Think before posting. Its 100M(Million). These figures are nothing but numbers and I would be more excited when actual adoption rates grow with time. More and more people continue treating Bitcoin as an asset primarily and currency secondarily which needs to be reversed hopefully in the near future.

### Reply 2:
Some members seem to have issues with numbers, market cap of bitcoin is currently 93,204,061,964 $, and that is billions - and total market cap is 176,558,719,780 $, also billions by data provided on Coinmarketcap. Only 6.8 $ billion is needed for 100 $ billion MC for bitcoin, and although it seems a lot of money, actually is not. Market capitalization of some coin is calculated in a very simple way. You need circulating supply and price, and for 100 $ billion MC of bitcoin price should be at this moment only around 5700$. In short, to add some 6.8 $ billion to bitcoin market cap, price only need to go up 450$.

Topic: some people uneducate about Bitcoins
### Original post:
5 years ago I heard about Bitcoins some feedback are good but some of them are negativeUntill now In my country if you say/discuss about Bitcoins expect that their response are negative.Why does some people always say negative about Bitcoins?1. Lack of knowledge about Bitcoins, uneducate People only saw the negative sides of Bitcoins.2. Some of them say negative feedback because of their experience on some sites about Bitcoins, because now a days Bitcoin are popular but there are many site will scam you if you are spontaneous to invest in not trusted sites.

### Reply 1:
They belong to two types:- People already joined the market, but got scammed or failed into scam projects. So they hate Bitcoin or cypto.- People have never joined the market. They only watched the market, being curious about the market, feel envious when Bitcoin rises too much.They hate because they are not part of the market.Many resources for them to learn. Because they are lazy or hate Bitcoin or don't have belief in Bitcoin, they don't open their mind to learn.In any game, you can not win if you don't lose first. If you win first, but don't sharpen your knowledge, you will lose all later.I did lost money in crypto market but my failures don't make me hate Bitcoin and crypto market. My failures are because of me, not the market so I don't have reasons to hate Bitcoin or the market. I hate myself with past stupid mistakes.

### Reply 2:
On the contrary, people in my country have grown eager to learn about Bitcoin, cryptocurrency in general, because of their perceived benefits. Although there are still negative perspectives about it, its volatility is what have caused these mainly. Nonetheless, people have a rather positive outlook toward Bitcoin it is just that its volatile nature discourages them to push through.

Topic: 4 Bitcoin wrongly bridged
### Original post:
Hi guys, I tried to bridge 4 bitcoins 5 months ago. In this procedure I should have claimed the 4 bitcoins after bridging. Fortunately, I had a power outage at that exact moment, so I was not able to claim the bitcoins on the BSC20.Can someone please help me how to get my 4 bitcoins back? Here is some information for you guys.There I have 4 BTC put in the Vault to bridge via the following address and TxHash:<link> / Transaction / <truncated> Bitcoin (BTC) transaction, value: 4.09994750 BTC, date: <truncated> is the error: BSC address not confirmed, claimed - meaning the BTC should be traceable via smart contract.I am not able to reach out to the Badger Team or RenVM Team.Kind regards

### Reply 1:
You can open a support ticket on the BadgerDAO Discord. <link>

### Reply 2:
You sent your bitcoin to another address not controlled by you, so you can't have them back.If you want to get some help about how to get the altcoin you're expecting, you should post this in the altcoin forum: <link>

Topic: Crypto being way better when it comes to tracking - what we always said
### Original post:
<link> Time and again there has been a feud between Bitcoins supporter and the Government . Government always said how cryptocurrencies are not a good option since they can be used for illegal purposes and therefore should be banned . Twitter hack did steal a lot from people but at the same time the fact that the government was able to track down those people do prove that whatever claims they might make about cryptocurrencies being problematic and used for money laundering and other stuff , they are forgetting the fact that it's so transparent that it can destroy the whole corrupted body itself. Maybe this is the reason why they are scared of the Bitcoins. I do believe through this we learned a few lessons . - how one should be there extra cautious online - how Bitcoins needs to be recognized as a good thing by the government not a competition or be negatively associated.

### Reply 1:
Scam has been existing before cryptocurrencies were created, in this modern time, people still mostly use fiats to scam, even if bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies are banned, scammerw will still always make use of fiats to scam. There are many ways scammers o this successfully in a way they can even not be traceable. In some instances, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are traceable than fiats.

### Reply 2:
They are starting to recognize it as they find the value of it growing back again. They will not ignore it as it's giving the attention of everyone who looks after the price but not what it is.Just like any other payment options that we have in our economy, bitcoin can be an alternative of it. They don't have to look at it as something negative which they can't benefit.

Topic: Bitcoin as a more pronounced and researched Cryptocurrency.
### Original post:
The human race has developed both mentally and otherwise to the extent of making versed research in getting more detailed information about the recent happenings in crypto more expecially Bitcoin and it's possible total adoption, this has over the time help both beginners and old folks in Bitcoin world to know it's benefits and also the right targetted period to invest in it and also the need to promote it as one of the most profit expectant Cryptocurrency. this informations has change the mind set of many to believe that Bitcoin has come to stay as the currency of the future and have to be accepted despite not being a legal tender.Always bitcoin.

### Reply 1:
Definitely it is the currency of the future and with the stereotypes spread around it and how it has come all these years it certainly going to grow in numbers. Do I think there will be total or global adoption of it, I would say No because they are certain things that could limit it. The fact there are people who cant even use the internet is proof that this faction or group arent moving towards it. As the fiat system or government policies continue to dampen peoples hope from saving into bank, more people will seek out the opportunity of having a total financial freedom and that is where bitcoin plays its role. Will bitcoin also become a legal tender? Yes more countries will certainly given to accept it as legal tender, most especially the less developed countries with weak currencies against the top currencies. As this is a way for them to be a pair interms of international transactions and to save them from their devaluing currency. As for the top countries with strong currencies they certainly feel it is a threat to their currency but bitcoin isnt here to replace any currency but rather to act as an alternative to those fiat currencies.

### Reply 2:
People are looking for ways to detach themselves from government manipulation, some people had enough of this government intrusion on their financial aspects and many of them just wants the freedom to transfer their funds without the fear of the government confiscating their money. This is one of the reason why many people are looking to use Bitcoin. Because of its decentralized nature, people's wealth when converted to Bitcoin will gain financial independence from the manipulative grasp of the government.

Topic: A block containing only 2 transactions
### Original post:
I accidentally faced a weird block that contains only 2 transactions. I don't know if there are similar blocks.Check block number 364292<link> are only 2 transactions. One of them is related to new generated coins and there is no issue with it. But the other one:The size is 999657 bytes and what makes me really surprised is the zero fee.

### Reply 1:
As you can see that's an old transaction: 2015-07-07 18:19:07Blocks with only 2 transactions aren't weird at all, but it's hard to see them nowadays.In the past users was able to send transactions with zero fees and isn't hard at all if you know how to create a raw transaction with bitcoin core. But i think nowadays the same software gives a warning if the user doesn't add fees or if it's too low.

### Reply 2:
It makes perfect sense that a user would want to mine this transaction themselves for zero fees, rather than pay a fee and broadcast it for someone else to mine. It has 5569 inputs all of 0.00001 BTC for a total of 0.05569 BTC, and comes in at 999,657 bytes. Even at a fee of 1 sat/byte, the user in question would have lost 0.01 BTC or almost 20% of the transaction value in fees. Looking at the blocks before and after, the average transaction fee at the time was around 60 sat/byte, which would have cost this user 0.6 BTC in fees, or more than 10x more than the transaction was worth.Not in this case. The block was essentially full from this one transaction alone.

Read this article on how Greeks are trying to get money out of banks, and have no safe place to put it! In their home, they risk robberies. Transferring it to other places, takes high fees back and forth. Put it in a safety deposit box, and it's only slightly safer than being in one's account... plus all the safety deposit boxes are taken already.OR you could use Bitcoin and keep it perfectly safe on a USB drive! How do we tell Greece to wake the hell up?<link>

But before Our Favorite Son asked Big Ben a question, he reached into his pocket and produced a silver coin. Barney's eye lit up, hoping all the while it's going to be flipped, giving him the pleasure on calling 'heads', but would settle for Herb's tail.

Topic: A few questions
### Original post:
Is it possible to know when I will get newly minted bitcoins from my processing? I've been generating for a few weeks now and haven't seen any. Does everyone get new bitcoins at once? I have read about backing up your wallet.dat file but not much about restoring from backups - do you simply install Bitcoin and then write over the wallet.dat with your archived version of wallet.dat? If you archive your wallet.dat and then a make a transaction, and say your hard drive crashes and you restore your old wallet.dat from before the last transaction - does this restore everything you had before that transaction? And the last transaction after backing up is then lost forever?Say I reinstall my OS and then reinstall Bitcoin and recover with my old wallet.dat - do I keep my progress I had made minting my next bitcoins, or do I have to start over from the beginning?Is it conceivable to have a Bitcoin smartphone app, so you could make in-person trades and verify that they have paid you?

### Reply 1:
you can not be in the start or in the middle of generating bitcoins. I think you should read FAQ more carefully

### Reply 2:
This is being worked on, but everything is at an early stage.

Topic: Did I just lose my wallet?
### Original post:
My computer crashed but I had my bitcoin address and password in my password manager so I thought I was good. I installed the Bitcoin core app again, but can't figure out how to open my existing wallet and realized the password I have isn't the seed-like sequence of words I thought it was. Am I screwed?

### Reply 1:
We had a different name on that but the same meaning, that is a mnemonic phrase, or they called the 12 words seeds phrase or must be known in the name of a private key. Upon creation of a wallet, you must write it down on a sheet of paper to have a backup of your wallet anytime even your computer used was crashed or damage. So now, without the private key, you can't able to open your wallet, it should have a password and the private key must be kept safe.Try to explore on this board, Beginners & Help, there's basic information regarding Bitcoin wallet there on how to create and how to recover your wallet through your private key or seed phrase.Anyway, welcome to the Bitcointalk forum, here, you will learn a lot, and next time you were handling Bitcoin with proper knowledge of storing your crypto, a digital asset.

### Reply 2:
I am assuming you re-installed your operating system? A couple Qs. I think we will be able to help better if we have clarity on these.Do you recall ever creating a backup of your ""wallet.dat"" file?Are you still using the same hard drive?And what did you choose as your data directory when you installed Bitcoin Core last time? Did you keep it as default (%APPDATA%\Bitcoin) or choose a different drive/location. Your ""wallet.dat"" file can usually be found in that directory. Assuming you didn't create a backup previously nor can find the old ""wallet.dat"" in your hard drive then it would be a little tougher. All hope is not lost though, because if you're using the same hard drive then with some luck you might be able to recover the old ""wallet.dat"" file with a data recovery tool.

### Reply 1:
Thanks for replying, I think it's a scam, but is it technically feasable?

### Reply 2:
Could you elaborate on who is asking you to do this? It sounds like a scam, but it also depends on the amount. If you want to withdraw 1 BTC and they ask you to deposit a minimum of 0.0001 BTC it doesn't sound so bad, depending on who is asking you. If it's something you've supposedly ""won"" like a lottery prize, it's a scam, and there have been a number of them around here recently.

Topic: Central Bank digital currencies
### Original post:
Why do you think Central banks around the world are rushing to develop their own digital currencies? Is it a threat to bitcoin?

### Reply 1:
They need a faster way to transfer the money to their citizens is one of the biggest reason for developing their own digital currencies. Other nefarious possibility is for them to control their citizens although this is just a wild speculation and it is still far from true. The good thing about CBDC is that it alleviate inflation due to continuous print of fiat currency.

### Reply 2:
Some things to consider: CBDCs specifications complement the need for control and easier access to alteration on money supply to stimulate the economy. Due to its existence within the digital realm (or whatever), it is easier to keep track of it and store it, making the government's job a lot easier for taxation and legal purposes. It's the new fad. They might just get into it before other people can and capitalize this 'innovation' for their popularity within their constituents for a re-election or something.There are tons of reasons why they want to push through with CBDCs, and there are also countless of threads that tackle just that. These things above are just some of those I can think off the top of my head.

Topic: Bitcoin, an opening to incentivize opportunity for the use of renewable energy
### Original post:
Bitcoin, an opening to incentivize opportunity for the use of renewable energy, this is coming in as an explanation on the use of bitcoin mining in providing a lasting solution to the environmental degredation, harzard and toxics release to the environmen while with the use of renewable energy to lessen the increasing electricity cost across mining rigs, the United States will definitely comes out plain with their take on bitcoin adoption with time at last, let's dive into the real scene in proper from the official statement captured below. source

### Reply 1:
Forcing crypto mining farms to have adaption to become more environmental friendly is good and is a thing should be done.However, if accusing that crypto mining industry is the main or one of main causes of global warming and climate change, that is absolutely not true. According to stats from Bitcoin mining council, you can easily see that the total electricity consumed by Bitcoin mining is smaller than other industries. More impressively, Bitcoin mining industry uses more renewable energy resources than other industries and all the world.It's 59.5% sustainable in Q2 2022 (take from the source below)Q2 2022 Bitcoin Mining Council survey confirms year on year improvements in sustainable power mix and technological efficiencyWatch more on Youtube for result discussion: <link>

### Reply 2:
Is there not limitations to this?It's extra money for energy generating companies but the mining might be sporadic and I don't know how well that'll work for both the miners and the energy firms running them (and the network as a whole) - I guess it's possible waste energy can be estimated and battery systems could be set up to take the energy and use it for the miners to keep them running instead though (I don't know if batteries feeding back to the grid is a good idea as you'd still end up with surplus power that could be used for crypto mining or other oporstuons - like data mining or offering companies slightly cheaper rates for running appliances at that time).

### Original post:
Hello Guys ! I find an old file .key from multibit that i used a long time ago. The file is encrypted and i try to put in multibit software but doesn't work ! I don't remember if i use a password but when i used multibit i just open the software and used it..I think when i use the software for payment, there is a creation of file.key ?? and it is automatically encrypted ? i'm not sure of the functioningSomebody have an idea to decrypt .key file ? and a procedure to do it ? Thanks brothers !

### Reply 1:
To follow on from NeuroticFish's comment:If the file is encrypted, then you can decrypt it via OpenSSL. The instructions for doing so are here: <link> command you need to run is:Code:openssl enc -d -p -aes-256-cbc -a -in \<ciphertext file\> -out \<plaintext file\> -pass pass:\<password\>If it is encrypted and you cannot remember the password, then you can use btcrecover to attempt to bruteforce it if you have a vague idea of what it might be: <link>

### Reply 2:
Make a copy of the key file and open it with a text editor (notepad?)In the file ignore the lines that start with #.If you have at least one line that looks <truncated> <truncated> <truncated> another chars instead of x) then you're good, you can import the private key into Electrum.Please don't post it anywhere online.If the file looks different, i.e. it starts with U2F, then it's encrypted and you need to remember your password (and if you don't remember it then you have a problem).If it's not password protected, you can import it into Electrum as <truncated> sure you've got Electrum from electrum.org and verified it too.)

This mostly shows the poor conditions in what people there work, seeking only profits from mining at all costs. Its so dirty and built as an abandonedwarehouse, dont see what tech advancement you see there. btw made in china mostly means garbage, 99% of the time.As far as VR devices go, you dont need one to take advantage of VR videos, just use your mouse to look around all the angles, as you would on google street view.

Topic: A question to people who have been hodling their Bitcoins since early days
### Original post:
Any person would sell their stash at few 'x', what factors made you keep holding it?

### Reply 1:
There is probably a realization that comes with experiencing multiple market cycles which I consider to be an important factor. Early Bitcoin holders most likely sold some of their stash very early on, but with time realized the worth and the growth pattern and as such tightened their grip on their holdings. Newer investors look at the chart, while earlier ones experienced those bull and bear cycles.I would say; Understanding of the fundamentals; Knowing how valuable an asset is makes it easier to hold it when you consider it to be undervalued. Having an investment plan; planning what amount you hold based on how much you can spare and balancing your investment and fiat stash is an important factor, as you are less likely to panic sell. Building resolve; I have experienced one bear cycle and imo, that builds your resolve for the future and makes it easier to hodl. Finding ways to use Bitcoin as it is(merchants and outlets which accepts it) means you never really need to flip it inorder to spend a bit.

### Reply 2:
It's pretty obvious that you are having any second thoughts in selling your holding due to its current price I presume.Well, perhaps one of the reason why I still keep holding bitcoin in my pocket is that somehow I believed that these institutional investors who are discreetly buying bitcoin and accumulating as much as they can from retails traders and and exchange companies like coinbase and I am certain that they are doing it for the long haul. However, If it turns out that they are selling tons of bitcoin then it would be a good opportunity to buy at a cheaper price.Just want to share this quote from Eric Peters

Topic: Application to manage users, wallet, and to audit
### Original post:
Right now it is very easy for single users to use bitcoin. It is easy to deploy on a single computer and accept and send payments. For a medium or large business, however, it might be a little risky to allow a single person to control the bitcoin application.That is why I am proposing maybe we could develop an application around bitcoin that supports multiple users to manage a wallet so there is an ability to audit user transactions. The wallet must be secure from the users except maybe from a 'superuser'. The application also needs to have the ability to automatically backup the wallet without exposing the wallet.One of my other concerns is that it is very hard to accept automated payments from a website. Every thing has to be manual, for instance, I need to manually generate a payment key if I want someone to pay me. This is great for bartering but we need to take it to the next level and make it automatic and make sending and receiving payments instant.Scalability is another issue. As a website grows the application needs to scale with the number of users.Anyone up for this? I might be...

### Reply 1:
I agree that better bitcoin support for merchants is necessary. I like this idea. Merchants will want to see it integrated with accounting somehow. At a minimum small businesses have receipts and can go through them at the end of the day, but since this is all online a much more efficient integration is possible. We need it for merchants to adopt this. It ought be <truncated> than the other systems to really get good traction.

### Reply 2:
Bitcoin has the ability to support non-standard transactions; this has so far been disabled in the official client.You could for example design a non-standard transaction that must be signed by two people before it makes it into a block.Then all you have to do is give two trustworthy people in your business a private key each and make sure they keep that key safe.Using the block chain directly is a much safer option IMO than building another layer of security software on top of Bitcoin. The more complexity, the more potential security holes.

Topic: Why do we need a bull market blow off top ?
### Original post:
As you know everyone is looking the final blow of top for the bitcoin bull market like it happened in 2017. I have a serious question that why we need a big blow off top to conclude the bull market and enter a bear market.Consider for a moment that Bitcoin prices moves to all time high of around 130,000$ and then in the next week we are at 90,000$ and then slowly we moved towards 30,000$. Why everyone wants this blow off top ?Why can't bitcoin stay between 40K to 60K and slowly moves towards 100,000K taking 6 to 8 months and no bear market. Wouldn't it be good for everyone?

### Reply 1:
Technically that is a bull market. If it keeps going up it's bull, if it keeps going down it's bear.What we don't want as people in it for the long term are rapid jumps in both directions. That just makes everyone twitchy. There are a lot of people who react without thinking when the price spikes up or down quickly that is what we don't want.-Dave

### Reply 2:
Whales are called whales since they invest money and trust in bitcoin when it's down and out. How many of us bought bitcoin when it was 1$, 10$ or 100$? There were not many, most of us are busy making fun of bitcoin at that time. It's whales who were busy buying and mining bitcoin on there laptops at that time. These are my few satoshis about whales, now they are manipulating the market which is not liked by small fishes.

Topic: BIP 16/17 poll
### Original post:
I have been casually following the BIP 16/17 issue and I thought that maybe we could use a poll to help assess where the rest of us non-developers and non-voters stand.

### Reply 1:
This poll is totally not helpful. These changes are a huge fundamental change to the bitcoin protocol, and it is a bad idea for people to be treating such a serious topic like a popularity contest.Far better would be if you closed this thread, researched the topic a bit and then make a post with a balanced summary of all the viewpoints. Like this you are encouraging everyone to pick and choose based on social proof or popularity.And I am totally neutral on this topic.

### Reply 2:
This post is in no way meant to trivialize the topic, quite the contrary, I think it is important to gauge the sentiment of the community, especially since the devs cannot seem to agree on the topic and the whole issue is becoming quite contentious and maybe even a little ugly. I do not want to encourage ""popularity contests"" and frankly, I don't think that the results of a silly forum poll won't hold any influence over the decisions of those who are truly involved with the implementation of protocol changes. I do however feel that the vast majority of the community has not been encouraged to participate in the discussion and I think everyone should be at least somewhat active in these matters. Really, I hope to encourage some discussion among the 99% of us here that are not participating in core development, and if there are devs who are passionate and unhappy with the results they see here, perhaps they need to more strongly express their positions to the community in a way that everyone can understand so that we can make the best decision possible and keep everyone informed. I think we all appreciate the hard work that everyone in the development team puts forth and I hope that <rest of post truncated>

Topic: The most trustworthy International Exchange ATM... (Or international retailers).
### Original post:
I was wondering since btc has finally started hitting high prices and some people will start selling their bitcoins in exchange for real money, am pretty damn sure not all exchanges will be ready to Buy your bitcoins at current prices,and it did happen in the past when btc made it as high as 20k usd. So what is ur plans guys and what r some of the most trustworthy International Exchanges where we can sell our BTC ?? Any thoughts on retailers too who accept BTC for payments ??Good luck all !...

### Reply 1:
Maybe that's just your opinion about exchanges or retailers that they won't buy your BTC. I think as long as the exchanges are profiting with fees in different trading pairs/markets that they have, there would be no problem with that. As for retailers, if the owner is a believer in BTC, I think they would be happy to accept it and price it according to BTC price, with that, I think it would be no problem. That's just the problem with some of the people here, and they do not believe completely with BTC. For some, it's only a possibility to profit, not completely adapting to what it could be in the future, where it would be the medium of exchange towards different people and maybe governments. We will see.

### Reply 2:
Bittrex and Binance have proven themselves as some of the best crypto exchanges currently. Binance is returning their lost funds through the SAFU fund proving their reliability.If you are looking for a P2P exchange, I suggest LocalBitcoins. Trade only with high trust traders.

Bitcoin mixers and coin mixers in general are only designed for criminals and are only used for criminals. It's very sad that this forum allows ads from coin mixers. People representing them in their signatures are also supporting criminals. This coin mixers are used to hide transactions made from deals like drugs and child pornography or any other crimes. And nothing else. All the instructions which can be found online are literally telling you how to avoid being trace and hide your money. All those coin mixers are illegal only alone by the fact that they are not even a company or anything. There's no single legal address. They have no financial license. And even all the scam brokers have one. And don't come with things like ""Its also a use case for some poor guy in Iran who has to hide"". That's bullshit. And you know its a lie.Everyone knows it but many don't want to accept it. They are accepting coin mixers because they think there now some rebellious guy.

Bitcoin designed a ""Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"", but peoples using it to scam others. Is that fault goes to the Bitcoin or Bitcoin creator? The mixer has designed to cut the links and receive clean coins, it's mostly using by those who care about privacy. If scammers or hackers using it then really can we blame the mixers? I don't think so. Also, fiat money using for fraud attempts, but we can't blame fiat. Mixers just break the links between transactions. It would be used by criminals or by legit Bitcoin users. The forum doesn't moderate scams, if scammers using bitcoin to scam people then should the forum stop spread the words about Bitcoin. Same about mixers, if it's using by criminals, doesn't necessary to stop advertising here.

### Reply 2:
The argument actually goes the other way round:mixing in general is mainly a necessity because e.g. exchanges are complicit in the criminal act of ""chainalysis"" which is pretty obviously contrary to the privacy rights of e.g. European citizens.Sorry, I've proven you wrong.

Topic: Motley Fool adds Bitcoin to model portfolio *and* buys some too
### Original post:
Online investment advisor and traditional Bitcoin skeptic Motley Fool is adding Bitcoin to its high risk portfolio and even buying $5m for its own balance sheet because:(1) Better than gold(2) Will become more of a medium of exchange when volatility decreases(3) Inflation hedgeThis is big news as any active investor who is not a cryptocurrency purist will read Motley Fool tips at least once a month.Possibly even bigger news is that it advises holding Bitcoin directly instead of through expensive funds or exchange traded products.<link>

### Reply 1:
Absolutely. At first I thought about price manipulation, but I don't think their image could withstand that.They still hate on Bitcoin proxies like Argo Blockchain (up 1800% in a year) because they see them as hype.They see pure Bitcoin itself as a long term investment with a 15 year timeframe.

### Reply 2:
Am I the only one who hasn't heard about the Motley Fool publication before? $5M is not a lot of money in the institutional world, but yet as I see the website provides financial education for the average joe and not only.According to CoinTelegraph article the website has 87 million views/month. That's serious exposure for Bitcoin. If let's say 10% of those views (8.7 million) are unique people that put $500 into BTC that would be $4bn added to BTC market cap. So it's kind of a big deal if you think about it.

Topic: Do you track bulk Bitcoin transactions being carried out by whales?
### Original post:
Do you track bulk Bitcoin transactions being carried out by whales? Do you feel it has good impact on Bitcoin prices and a regular trader can benefit from this data.

### Reply 1:
Tracking bitcoin transactions made by whales is like being the paparazzi and taking photos of celebrities leaving their private residence.It's very rude, and indecent just for making a few extra bucks.Arguably, whale transactions are even dumber to track since they are usually not even trades, so actually the people tracking them and make a trade based on that end up losing money.Respect people's privacy and don't spy on others' transactions.

### Reply 2:
No, I do not.I do not track any transaction at all.No. The only impact it has is on social media where they are posted with the intention of stoking interest from the readers and getting reposts to attract more audience. In truth the purpose of the transaction is unknown and that uncertainty will not change the sentiment of traders.Even if it does have an effect, it will be small and short lasting.

Topic: What to consider for Bitcoin investment?
### Original post:
What factors will you consider for Bitcoin investment? Do you also compare other indexes to check when it is a suitable time to buy in or out for Bitcoin? Like Gold Price? Nasdaq index?

### Reply 1:
Set aside comparing but focus first on why you should consider bitcoin investment.Learn the risks, learn the advantages, learn the disadvantages, and any things that need when starting an investment.While in progress, you will eventually learn the difference between bitcoin to other assets, and from there, you can now make a conclusion if it makes sense to push or continue your crypto investment.

### Reply 2:
Yes it is important. Im more into crypto so I always tend to look on the tech and fundamental aspect when regards to market price. I think that bitcoin is also comparable to other indexes but some people tend to correlate it more on stock market. When stocks are down then they check and review its effect on crypto market of bitcoin, but Im not a guy refers to that. More of marketcap and price valuation based on tech charts and hype news.

Topic: Hillary Clinton: Nation states should pay attention to the rise of crypto
### Original post:
Today is the third day of the New Economy Forum and the speakers for today include Hillary Clinton and Tony Blair. For her part, Clinton made mention of cryptocurrency. She urged that nation states should start paying attention to its rise. I don't know how much the former US presidential candidate and secretary of state knows about cryptocurrency but she is definitely briefed about it. For better or for worse, she interprets crypto-- perhaps she actually meant Bitcoin more than crypto-- as having the potential for undermining not just other less powerful fiat currencies but also the USD itself as the reserve currency. This to me is a sign that the old order has now been seriously shaken to the core. And rather than opposing that which seriously disrupts the old system, something which they cannot stop, it might actually serve them better if they just embrace and exploit it. If the USD is now being threatened and the threat is more or less unstoppable primarily because of its decentralized system, it might be prudent to just welcome the threat and make use of it. What do you think? Will the USD face its eventual demise as a reserve currency due to its own weaknesses and the threat <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Not sure how she's so surprised that bitcoin is a threat to the USD; you know, after they like inflated the USD like hell. Of course people are looking for lifeboats. It's like shooting yourself in the foot then blaming your doctor/surgeon.

### Reply 2:
It might become less profitible for the US government but not being the world reserve currency hasn't done too badly for the other countries that have had the title in the past.I doubt crypto has the strength to overtake the dollar within a few years for example but there will likely be a solution that rises up that <truncated> accept (and we can hope it's not centrally controlled).

Topic: The Stories on Bitcoin's Value
### Original post:
You've all probably heard the stories on Bitcoin's value. Stories that portray Bitcoin not only as valuable, but precious. Stories by which buying bitcoins is one of the smartest things you can do. Well, all of that is just cheap propaganda. A bait to lure you to buy something worthless.Bitcoins cannot be eaten or drunk. They cannot be seen like artwork or heard like music. They cannot be used to operate computers and execute specific tasks like computer software. They cannot be driven like a car or worn like jewelry. In short, bitcoins have no intrinsic value. When you buy them, you only get a short record, e.g. '5.1234 BTC'.If someone issued a record and offered it to the public, they must redeem it. The record has to have redemption value. Casino chips, fiat currencies, shares, or gift cards are examples of such records. When you hold them, all you can see is a short string of characters written on a digital, plastic or paper media. There is nothing intrinsically valuable to consume or utilize. That's why their issuers must redeem them for something.Casinos redeem their chips for cash. Banks redeem their currencies for debt servicing and liens release. Namely, the units of fiat <rest of post truncated>

Are there any suggestions as to how many individual people are approximately using Bitcoin / have used Bitcoin in total?This is really interesting in my opinion. How many people have tried this beautiful piece of technology at their own fingertips?

I've seen a couple of other threads with a similar question, it is something that a lot of us would like to know. How you would determine unique users is something that appears to be a stumbling block, a wallet address is no good and even this forum not every user would have come here and even then you can have multiple usernames, it will be interesting to see if someone figures out a way this can be done.

Thanks to Elwar and CIYAM Pty. Ltd., I'll safely assume that this is doable.The idea I have in mind will be introduced elsewhere, but I do want to say here that it will consist of a popularity contest, where the number of people voting is not tallied, only the amount of coins, with anybody voting as much and as often as they want, with each week the starting number of contestants is halved till we have a winner. (64 or 126 contestants is what I'm currently leaning toward)The grand prize has to big enough to get maximum participants, say like $1M USD. I'm also looking at a 50/50 split. 50% of the total pool as a grand prize to the winner, and the other 50% split among all those who enter the contest (not the voters, though they could be one and the same) divvied up accordingly to their respected ranking, therefore even the contestant in last past is guaranteed something provided, of course, coins were voted for them.Rest assure, that if/when this comes to fruition, I will not be in control of, nor have access to, the pool.Again, this thread is just a preliminary step to make sure that such a voting option was available/doable.

Topic: Bitcoin is ""dying"".
### Original post:
Hello everyone. I don't want to sound pessimistic, but it looks like bitcoins ideas are dying.I spend a week on this forum talking with people about Bitcoin and asking their opinions in threads. And I came to the conclusion that the whole idea of Bitcoin is being killed in front of our eyes. The problem is that most of the people in crypto see Bitcoin as an asset like a stock to invest in and then sell later. No one even thinking about the future of Bitcoin as means of currency. Bitcoin was created NOT as an asset, we use it as one, it was created to solve a banking problem and create money of freedom that can't be faked and printed. And somehow people are literally forgotten about this whole point of Bitcoin. I created a thread asking people what they think bitcoin will stabilize enough to become a currency for people to use and literally everyone said to me that it's an asset and it will never stabilize. And, don't get me wrong, sounds logical and I agree with that. But if we treat Bitcoin like this, why are we waiting for the ""mass adoption"" and want businesses to accept Bitcoin that is not stable in any means to use it as a currency?Another big problem is that everything in cry<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
If that's what you think, so be it. But it doesn't mean that if you're thinking that it's like that and Bitcoin is dying, it really does. We've got a lot of people that are optimistic with Bitcoin's future and if you don't like people owning Bitcoin because they see it as a store of value and will just eventually be sold later on, that's fine. We've got different purposes and desires why we are holding Bitcoin. The idea of Bitcoin being a future payment and currency isn't being removed and gone. You're just noticing that there's a division for those people that likes it as an investment instead of a payment method. But you need to realize that neither of those are being gone, Bitcoin is still being used as payment by many and we're all optimistic of its future. And as for these KYC, it's these companies jurisdiction and responsibility to do it because they're being required by the government. Do not forget that we've got options to opt-in whether you want to use a service or not.

### Reply 2:
Just because you couldn't find a good platform, to sell your crypto shouldn't bring you to a conclusion that Bitcoin is centralized, like how is that even possible.Since you are already a senior member of this forum, I will assume that you should already be familiar with many other decentralized and peer to peer platforms that doesn't require any kyc verification from you before you use their services. Why worry your self too much over kyc verification platforms why you can just do everything without passing through all that stress. As for the ledger or any other platform that would bring the idea of storing the seed phrase in the cloud, I don't think that most people will queue into that idea because the cloud storage can be attacked at anytime, putting everybody's funds at risk. Just stay positive on Bitcoin, it's growing and in no time, it will reach its full potential and which is to serve as an alternative to the store of value (fiat)

You have to create a personal page for yourself from the beginning. Write all your work, which I also sell in digital currencies, so that if anyone wants to buy it with Bitcoin, they can find out.The second point is that you do not know about the digital world and this is unfortunate, but do not worry too much Sabrina.I suggest you visit YouTube .......

I just read the rules for selling. But I don't understand. Here there are only people selling stuff about cryptocurrency. I have painting and sculpture.

So, this is why I am thinking also if it is possible for the bitcoin family especially to Satoshi Nakamoto to give love and share gifts through bitcoin.Although we know that the account under Satoshi Nakamoto with silver coins below his account name is no longer active but with the slightest hope and possiblities that he could show up. I was thinking of possible reason with how possible that Satoshi Nakamoto will show up and these are the following.Possible reason for Satoshi Nakamoto to show up,1. It is christmas and time for giving off message, love and gifts.2. This year 2020 is not really a good year due to pandemic. There are lot of challenges specifically in financial aspects. Many individuals around the world has lost their jobs usually the low income earners. 3.

### Reply 1:
Satoshi created bitcoin to be completely decentralized in a way he himself or they themselves remained pseudonymous since 10 years ago. With what people are thinking, Satoshi's work has been completed to create bitcoin and was successfully created. Satoshi's work is not to give people bitcoin. But, people that like and wants to give bitcoin can give it. Just see bitcoin as an asset and a real money with intrinsic value. So far commodities like gold can be given by anyone while fiat can also be given by anyone, also bitcoin can be given by anyone. No need to centralize this on Satoshi Nakamoto. Although, he created bitcoin but not the owner of bitcoin. People should also be careful of scammers, because there is nothing scammers can not do to steal bitcoin from someone, for example during free giveaways.

### Reply 2:
I do not think so if they airdrop big amounts of bitcoin then the price will be affected because those who are not intersted on investing in bitcoin will sell it imeadiatly and the price will go down.

Topic: Private factors and technical issues , how PK generated and where it is stored ?
### Original post:
This is the important issue that matter for every one. The question is how does the Priave Key Is generated and where it is stored ? If the private key is generated when your computer is online then it directly can go to the o blockchain Private Key database. And it is not impossible for hackers to find it by using some kind of hacking tools. When you generate a new BTC address it automatically generate a private key and store it in the local blockchain private key dataxtorage. If you connect your computer you cannot be sure that if a pink back spy wares is present in your computer it will ultimately Transport to the hacker. For secure private key plus second stage password could be an extra security that every one need. So their fund will remain in their Bitcoin address safe. But how about offline btc transaction worked with your private key in you local network ? And how does it published latter in the Blockchain ?

### Reply 1:
What do you mean by second stage password?Do you mean 2FA? If so, it's not a good idea to use 2FA for securing your wallet. If you want to use 2FA, you have to rely on third parties and that defeats the purpose of bitcoin. Generate the keys on an air gapped device and keep them safely. That's enough.

### Reply 2:
It all depends on which approach you had taken when generating your private key because, in some cases, like using offline methods to generate randomness, your keys don't touch the online environment at all and are stored nowhere except for physical media such as paper or metal. If, however, an insecure device connected to the Internet was used to make a private key, the information of this creation could be stored on your HDD or on some remote server controlled by a malicious actor.The bitcoin blockchain has no database containing private keys, and it even doesn't care if a certain address has a corresponding private key. It only cares about data structure being present in a correct format to track the chain of ownership changes. If some of the addresses representing ownership cannot be spent due to a lack of private keys, the blockchain simply keeps this data unchanged forever.You can sign transactions offline by attaching a cryptographic signature that can only be created with a private key. An offline transaction cannot be modified or altered by a malicious actor, but to make your transaction financially significant you first need to broadcast it using whatever method of transm<rest of post truncated>

Topic: How many ancient anonymous whales are there?
### Original post:
Like people who explicitly bought or mined bitcoin with literally zero KYC back in the day when it was easy to do that. And are now moving the markets buying and selling. Is that still a thing or not? Or have pretty much all of the ancient whales touched an exchange or cashed out?

### Reply 1:
In any markets, there will always be bigger entities that will have a good amount of influence over the markets.Bitcoin is pseudonymous, so there really isn't much way to know unless they publicly disclose their positions (which they obviously wont, because it's obviously not a good idea).

### Reply 2:
It depends upon individual users and the time they sold their coins and through which medium, if you are planning to sell huge number of coins now a days, you need to verify your KYC with a centralized authority to carry on with the transaction now a days, but if you are planning to sell small amounts you can use DEX to trade without worrying about verifying anything. Things are changing with time and in the future we might be forced to carry on verification even for small amounts.

Topic: Machine Learning and Bitcoin
### Original post:
I have been recently taking some courses on the area of machine learning and artificial neural networks. This sparked some thoughts in my head about how this new advancing field of machine learning / AI relates to the cryptocurrency field. It's no secret that both these domains have been making waves individually, but what happens when they come together?Does the advancement of ML and AI help with the growth of Bitcoin as a currency, or does it hinder the growth?In terms of predictive analytics, I'm sure AI has been tried and tested to predict stock prices & etc, and failed. I'm assuming it would be the same with Bitcoin.In terms of anonymity within the Bitcoin blockchain, Machine learning can be used to track down transactions for fraudulent services and possibly help control the illegal activities transacted through bitcoin? What are your thoughts on the growth of these ""technologies"" ?

### Reply 1:
In terms of growth as in capitalism or do you mean by the advancement tin the network, for capitalism I think the would be NO, as AI cant bring fiat and have any sort of way to bring more capital to Bitcoin. In term of network modification in future there might be the possibilities but I thnk it will start a new debate as well.Descriptive analysis or predictive Ai can be helpful if you have better control of it because the Ai support we currently own not efficient enough and its not still capable to provide any sort of decision making power in most of cases.I can say your motto is good as tracking down the fraudulent transaction and things like that but they can have other consequences as well so it is also a log debating topic.

### Reply 2:
Possible, yes. No kind of technology will hinder the growth of bitcoin technology as it will adopt all kind of secured way to make the technology secured as for the cryptography. Developers will make softfork or hardfork when a bug and insecurities is detected. It's the same on the banking sectors.Stocks and any kind of trading prices are initiate by too many independent individual, no one will know how it will go in a certain time and date especially for specific price.Chainsnalysis will sure improve time after time and yes, its possible to happen.

Topic: As a Chinese, talk about my views on the new policy
### Original post:
The first is Bitcoin itselfBitcoin was used to counter the regulation of centralized institutions from the beginning, so it will inevitably be cracked down by the government and even criminalized by some governments. This does not require the government to issue a statement, it should be something we have known for a long time.Some things are not set in stone, and policies are based on actual conditions.In fact, the problems posed by Bitcoin that the Chinese government faces are different from those of some European and American countries.1. Due to the arrival of the Bitcoin bull market, many Chinese have joined the Bitcoin market, but most of them have never even heard of Nakamoto. This sounds very ridiculous, but this is the status quo in China. This part of investors has pushed the price of currencies such as doge to rise, but when the price plummets, they are likely to harm society because of losses.2. The popularity of Bitcoin mining, as Musk said, has had a negative impact on the environment and energy, forcing the Chinese government to crack down on Bitcoin mining.3.

I think what he means is that Chinese investors (or rather gamblers) are as dumb as dogshit and know nothing about what Bitcoin actually is, nor how it works. They are just a bunch of followers, who pour money into bubble after bubble until they have completely destroyed their financial positions that they can't do it anymore. After Bitcoin and stupid crap like doge they will just go into the next get rich quick scheme.Screw them, Bitcoin does not need their type, nor is it beneficial to have them involved.

### Reply 2:
I remember one post about Bitcoin which I really agree with and which a lot of people could do to see the different point of view. Bitcoin is not about taking your money out of your country, but about taking your country out of your money.This is why countries like CHINA and USA can never live in harmony with Bitcoin.With crypto, maybe. Some are okay to have some govt control. But not Bitcoin.

Topic: Smartphones & Bitcoin
### Original post:
At the onset, this thread has two purposes: Which smartphone should I get and to discuss various models and best uses in relation to Bitcoin, of which may become an ongoing dialog.In the next few days, I'll be getting a smartphone, for I'll need it to better demonstrate Bitcoin to potential new users. Early last year, I did have the new Android HTC and Verizon, but discontinued the service due to not being able to use it in the middle of nowhere where the barns were located. I calculated that I lost tens of thousands of dollars due to lost sales those close to three weeks. It was even a nightmare to revert my primary number back to my Walmart Tracfone. I will keep the Tracfone, for it's the one that works most anywhere, and use the smartphone for the populated areas. Pretty smart of me, eh? But I digress.That said, which smartphone should I consider, coupled with which carrier? I won't be streaming movies or watching many videos on the phone, but will probably do a lot of web surfing. That should be the extent of my bandwidth usage. Moreover, the device will be used and shown to others for Bitcoin <truncated> smartphone do you use and with which carrier?

There are always better phones on the horizon, but frankly, Im still using my old LG P-500 upgraded to Android 2.3 and while it doesnt feel super fast while browsing, it actually does all I need, and then some. HIgher res screen would be nice, but I dont like carrying enormous bricks around either.For the bitcoin apps out there, just about any android (2.3+) phone on the market would be fine, if not overkill.

Topic: Can the exact date of the next Bitcoin halving be determined accurately?
### Original post:
I was reading an article about Bitcoin halving when I noticed a timer, and according to them, the time tells when the next Bitcoin halving is most likely to occur.I did some research and the results were all different, and since this will be my first Bitcoin halving since becoming a part of the Bitcoin ecosystem, I'd like to know if it's really possible to know the exact date of the next halving which is to happen in the year 2024.

### Reply 1:
Noboday can say exact date of next halving.Bitcoin block reward halving happens after every 210,000 blocks since a previous halving block. It is an exact number and you can calculate a next block number at which block reward will be halved again.<link> date is impossible to say because block time is very different but the average time is about 10 minutes. Time between two blocks can be a few seconds, 10 minutes or more than 10 minutes. It makes impossible chance to say an exact date for a next halving.

### Reply 2:
Lemme school ya on the lowdown of Bitcoin halving, cuz it ain't no set-in-stone event, ya dig? It only goes down once the Bitcoin network hits a specific block height, which happens about every 210,000 blocks or so, give or take. And while we can't pin down the exact date and time of the next halving, we can make an educated guess based on the current block height and average block time.Now, I know y'all are eager to know when the next halving's gonna happen, but hold up, it ain't an exact science, my dudes. We can only estimate that it's gonna be around April or May of 2024. But don't go bettin' your life savings on that date just yet, cuz fluctuations in the mining network can still throw a wrench in our predictions

Borrowing bitcoins on the grounds of inability to bear anything, I doubt you'll get that anywhere. I think all bitcoin borrowers will at least take advantage of volatility to add value in addition to earning interest. So, thinking about it will only add to another student's inability to pay back.The cardinal rule, ""borrowing for crypto is too risky"".

### Reply 2:
The forum is for discussing about BTC, crypto and also real world subjects, it is not a platform for access to loans, credit or venture capital, if you are looking for student loan, then ask your government, they are the ones that should provide such for people of where you come from.There are forum members who give out loans to others, loans to be paid back with interests and sometimes collateral is required, this method of loan is run by the member giving out the loan and has nothing to do with the forum or its admins, these members can also reject requests based on their own choice, though i would not advice you to request for loans here because nobody will give out loans to a new account that has nothing to lose.

I doubt it. Some will stay and the landscape won't change that much. If anything, I bet regulation and government will take more control over it so they can be the major shareholders of the asset as usual. Still, at least people have the choice of not using those centralized services and keep it P2P instead. I bet we will get the same experience (exchange failure, a major hack etc) in the future whether we like it or not.

this is impossible, take a good look at the current scenario, we are heading towards KYC shit, there is no going back. there's no way to go back in time, today the market is very big, in a few months this FTX case will be part of the past and people (at least people who haven't lost money on this exchange) will have forgotten all about it and another exchange appears that people will deposit money again, centralization will only get worse with the entry of laws that governments will create. It's a matter of time before we see these lawsyou wish rich people wouldn't buy bitcoin to make a profit?the price of bitcoin will not drop to $3k, as I said, this market is already very big, the price is only going down to 15000$ because it has this FTX problem, but the market will recover

Topic: De-Fi on Bitcoin
### Original post:
So many people have been focused on ETH as new ""De-Fi"" platforms emerge over time. The number of stablecoins available on the ETH blockchain, makes ""De-Fi"" extremely attractive. It's no secret that most dApps, stablecoins, and tokens are living on Ethereum. But what if Bitcoin gets smart contract capabilities? Then it would be able to outmatch Ethereum in the ""De-Fi"" space. Luckily, there are a number of ""sidechains"" and protocols which makes this a reality. One of them is RSK (formerly known as ""Rootstock"") with its own token pegged to Bitcoin itself (exchangeable at a 1:1 ratio). Unfortunately, RSK is not very popular in the crypto/Blockchain space. As long as this is the case, Ethereum will remain as the leader of ""De-Fi"".What are your thoughts? Will ""De-Fi"" become popular on Bitcoin as ETH's fees rise all the way to the moon? Or will smart contracts on Bitcoin become a ""failed experiment""? Your input will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

### Reply 1:
As a Bitcoiner, I wouldn't mind ethereum's continued leadership of the DeFi ecosystem, I for one do not believe in DeFi and I don't think there's any need incorporating it into the Bitcoin network, DeFi came with quite a lot of hype, but most of that seem to have died down with all the hacks and scams that's happened, the more reason I'm not rooting for this.Tbh, I don't quite think there's going to be any pros for Bitcoin if DeFi is on the network, and you and I know chances are low it's going to happen, it's an 'experiment' that won't happen.

### Reply 2:
Exactly, for something to be implemented I'd like to see a problem that its directly correcting, or that it increases the quality of life of using Bitcoin. Smart contracts although being a good idea, aren't particularly useful for a majority of people. They have specific use cases, which are beneficial, but for anything to be successful it needs to be accessible to the general audience, and usable for them too. Complicating something, which many are never going to have a use for, could be detrimental to the adoption of Bitcoin. It also, doesn't mean something like DeFi will not be implemented in the future, but right now I don't see any glaring issues that it fixes.

Topic: In what ways Bitcoin is different from traditional currencies?
### Original post:
Bitcoin can be used to pay for things electronically if both parties are willing. In that sense, its like conventional dollars, euros, or yen, which are also traded digitally. But is it differs from fiat digital currencies in several important ways?

### Reply 1:
With cryptocurrencies there will be transparency and no central governing body. With traditional currencies there is a governing authority and intermediary service providers. Traditional currencies were backed by monetary policies based on which the currency is being printed. Most of the countries keep gold as reserve and prints currencies while bitcoin is completely a complex algorithm which means this is completely a technology backed asset. Digitally transfered dollars and euros were in the banks reserve while we're transferring bitcoin it is data.

### Reply 2:
You know its good that you are trying to know more about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies but I doubt it is being useful for you, because you create a new thread everyday and then ghost it like you never made it. Its worth posting if you actually read the replies and try to communicate with others. This is a forum you know, just my 2satoshis. Yes it is a lot different from traditional currencies, which you can find out by google as well much faster than asking here. Of them what I mostly value it for are that it is decentralized and the deflationary nature of the currency. What I also dont like is the pseudo-anonymity would have been great it if was completely anonymous or the opposite, not something in between.

Topic: Does anyone have a node that has been running for a long time?
### Original post:
Hi there,Does anyone here have a full node that has been running for a couple of years or more?The reason I ask is because I've only been running a node for about 6 months. This means that when I started running my node, I downloaded the blockchain, but not any of the branches that had taken place. This is because new nodes don't get blocks from branches when they start downloading the blockchain from another peer. However, once you're running a full node, your node will receive blocks from other peers, and some of these will turn in to branches (but you still keep those blocks in your blk.dat files).Therefore, my node's blockchain only contains a limited number of branches, all of which are only 1 block in length. I would like to get a hold of a blockchain with more branches so that I can code my blockchain explorer in a way that will display branches that are longer than 1 block (e.g. <link> basically, I'd like to be able to get a copy of a blockchain from a node that has been running a lot longer than mine. Anyone know where (and how) I could get one?

### Reply 1:
You can install the latest node and then start a torrent download. There are many available... just download the latest one and your sync time will be shorter. One example of torrent download can be found in our forum:<link> luck!

Topic: Bitcoin has a bad reputation (we should fix it)
### Original post:
Hello everyone!I've been thinking a lot about Bitcoin adoption lately and I think that adoption is still pretty slow partly because of the Bitcoin reputation. Despite it being a progressive technology of the future, a lot of people still think that it's a joke.So there is different opinion among people about Bitcoin. Some people consider Bitcoin as ""criminal money"" because it's often used on the dark web and helps criminals to get away with selling drugs and stuff. There are also people who think that Bitcoin is a bubble that will explode and lose its value, so they don't trust it. It's probably because these people don't know how Bitcoin and blockchain work.And there is a third group of people who think that Bitcoin is used just for gambling so they don't want to buy it.I think it would be good if we can convince these people that they are wrong. I know that an obvious way to do it would be an education, which will help A LOT. But as for now, do you think there are other ways to change these people's opinions?Like would it be good if we could create a system that somehow will make the life of criminals who use Bitcoin harder?

### Reply 1:
People are free with their minds and they can think Bitcoin is either a joke, a fraud or a virtual thing. You don't need to convince anyone that Bitcoin is a good thing with good reputation. It was not created to be used for criminal activities including dark markets and money laundering so it is not related to bad reputation caused by those activities.Is Alfred Nobel related to many deaths in the Russia invasion to Ukraine and Russia - Ukraine war? He is not responsible for it and you know who is responsible for it.He has patent for dynamite but he is not responsible for people who used it to kill others, in wars and invasions.Tell them about bubbles and collapses from banks. Bitcoin is not dead but many banks were dead.<link>

### Reply 2:
I don't think it's slow, adoption also takes a long time so I don't know where you're getting this. Regarding the reputation, can you list at least some reasons as to why do you think that it's the reason that the adoption is slow. Give us an example like an article about people that think that bitcoin is a joke. You need to cover your bases my guy because you're spouting nonsense right now.

Topic: Keypoint to watch in D-34 BTC halving: Miner's hashrate
### Original post:
Xangles viewpoint in D-34 BTC halving: Miners hashrate<link> to crypto disclosure platform Xangle, crypto investors must pay close attention to Bitcoins hashrate as the halving event is just around the corner especially since previous halving events show that price follows hashrate.The report states that Bitcoin hashrate has increased by more than 19,766% in a year since its first halving event in November 28, 2012. Price soared after, gradually increasing by a staggering 8,069%. The second Bitcoin halving in July 9, 2016 showed similar results its price (+284%) followed the hashrate (+248%)For such reasons, we must attend closely to BTC hashrate. However, this time there are several unexpected variables that might affect Bitcoins upcoming hashrate, including the coronavirus (the hashrate has decreased by 24% already). Please check the details in Xangle Just the FACTs.

### Reply 1:
that is wrong and ignorant of a lot of things.for starters price from 2012-11-28 to 2013-04-08 went from $11.75 to $259.34 which is a huge rise of 2107% in the same time frame hashrate went from 29 TH/s to 61 TH/s which is a tiny rise of 110%.this proves that hashrate grows after price rise and at a slower speed not before it which means you can NEVER predict price by looking at hashrate since you would be looking at history.secondly it is ignoring a very important revolution in bitcoin mining called ASICs. they were released in 2013 and by mid 2013 the hashrate rising speed changed because of them not because of price.same exact thing for 2016 happened. the halving happened on 2016-07-09 by then price was already on the rise for 7 month from $150 to $778 which is 418% price rise. in the same time frame hashrate went from 1.0 EH/s to 1.6 EH/s which is a teeny tiny rise of 60% in comparison to price rise.again you can see that hashrate follows price after price rise not the other way around.same thing after the halving too. price went from correction at $465 to $1139 in 5 months right after halving but the hashrate went up from 1.6EH/s to 2 EH/s which is 145% price rise versus 25% h<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 2:
It could be mean cheaper and better mining machines or better power deals. It's nothing much to do with tomorrow's price. They have massive outgoings to meet today. If you'd told people on here in 2017 what the hash rates would be today and asked them to guess the price they'd be saying it was telephone numbers rather than 3-6x lower than back then.

Topic: Lightning Labs (devs of LND) trying to kill open source and hijack the protocol
### Original post:
There has been recent upheaval within the lightning community about the behavior of Lightning LabsFirst, @L0laL33tz raised the issue that Lightning Labs was associating with the World Economic Forum and others who are behind the Great Reset plans. Here are the main threads.Opening salvo, Clarification, Doubling downThis all seemed fishy, but then things got worse: many open-source developers came out in the open, airing out frustrations they have had with Lightning Labs over the way they have been engaging in the open-source space. The short version is that LL has been using the tried and tested ""embrace, extend, extinguish"" policy towards killing open-source.EEE's playbook is to enter product categories involving widely used standards, extending those standards with proprietary capabilities, and then using those differences in order to strongly disadvantage its competitors.Here are the main tweets: From ACINQ, RustyTwit and BlueMatt (bonus)We need to root out Lightning Labs, stop using LND, and move towards alternative implementations like C-Lightning.

### Reply 1:
I had actually created a topic about this subject, but you add a few new bits of information that I didn't yet know about, thanks for that!Honestly, I've been following Lightning development for years now and I can tell you guys Rusty has put in a ton of work, not only in implementation but also in the specs & if he speaks out against LL, it has to be taken seriously. The whole story seems messy and not trivial to answer - in my opinion, the WEF didn't just put LL on their site without asking and without them noticing; I am pretty confident they knew about it and made 0 efforts (not even now) to have it removed from their website. That is already a big red flag. All the further stuff like LL guys putting specs into question etc. don't make it better.For my part, I'm glad I use C-Lightning exclusively. I will soon make an 'Apollo BTC + C-Lightning' setup guide as well, hopefully adding many many more C-Lightning nodes to the network. Hopefully, when Futurebit will add Lightning natively, it will be built on C-Lightning. I will also make sure to open a few new channels, especially at these lower prices that we currently have.

### Reply 2:
I'd say that the majority of those users don't have a Lightning channel either. They just want to use Lightning without the fatigue of maintaining a channel e.g., by using hubs such as BlueWallet's. Such as? Private data?

Topic: If bitcoin as currency, how the merchant manage the block confirmation?
### Original post:
Using fintech like Alipay or anything is a different thing because it's centralized and controlled by the bank using a ""trust"" system even it's a ""fake transaction"" if you can breach or found a bug in their system, blockchain system solves this problem because it using the trustless system. But the problem of bitcoin in nature is it took time to make the transaction confirmed. Assuming I'm walking to KFC and want to buy one FC using an automated cashier and scan the QR code for bitcoin payment, likely the machine accepts it but you must wait until you got one confirmation and you get the receipt, if you are unlucky you'll wait up to one hour just to get the receipt out of the machine. How will the merchant solve this thing if used as currency which needs fast transaction?

### Reply 1:
Answer 1.If merchant knows who you are, they don't need to wait for confirmation. They can prosecute you for theft if you fail to pay.Answer 2.If the price of the product is low, the merchant does not need to wait for confirmation. They can take a small risk of you committing fraud with the knowledge that 99.99% of customers will not. Same as taking small risk of counterfeit fiat or of credit card fraud.Answer 3.If the customer does not use RBF, the merchant can reduce risk by monitoring the Bitcoin network to make sure that the proper fee is paid and that transaction has propagated well. There is VERY SMALL risk that the transaction will not confirm eventually.Answer 4.If the customer leaves a deposit with the merchant ahead of time, then the merchant can subtract the cost of the product from the deposit and/or can return the difference to the customer.Answer 5.If the customer leaves a credit card registered with the merchant, then the merchant can use the credit card as a backup in case the bitcoin transaction is fraud.Answer 6.Use lightning Network.Answer 7.Use centralized services such as Coinbase or BitPay to manage payments. Service takes on risk management.Answer 8.Smart mer<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 2:
Ultimately, it comes down to trust. The same way handing cash to the cashier does too. Merchants already check certain notes for counterfeiting, but they are well aware that customers will sometimes try to pull the wool over their eyes, or actually be using counterfeit money without them actually knowing it is counterfeit. So, the problems that exist with Bitcoin, largely exist in fiat too. The difference, and the only valid point here is the confirmation time. However, as explained above, and just to expand upon it; It is ultimately up to the discretion of the merchant, whether or not they wait for a confirmation or not. Many don't, because there's a very small chance that anything does go wrong, once the transaction turns up on the Blockchain. Bitcoin might not be acceptable for fast food chains or takeaways which would require confirmations. However, as suggested above you usually pay your check after the fact you've eaten your meal. Therefore, Bitcoin would be no different, because as long as a adequate fee was used it should be confirmed by the time your done eating. What I do think could potentially happen; is the fee process will become streamlined, and there will be a merch<rest of post truncated>

Topic: Son Poisons Father In Attempt To Steal Bitcoin Wallet Funds
### Original post:
These are shocking news revealing how far a son can reach to steal money from his own father. The case happened in Maryland, USA. Father and son were crypto investors and had already made some decent profit from their investments. The son, however, besides suffering from drugs addiction, wasn't satisfied with his part of the profit and wanted his father to cashout more money.The father disagreed and said the son he should stop doing drugs instead. Upset, the son executed a plan where he poisoned his own father with a tea containing a high dose of benzodiazepines, which lead the man to fall unconscious, being found only 2 days later lay in his apartment and staying 4 days recovering on the hospital.With the cellphone in hands, the son was able to access his father's funds and move two-thirds of the portfolio into ethereum, before being found and arrested. Now he is going to be moved to a rehab clinic for addicted. Glad the history didn't end so tragic as it could, as the victim is alive and recovered.Son Almost Kills Father In Attempt To Steal $400,000 In Cryptocurrency

### Reply 1:
He wasn't very smart. He saw Bitcoin in a bear market so he sold it and bought an altcoin. -50% for bitcoin usually means -60% or more for altcoins and that includes ETH. We don't know what his father said in court. Maybe he did not want his son to be punished too severely, maybe told the story of his son being an addict.We don't know if the investment was 50/50. It was 100k, but maybe most of it belonged to the father and the son had a part of profits because it was his idea...His father probably knew that the money would be spent on drugs so he told Liam to stop taking or go to rehab and then ask for the money. I'd probably do the same, even if it 50% was his money. I wouldn't want to live with the thought that he got the money and gave it all to some dealer.

### Reply 2:
The source of the problems of all these attempted murders on his father is because his son has become a drug addict and he continues to need drugs so he needs more money.Cases like this are very sad when the son tries to kill his own father to steal Dana from his father's bitcoin wallet. Even he already had his own share but it certainly wouldn't be enough for the need to buy the forbidden item.grateful that this case did not end tragically and his father is still alive.Crypto or money does not look at anyone to do evil, even to one's own family as in this case. securing assets is very important and not just securing, it needs some backups and some additional security so that it cannot be accessed by others and never publish your personal portfolio to the public because it will be very dangerous.

Two words: Bitcoin Lasertag.Imagine it. Whether playing as an individual or as part of a team, the whole premise is exactly the same as regular laser tag, but with much higher stakes. Shooting someone with your laser would initiate a Bitcoin transfer from the tagged to the tagger or the tagger's team (depending on whether it's a solo or team game). For example:.1 BTC for shots in the stomach or back.3 BTC for shots on the shoulders.5 BTC for a barrel shotHow fucking cool would this be? Obviously there'd need to be some regulations to make sure people can't tag others before or after the game starts. But, I would totally own all of you

Though you don't provide any source link. And we can't verify your statement. But if this news is true then it will be my point of view on this.Whats a big news on this. This is like an eye wash to the users of crypto. Us government has a strong point of cybersecurity world. The whole world know that us has the world most intelligent cyber security agency whom are always aware and working to track all type of cyber criminal. And in my opinion they are enough capable to do it. Then why government need to hire others where the teacker can be more dangerous because the cyber criminal has also fund to buy those trackers who will track cyber criminal for multi million dollar money. I think its can be another type of money waste eye wash. Can't understand a single time in my whole life about government any decision or step. Though what can we do now best wishes for those who are going to do tracking cyber criminal. A best wish to you guys so that you can be success and grab this multi million dollar. Don't offended guys its just my point of view your point of view can be different. Thanks for understand.

### Reply 2:
Today i read one blog from CNN about this that the US Government are going to give $10 million for information that can find malicious cyber actors to target critical US infrastructure.This news has been published on Thursday. So i think the news is correct. And we should stay tuned whether this news really going to be true or not.

Topic: Business Beyond Bitcoin  All About Enterprise Blockchain
### Original post:
Enterprise technologies have primarily aimed at making business processes and transactions more reliable and faster. But up until now, no technology has changed the very nature of enterprise computing ever since the mainframe era, as blockchain promises to do. The potential is immense, and the world is just beginning to wake up to enterprise blockchain computing.For almost everyone in touch with the modern world, the word blockchain conjures images of overnight wealth, rags to riches and billionaire hacker geniuses in stylish hoodies. If that rung a bell, its also because most of us equate blockchain with the worlds first and most popular cryptocurrency, bitcoin. Agreed that bitcoin was one of the earliest implementations of blockchain and innumerable cryptocurrencies that followed have since crowded the internet by no small measure, the attention on the underlying technology is largely lacking. Yes, blockchain has the potential to change the world, and yes, it will change the way businesses transact for a long, long time to come.

Topic: Critical mass community
### Original post:
It would be a good experiment to find a small community where all of the merchants and the citizens could be given the tools and perhaps a few starter Bitcoins as a trial run and let Bitcoins take hold as their currency of choice.The key would be that it has to be small enough where almost everyone in the community can be converted, they would likely need to be young and perhaps tech savvy, and they would have to do a fair amount of in-town spending of their money.There are plenty of small redneck towns but they would likely reject anything new. Perhaps a small college community would be a good start, or something along those lines.I was thinking along the lines of giving everyone a Bitcoincard once it comes out along with like 2 Bitcoins each to get things started.

### Reply 1:
You know I thought about this earlier... perhaps going back to the community in North Carolina that was using the Liberty Dollar. They got shut down when the feds raided Liberty Dollar, but that couldn't happen with bitcoins of course...<link> we should reach out to Kevin Innes.

In order to create a watching-only wallet, you had to import the seed from somewhere. That somewhere is where the bitcoins were sent.

Topic: Lighning Network will scale Bitcoin Adoption
### Original post:
The promise of lightning network is fast and cheap transaction when doing micro payment. I want to know, with near approximation, what can be the gas fee for making a payment of $5 using ligtning network?Also, are there other materials and good videos that could help me to learn how to make payment using LN? looking forward to your rich contributions.

### Reply 1:
If you want to dip your toes into trying Lightning, as of now the best noob-friendly wallet I've seen is Phoenix Wallet[1]. They're currently Android-only though. (iOS still in beta.)[1] <link>

### Reply 2:
The promise of lightning network is implemented; it's no longer a promise comparing with lots of altcoins that pledge to solve the scaling issue.You mean the transaction fee?Well, it depends. If you want to transact once and never use the LN again, then you'll have to pay for two on-chain transactions; one for opening the channel and one for closing it. In other words, if you want to transact only once, you have no reason to use the LN. Just broadcast an on-chain transaction instead. The lightning network exists to achieve transacting micro amounts with the lowest fee possible. It also allows you to spend dust amounts in constrast with the main layer.If you want to start using it and being keen on it, then you'll realize how cheap it really is. Each transaction I've made costed 1 satoshi. ONE!

Topic: Just bought FBTC in my 401k. First time ever holding crypto for retirement.
### Original post:
I have a feeling that the wide availability of Bitcoin ETFs will herald one of the longest and most stable bull markets for Bitcoin that we have seen to date. I've always invested in BTC using a private wallet but with Fidelity's offering I feel fairly safe and confident putting a portion of my 401k into it. I had to check a few boxes that I accept the risk but other than that Fidelity authorized the transaction.

### Reply 1:
Just by being a consistent member of this forum, you can learn how bitcoin works And also understand the risk involved so that you can directly invest in Bitcoin and understand what you are getting into so that your investment in Bitcoin will be one that has a good testimony at the end. By only owning ETF's, you are not going to really enjoy the full benefits of bitcoins like the privacy and self custody, you still will have to pay maintenance fees which somehow is not different from the regular bank charges always complained about.

### Reply 2:
Investing in ETFs compared to Bitcoin actually has disadvantages such as freedom and Bitcoin we cannot control completely. And investing in an ETF means we don't own the underlying asset directly, in this case bitcoin. This means you lose certain benefits, such as the ability to spend our bitcoins directly and some other points. As is usually done with our own Bitcoin holdings with complete freedom. Additionally, ETFs typically require higher fees due to brokerage fees, and this is obviously a bit different compared to actual Bitcoin.And there are definitely advantages and disadvantages, and it is best to carry out thorough and detailed analysis and research before making a decision and also as a consideration.

Topic: Covid-19 effects on Bitcoin
### Original post:
Will the upcoming Bitcoin halving be a non-event due to the state of the world economy affected by COVID-19 ?

### Reply 1:
First of all there is no upcoming halving atleast for next 4 years. Halving has already taken place a month back. Moreover it's sort of an automatic event which would happen irrespective of COVID-19. How can it be a non-event?What I think you are trying to ask is that, bitcoin halving might not have impact on price due to COVID-19. First of all you need to understand that Halving is not a guarantee that there would be the next bull run. So the answer to your question is both Yes and No. As significant event Halving was for bitcoin so was the lockdown during Covid for Economy. Now, one school of thought thinks that COVID would have positive effect on crypto therefore both halving and covid will have positive impact then price could rally up. But if Covid has negative impact on Crypto then both could offset each other and we might not see any significance of this Halving. But halving reduces supply in a bit long term not instantly so we have to wait for an year atleast to see effects of Halving on BTC.

### Reply 2:
Halving and covid 19 has nothing in relation, bitcoin halving is normal event in bitcoin circulatory supply, it occurs every four years, so far bitcoin is existing, covid 19 has no effect on bitcoin halving, it can only have effect on bitcoin price. And like you said, by 2024 which is the year for the next halving, covid 19 will be long gone and it will have no effect on the price as well.

Topic: Idea for a site - Bitcoin Sweepstakes.
### Original post:
Imagine you have a race ,could be a horse race or a car race or whatever. Like the Melbourne Cup in Australia. Each <truncated> is given a bitcoin address to deposit too. To enter people supply a withdrawal address and pay the entry fee against their choice of participant. When the race is finished and a winner is known whoever bet on the winner gets the losers money divided by however many people chose the winner. Possibly you could have more than one winner. The site would receive a small cut from the losers pot to pay for itself. This would be fun to do at something like the world cup for soccer or even an olympic 100m final dont you think ? Especially if everyone could meet in a chat room and watch the race together

### Reply 1:
Nice idea, bitcoin.me. How would you adjust the odds when/if they changed?

### Reply 2:
you don't, ... the wagers themselves do. parimutuel betting: <link> and satoshi dice are two forms of blockchain-based online betting. parimutuel could be another.because the payments go through the peer-to-peer network and not through some website, it could be run from a country where it isn't illegal to offer. the website simply shows the bets and the current odds.one of the difficulties with betting for parimutuel is that everyone waits until the last minute to wager as the range for the odds becomes narrower. using the blockchain would be a little frustrating as you don't know if the current block will be mined before the bet closing (e.g., before the start of the race).this betting system would be suitable for just about any contest.

Topic: Celebrities Embracing bitcoin because of Divorce?
### Original post:
Recently, I found threads on this forum about celebrities such as footballers, musicians, e.t.c embracing bitcoin and choosing it as a payment method for brand endorsements. On the second note: I thought about it this way; since they are an increase in divorce in their industry, especially the musicians. Could holding bitcoin be a plan B for securing their assets if their spouse files for a divorce? In search of an answer: I read a Law Firm blog that said something about sharing bitcoin 50/50 during a divorce. They clarified that any bitcoin transaction that occurred while the holder is married belongs to the marriage fund and can be shared if divorce arises and vice versa. How do they get to know the truth?They claim that some questions when asked to a spouse, would determine if they hold bitcoin (that's if they answered correctly or genuinely). They can track a spouse's bitcoin transactions through the person's hard drive. They urge people to open up about every asset they hold. Including; bitcoin when in court. After a brief thought, I concluded my thoughts about some single (Not married) celebrities. Observing the rapid increase in the divorce of their colleagues would see bitc<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Such a weird topic but I can't deny that some people may have done it or in the process of doing so. The problem with these celebrities is that most of them started late. I mean it's probably harder to hide your fiat to crypto transactions now since KYC is already a norm among exchanges.

### Reply 2:
but if you are using your own wallet and not third party wallet or exchange, you won't need to submit any vital info. you can actually save your satoshis in btc core or any other noncustodial wallet, without informing anyone. but i prefer to have prenup agreements if you are worried about your assets in case your relationship don't work out. this is not because you don't trust the other person but it will save you lawyer's fees and all if in case you parted ways with the other person.

Topic: Honestly, Bitcoin fits in this gap more than others.
### Original post:
Come to think of it Bitcoin is the most reliable digital currency that everything in the world today should move closer to, but the greediness and power in men won't let them.They can't control it, and that's why they hate it.Being decentralized is a part why the government should embrace Bitcoin in the world today, it's the only digital currency that can bring peace if allowed as a means of payment around the country.Instead the Banks are getting in relations with Chainlink and XRP, something that's built centralized and imagine many countries start using these centralized coins and the same FTX shit happens, how will that go? Not good right? If Bitcoin take that place instead it will be a smooth breeze, the government will have peace themselves, there will be no betrayer of sort because no one have power or control over Bitcoin.To me Bitcoin just fits in the gap more than any others, oh but the heart of men anyway.

### Reply 1:
This is like a Hype assessment for example. They will ban accounts related to Bitcoin, and freeze their balances and if I look at this it is only for a while and but in the long term I think they (countries) will move forward and change something in global trade in the future .That's right, as you stated above We will go through a lot of bubbles over the next few years as these currencies become more widely understood, used, and adopted. Yes. no one has power or control over Bitcoin.

### Reply 2:
I'd say your whole topic is painting an incomplete picture because you are not focusing on all the aspects.It's true that bitcoin is the only decentralized censorship resistant currency in the world and has a high level of security and these things make it very reliable. But also there is a downside which is the volatile price, even though it doesn't make it unreliable but it is something to keep in mind. Which means it is not only ""greed"" and ""power"" that prevents bitcoin's adoption. There are other reasons too like the volatility.First the economy has to change. Right now it is designed to work in a centralized way.Look around the world and see what is going on.For example in United States, ever since a year+ ago when the energy prices started to rise and caused inflation in US, the regime started battling it with increasing interest rates. But over the long run that means recession and at the same time the regime has to pay higher interest to US debt bagholders. They don't have nearly enough money to pay it (almost a trillion dollar), so the US economy either has to fail then and there or they have to print that much (remember the debt ceiling battle). Obviously the printed that<rest of post truncated>

Topic: Three basic fact you would love to know about bitcoin
### Original post:
Bitcoin is a digital asset that can be stored at a cryptocurrency exchange or in a digital wallet. Each individual coin represents the value of Bitcoins current price, but you can also own partial shares of each coin. The smallest denomination of each Bitcoin is called a Satoshi, sharing its name with Bitcoins creator. Each Satoshi is equivalent to a hundred millionth of one Bitcoin, so owning fractional shares of Bitcoin is quite common.Below are facts you would love to know about bitcoin 1. The coins are created by users who ""mine"" them by lending computing power to verify other users transactions which use blockchain technology.They receive Bitcoins in exchange.2.The coins also can be bought and sold on exchanges with US dollars and other fiat currencies(the physical money we use every day in our bank accounts).3. Bitcoins have to be stored in a digital wallet, either online through an exchange like Coinbase, or offline on a hard drive using specialised software.It is believed that crypto currency is actually used in most countries today but it has not yet been known, although bitcoin is one of the fast rising crypto currency in the world today most people still don't understand<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Bitcoin was not designed to be exchanged using third parties like centralised exchanges but for P2P transactions. You can easily exchange your Bitcoin with another bitcoiner without any intermediary. It is improper to store in centralised exchanges because they are not reliable. These platforms can easily be affected by hacks and negative government policies. The owners of these exchanges could also pull an exit scam or mismanage the business. Bitcoin is mostly used by many people as an investment platform. They buy, hodl and sell when the price appreciates. Others mainly in developing nations use Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation.

### Reply 2:
This two points you've raised are nothing than the exact explanation of a scenario of seeing someone using his strength and efforts to explain to the public that apple is a fruit, this is what even a little child can know or understand without having you go through loads of stress explaining.We have either a custodial wallet or non custodial wallet to use for our bitcoin storage, however, we must understand this that our bitcoin aren't stored on these wallet, they are being stored on the blockchain, wallets only provides us the keys to unlocking them to have access to them.

I primarily use BTC in certain gaming websites which accept BTC as a form of payment. They provide other payment options too like Paypal, Debit card, Credit card etc, but I stick to BTC since it is far more convenient and the volatility does not affect me.Example: G2A(<link>

### Reply 2:
The only thing that I have bought using bitcoin is a gift card, but now I need to be so careful if I want to use bitcoin to buy something as it is illegal in my country to use bitcoin as a payment method. Lucky for those who live in countries where bitcoin are accepted as alternative payment method.

Unfortunately TradingView is probably the best that you can use. As far as I know if there is indeed a group that whales converse in, chances are, it's going to be a really private group. Probably anywhere else besides TradingView is mostly going to be memes and shitposts(feel free to prove me wrong though).

Topic: Bitcoin miners energy usage has exceeded 50%, where is Elon?
### Original post:
This is only according to an analyst from Bloomberg. However, if this is confirmed real information then the question from the community should be will cousin Elon support his statement and begin accepting bitcoin payments in Tesla again?Tesla also should start buying again hehehe. The Bitcoin network, with its continually increasing hash rate, has seen a corresponding decrease in its emissions intensity, according to recent reports from Bloomberg. Analyst Jamie Coutts explained that this trend is contrary to most other industries and could potentially trigger the next wave of institutional investment. Data cited by Coutts on Monday revealed that the sustainable energy mix for Bitcoin has been steadily rising since 2021 and now exceeds 50%. This increase in sustainable energy use has resulted in a slower growth of emissions relative to the network's expansion. Coutts noted that the evolving relationship between Bitcoin network growth and the global push to transition from fossil fuels could ""catalyze a wave of institutional and even sovereign investment capital.""Read in full <link>

### Reply 1:
I guess it's obvious that Elon Musk just used Bitcoin as his clout for his company during our the last bull run. Take advantage of it and then later sells their stash to take over Twitter, now X.And it's not rocket science though, we have our own thread here: by <truncated> the ""Bitcoin is an environmental disaster"" argument.And I doubt that this whole sustainable energy mix for bitcoin will be the next narrative for the next bull. It might be the whole ""Bitcoin Spot ETF approvals"" in the future that we might see waves of institutional investor pouring their money in the market. Or even rich oil money from Middle East could also be possible.

### Reply 2:
I don't know if Elon cares. Or should we care whether he cares or not? Or it's perhaps better if Elon leaves Bitcoin alone. It seems that all these calls on Elon Musk to take a look at Bitcoin mining's energy usage once again and reconsider accepting Bitcoin payment once more for Tesla or even reinvestment on Bitcoin are merely subtle ways of begging, ""come on Elon please, push the price up!"" It might not be about adoption or whatever.There were negative remarks made against Elon just as there were against Buffet and Bill Gates and others who prefer not to shill for Bitcoin. Sometimes, they seem nothing more than bitter attacks against rich personalities whose money won't bring Bitcoin's price higher.

Topic: Why Bitcoin is not universally adopted and how to change it
### Original post:
Lets face it: crypto adoption has been going down for quite some time. There are fewer and fewer merchants accepting Bitcoin, let alone other cryptocurrencies. This is a bit surprising, given that many issues hampering adoption in the early days have been sorted out: user interfaces got a lot safer and friendlier, major cryptocurrencies are much less volatile than they once were, the assortment of tools for merchants as well as consumers has substantially increased, layer 2 solutions addressing bottlenecks are becoming practical, and yetA once-popular crypto-only travel agency, BTCtrip.com has closed shop, leaving unfulfilled orders and defaults on refunds in its wake. Restaurants that once accepted crypto payments no longer do. Fewer and fewer webshops offer crypto as payment options.In this article Daniel Nagy, a software architect and Ethereum developer, explains why this is happening and how this trend can be reversed.<link>

### Reply 1:
Oh thanks, I don't have to read the article but I'll base my response to what op has said. How it became that ""fewer and fewer"" merchants that accepts bitcoin? Instead of those words, we can use slowly adopting or increasing and that makes it more articulate.And these merchants does have a better option now with third party services that they can use for the bitcoin payments as their service provider.

### Reply 2:
I can see a negative feedback rising above this thread topic. I know some of them who refuses to adopt bitcoin and other cryptocurrency are those close minded people who dont learn and study it first. Most projects that are introduced are flagged as scam and I cant blame those who fall into those shitty ICOs that lurking around this business especially around 2018-2019. But lets face it. Adoption is growing and this post is made for fud. The article is very negative towards this and likely the author must be one of the victim or paid to do this crappy content.End of conversation. This is a fud, good luck OP I see an accusation on Meta.

Topic: Principles of Bitcoin
### Original post:
Principles of BTC You do not trust a CEO. You do not trust a company. You do not trust a custodian. You do not trust a bank. You hold your own keys. You run your own node. The #bitcoin network will run for the next 1,000 years, explains <truncated> incidents like that of FTX occur you will remember why btc remains at the top and will always reign supreme. Another lesson for those who think exchanges are the best option to secure their funds. Not Your Keys, Not Your Money. Do Not Forget.

### Reply 1:
There were some threads who were claiming that exchangers are far better and safer as compared to the wallets because they could recover your losses by compensating to you. I am sure this news might have hit them very hard on their face. ROFL. I might be sounding little rude but I am really saying this in the most fun and smile way as I could!That man Satoshi, he literally saw the vision of market a decade ago and still there are people who ""THINK"" having custody of our funds to someone's hand is best way to safeguard it. For example, banks. I hope we have not forgotten the Russian incidence were cash were so short that they halted the ATM and also restricted cash withdrawals. Then in crypto XRP, LUNA, then binance hack, KuKoin hack and now FTX falling, but all you need is BTC to stay in your own control. If it does not get values then that's not a problem, we will keep BTC = BTC and trade in that language/fashion only. #NYKNYM

### Reply 2:
I think people relearned the lesson again. There is so many incidents like this before the FTX but people never learned and they still keep their cryptocurrency on exchanges. I hope this FTX incident will awaken people who get used to leaving their cryptocurrency in third-party services.But is it really possible to not use and exchange? How can you convert your Bitcoin to cash then? Or how can you buy Bitcoin with your cash if you do not use an exchange?

Topic: Gaurd yourself this year against crypto scams
### Original post:
It's a new year again and we all know what lies in wait, scammers are thinking of more innovative ways to decive and pollute the crypto community again and the one I hate the most are these wannabes that come and taint our fav coin image by creating not just inferiors but empty coins. They come I form of rug pulls, pump and dump all trying to scam crypto users who are ill informed. Not to long from now one new Influencer would start promoting a new rugpull, pls let none of us fall for such silly tricks anymore we are way past that already.But any way let me remind you of how you can quickly save yourself from falling into these malicious snares.get rid of your get rich quick mentality : I know a lot of persons would be expecting me to say read their whitepaper, but like I said this guys are getting more smart and making a good whitepaper with excellent road map and all would not be a problem to them. But thign I know they can't change so easily is their offers, they would always work on your greed, trying to entice you with silly offers that are so good to be true. I'm crying right now cause I also wished they were true, but sorry they aren't and don't fall to such this year. track<rest of post truncated>

I notice that you are creating threads almost everyday. You are making yourself too obvious in hunting for something. You are not even proofreading your posts. I think it is impossible for a year to have zero victims of scam. That's not possible in crypto. That's not possible outside crypto either. What we can only hope is that the figures of stolen or scammed money at the end of the year is much lower than the previous year. If that continues year after year, that's achievement enough.

Well, d'oh, in countries with <truncated> there are three, Venezuela, South Sudan, and Zimbabwe.Argentina, Sudan, and Iran are also experiencing 50% inflation per year.But I don't know that much about <truncated> you can't.Yeah, it's legalized but it doesn't mean shops or businesses are forced to accept bitcoin payments in Germany.You can't go to Aldi, ReWe, SPAR or Edeka and buy stuff with bitcoins and unfortunately avoiding the big names there are still too few shops accepting bitcoins. Yeah in the big cities you could let's say survive by paying with bitcoins but it would be a nightmare and you will lose so much time you will soon quit.Note: I'm talking about bitcoin payments, not buying a bitcoin debitcard, not paying with bitpay like services, nothing else.

### Reply 2:
Yes. It's pretty much mostly the <truncated> people and people in countries that experienced hyperinflation that's holding bitcoin; and this is the exact reason why people in the crypto space always say that we're still in the very early stages of bitcoin's adoption. The masses are simply still very skeptical of bitcoin(which is really to be expected) as it's a very very new asset. It will take time for the people to get used to the existence of bitcoin, as they mostly still see it as a fad.

Of course not!Government is only intelligent when it comes to preserving its own power. It's a myth that government officials are working for the greater public good. The people in charge will do everything to preserve the status quo, because they are greatly rewarded by it. If working for the whole society helps in that regard, officials will be willing to do that, too.However that is not the case for Bitcoin. Bitcoin challenges the status quo. Many powerful people have a lot to loose. They will try to do everything to prevent Bitcoin from being successful. We as a community must be aware that these people will use the full spectrum of manipulation, intrigue and oppression to defend their privileged position.ya.ya.yo!

Topic: Size of transactions ?
### Original post:
Steam require at least one confirmation when you buy using Bitcoin , my transaction took too long and when I checked blockchain.info I saw that there is no new blocks (It took sometime) then I noticed something else which is the ""Total sent"" and ""Size (Kb)"" columns.So here is the thing , sometimes the Size doesn't even reach 1mb but the amounts in ""Total sent"" is higher then the blocks where there is a lower amount of BTC sent , so I'm really wondering how is the size calculated ? I'm pretty sure It has nothing to do with how much BTC is sent or received.

### Reply 1:
It mostly depends on the number of inputs and outputs. I say mostly because even a couple of extra symbols can make a transaction larger, so if a more advanced user inserted a custom script inside a transaction it will increase the size too. It actually makes perfect sense because everything have size in the internet.

### Reply 2:
To the question ""how is it calculated?"", the answer is ""clearly, quite poorly"". This is Blokchain.info, they've made a USP out of this sort of mistake for a while now.General answer is: inputs. How many inputs are you using for your transaction, the more those mount up, the larger the overall transaction will be on the blockchain.

Watching the Beyond Bitcoin : Morning Webcast Session : <link> - I could not help by realizing howpeople in the USA and many other countries over complicate issues. There are so many hidden agendas, when a new and ground breaking innovation occur, that we are gettingbogged down in the mud in the useless noise. Banks join the discussions and try to protect their profits / Ripple and competing Alt coins try to grab a share of the markets andthird-party operators like BitPay and exchanges want a share of the pie.

Barry {but thats just my opinion}What I do know is, that Bitcoin is not going to go away quietly and the Public Blockchain will be here for the long ride, until the bankers and the lobbyists and the people with these hidden agendas have managed to use their full resources to influence the regulators to either slow it down or to ban it.

I think most of those people in that meeting have a good idea about Bitcoin and the Blockchain and they are gearing up to gather as much input from the experts, before they can approach the legislators. It would have been better if they could have had some developers or Bitcoin representatives there, without any business interests. The afternoon session was just as informative and I sat through the 5 hour webcast for the whole thing to see what the direction will be for these discussions. I think a lot of education is still needed to bring the legislators on board.

Topic: Do you think it's still wrong selling properties for Bitcoin?
### Original post:
I am this close to making double of my money yesterday when I looked at my Bitcoin wallet, this was the Bitcoin I bought at 17k with two acres of farm lands I sold in 2022, I still feel very happy right now because of my decision, I believe that some risks are worth taking and mine is paying off, some people tried to talk me out of this, if I have keep the lands yes it could grow big in future, but the fastest growth of Bitcoin is far more enticing for me.I am not trying to tell anyone to sell their properties to buy Butcoin, I have more lands that's why I am able to sell for Bitcoin, I think it's wrong having a land or two and sell because of Bitcoin, but if you have more, it's going to worth the risk, nothing grows insanely well like bitcoin does. I am excited to see how 2024 and 2025 will play out, tell me, is anyone taking such risks with Bitcoin investment? Do you think I went too far selling something as valuable as lands?

### Reply 1:
If you don't know enough about Bitcoin and are rushing to sell your assets merely to invest in Bitcoin, you're making the wrong decision since you're being dominated by your emotions. In my perspective, there is nothing wrong with selling properties, especially if you have a large number of them left. If you have proper knowledge and a plan, investing in cryptocurrency is a good move.

### Reply 2:
I can not sell my land or property to buy bitcoin. It will make me look like I am risking too much and which could affect me. My property remain my property and the land will continue to increase in value too. This is what I will think and I will not sell my land. Sometimes it is not about the profit, but diversification. Out of the money I am seeing weekly, I can buy bitcoin using DCA, or can save the money weekly and keep it until bitcoin fall to certain price and buy. I use money to buy bitcoin directly, I mean from my salary, but my properties not what I can sell.

The company uses Lightning Network to make things easy and simple for the citizens or customers to make transactions. According to the company by next month they are going to circulate Bitcoin in all their outlets. That means, Bitcoin is going to be circulated around to a maximum way in South Africa.

@so98nnI have tried to do the same but couldn't find any news from their official website. It seems that this news is coming from many crypto news websites but not from the main party. So I have tried to create an order using one of my friend's address in Pretoria and it seems no such option is added in their online platform. See the screenshot below, Not sure if they have only implemented such features in their retail store or not, but it's missing from the online platform.

### Reply 2:
The bigger problem i see is the increase of newbies just being introduced to custodial lightning without ever touching the chain, holding keys and running nodes. Getting thrown into custodian hands without proper education. Its indeed like having never used Bitcoin. Not offering on-chain transactions seems odd too, idk how this could still be counted as adoption.

Strike partnered with Bitnob, an African Bitcoin company to allow US customers to send USD to Africa with almost no fees.This is possible because the transfer of value is done through the lightning network, so the transfer is done almost immediately and with almost no fees.People can still continue to use their local fiat currencies, but the actual transfer is done through the lightning network in this case.The company charges a small fee for the conversion of USD->Bitcoin->Local fiat in Africa, but it's nowhere near the huge fees traditional banks charge for international money <truncated> are probably one of the biggest reason for people to use Bitcoin around the world, and Strike is using this to create a service around it. They are also planning to expand to other African countries.source: <link>

Ever since there has been the avenue to send bitcoin on the comfort of the mobile phone without internet starting from South Africa in the African Continent i know that this could bring more about it effective usefulness even with the introduction of lightening network as an addition, as long as it has the ease to cross boarder transactions and it high charges it's a solution in addition to the entire Africans and other continents to imbibe through.

### Reply 2:
This is truly a nice initiative and I'm happy seeing lightning doing this great work for the poor masses.I came across lightning on a centralized exchangePaxful precisely And i really enjoy the service and the fast service the offered.According to the OP, it seems this lightening are basically for fiat as stated by the OP and I hope the money sent can be converted to crypto if possible.I also do hope that they also do alot of marketing and adverts to create more awareness so that more people will get to know about their services too.

I learned a lot but since Im not a developer or involved on computer programming, I don't appreciate much the technical knowledge aside from key knowledge involved on blockchain.It will be helpful if you can provid the link to the event so that we can review the scope of topics and what the background of the speaker involved. This is crucial to determine the worth of that event.

maybe i will list this :1. the confirmation needs a time and can not be fast2. i can't trying to mining bitcoin because its need big hashrate to get profit3. still a few store online that accept bitcoin as payment4. i am not yet found a institution or any related bitcoin in offline or my city5. i can not get more reward from faucet because its too low for now6. i am having difficulty when i want to explain about bitcoin and i don't know how i can startedi think that is the main problem that i have until now.

1. Adoption can't be quick like all have speculated, even to see small changes in worldwide scenario it will require really long time and regarding bitcoin it is really new way to do financial transaction so people will need really long time to understand and start using bitcoin all over the world.2. There are many scam websites which also use other payment methods, so i don't think bitcoin should be blamed on this.3. Coinbase is centralized platform so they are not more than like paypal, bitcoin is designed to be used without any third party downloading own bitcoin wallet or electrum like desktop wallet will remove this types of problems with using coinbase.4. Why recurring payments is must? 5. Bitcoin transaction is transparent, better to say its untraceable which is one of the feature which add more value to use of bitcoin. It can't be removed or replaced.

Topic: South African Living in Rural Area to assess sustainable energy using Bitcoin
### Original post:
Sun Exchange, a clean energy company based on blockchain in South Africa, revealed an investment of $3 million from Arch Emerging Markets Partners. Sun Exchange is a peer-to-peer initiative in the field of solar energy. It enables users to use Bitcoin or South African fiat rand in rural areas to buy solar power.The CEO of the Sun Exchange, Abe explained that the reason why Bitcoin is chosen is because they need one universal payment system that enables micro transactions down to a millionth of a U.S. cent<link> is your opinion ?

### Reply 1:
If it is meant to help the poor people in South Africa then they need to give them the basic things to use those power, i am confused whether they are providing free electricity to the poor people to use bitcoin at a minimal rate but do these poor people have the resources to invest in bitcoin and start purchasing solar power, until there is a comparison between their power station charges and how much Sun is going to provide.Bitcoin for micro transaction . We need to wait for some major changes for that to happen.

### Reply 2:
This is another side of bitcoin adoption, hopefully some of the persons who will be paying with bitcoin sill not only use bitcoin as a means of payment but also an investment tool and a store of value. I see other competitors adopting same.

Topic: The good side of banning btc in Nigeria
### Original post:
We know that there are always two sides to a coin. I came to the reality that the decision of the Nigerian government is just a step to another good story to bitcoin adoption in Nigeria and more to the world. See the reasons I believe will create more adoption1. Regulation: Now that the SEC is talking tough, the government and senate may come with regulation in the Nigerian space anytime. If there is regulation to this effect, expect more investors because it means it has officially been legalized as many fear it wasn't a legal means of investment and earning before now.2. The news has created more publicity for bitcoin : If you are a Nigerian, you can see that more people are beginning to discuss the ban while others who don't know about bitcoin, they try to bring up a discussion of ""what the government banned"". This set of people that don't know about it but want to hear a discuss about it, they want to learn. They might have heard it before the ban or not but now that it is in public arena, they want to be tutored more. These are people who don't want to learn, people who only see it as what existed online, they will be the new converts3. People will now believe: Coming back to <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Also synonymous to most government. We know how many government is kicking against bitcoin, like China, India etc. So not only Nigeria. Bitcoin has been on this challenge for some countriesNot as such or total. We are yet to see a total regulation of bitcoin from any country because bitcoin is decentralized. In Nigeria, the government can only talk about regulating cryptocurrency accounts tied to the banks as that is even where the ban is facing at the moment.When ever it is officially legalized, you will get the information here on the forum. You seem not to understand this point. Sorry, what this point is saying here is if the government rescind the decision announced/ regulation the bank policy, it automatically means that more people will believe to invest. They will become new converts.

### Reply 2:
Maybe the timing of banning bitcoin is wrong, as people are seeing bitcoin so bullish, people will believe that the government took their opportunity to make money from bitcoin, maybe if they ban it when bitcoin is dumping, people would be convince that it's a good decision by the government to protect people from losing their money.

Topic: CRYPTOGLYPHS  A new way of imagining The Bitcoin Blockchain
### Original post:
Hello, it's been a while.Since August I've been developing ways of visualising the Bitcoin Blockchain. I wanted to gather its basic pieces and principles and present this in a way that could be interpretable to a broad audience of people. I struggled with getting such a complex system in two dimensions and keeping it visual, interesting, and fun. Then I intuitively connected it with the hieroglyphs of the ancient Egyptians and it soon connected together and made sense. I started working on my biggest crypto painting so far and finished it 6 weeks later.Below is the blueprint of the painting and I chose the Bitcoin forum as the place to present it in detail. This forum is the origin of Bitcoin evolution, I got help and tips here and now I want to contribute my share.The PurposeI designed this painting to be fun, thorough and illustrative. Primarily it can be used to explain how Bitcoin works, as the entire process of creating a new block is worked out in detail. Additional interpretation might be needed, but anyone with any knowledge can help or people can read my interpretation down below.For those already into crypto it introduces a fresh way of visualizing Bitcoin's Blockchain wi<rest of post truncated>

Topic: Not banned, yet not accepted
### Original post:
I might not have gotten the right caption for this post because I think I will do my best to explain it here.I've seen several threads talking about bitcoin not been banned in their country but yet they're not allowed to make any bitcoin related transactions through their local banks and this has really kept me puzzled lately about how people think because they still use bitcoin despite it's restrictions in their country makes it seem is not banned.Now my question is this, do you think because bitcoin is still widely in use in countries where it has alot of restrictions makes it not banned or people who use it are breaking some sort of law?In my country, there are strict rules against local banks not getting involved in cryptocurrency transactions which simply means that the government has banned all cryptocurrency transactions though local banks but yet people still think bitcoin isn't banned.So do you also agree that bitcoin can be said not be banned despite ban on local banks not getting involved with it?Please let's discuss as I would really want to hear the opinions of others about this.

### Reply 1:
There are several scenarios, a country could forbid the banks to process fiat transactions related to the trades of cryptocurrency because they don't have the needed infrastructure to combat money laundry, market manipulation etc, but they wouldn't put their citizens in jail if they are just ""holding/owning bitcoin"" or if they are getting paid in bitcoin. Another scenario is when a country forbids, mining, trading, accepting, paying and owning crypto in general because they are simply idiots.So when you are unable to easily buy and sell crypto by using your bank account is because idiots rule over you.

### Reply 2:
In my country the government requested all the banks to stop the transactions associated with cryptocurrency firms in the past. Even at that scenario people continued to use bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. There'll be ways possible and it is our interest to explore and find it. Later my country took away the ban, however their is no official <truncated> on the legality as well as on the regulation of cryptocurrency usage. Majority of the countries fall under this category, however it is the people understanding that lets them to be part of the innovation through technology.

Topic: Joe Bidens Crypto Impact Is Unclear As He Wins Presidency
### Original post:
Joe Bidens picks to head key regulatory agencies could redefine cryptocurrency policy in the coming years, although its unclear exactly how. The Associated Press declared on Saturday that Biden, the Democratic nominee, beat President Donald Trump, a first-term Republican in an election that was marked by division and the continued spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the former vice president didnt highlight crypto issues in his campaign, some of Bidens supporters hope he will advocate for reform on tech policies, while major companies are hoping to escape antitrust investigations.To be sure, at press time Trump had not conceded and protracted court challenges remain a possibility given the closeness of the race and the polarized environment.The price of bitcoin (BTC) was down more than 4%, dropping to $14,840.10.Close to three decades ago as a U.S. senator from Delaware, Biden introduced a pair of bills that would have outlawed encryption, inadvertently spurring the development of PGP keys. Biden has so far kept a tight lid on who his campaign will nominate to key positions, but his top pick to run the U.S. Treasury Department is reportedly Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
I agree, right now he's main priority is the pandemic and this is why he's already formed a task decision which needs to come up with a tangible plan for when he starts office in January. Cryptocurrency and quite understandably is not on his priority list. However, I'm slightly concerned about how he's going to approach crypto in the future as it is true that he is a democrat and not a young one either. By definition their opinion on something like BTC may sway in an unfavorable way, through what I guess might be legislation. Perhaps though the pandemic might lead to a different path given that the economy needs to recover quickly.

### Reply 2:
Crypto currency is far out of the president of the United State of Americas hands. Not only for the global reach of bitcoin but the chain of command. Bitcoin in the USA relies on the regulators that are far and far under the score of the POTUS. It's almost a whole different branch of government that rules on finical things related to crypto and the such. Sure there is probably some unrelated volatility because the change of the potus, however I wouldn't really expect any new regulations other then ones that push BTC forward (if perhaps to add my personal opinion it would be that btc rises as the feds will for sure print money even more and giant companies will pay more taxes rightfully)

Topic: Its not so Easy to lose in crypto trading and btc
### Original post:
Only way and most way are : You buy fomo and sell at correction. Thts the biggest way to lose. Also if you buy btc with any lower times any red day then youll just wait until you get better price to sell it. Dont invest what you can not afford to lose but invest what is small money enough for you( and you r not depend on it) that you can wait until you brake Even or profit. Otherwise its quite difficult to lose.

### Reply 1:
I agree with you because investing on what you don't have the perfect knowledge or basic knowledge is not really ideal because it can lead to negativity in life or negativity in area of concentration, now some people buy coins at cheaper rate which is approximately when the coin is low and immediately the coin rise they have to sell to make profit, so I would have prefer to purchase and hold for long time so that the profit will come in surplus form, and i noticed that people always perform these, that after purchasing a coin with higher rate and the coins happen to decrease in price, some people rush and sell, which is bad, if you buy a coin and the coin go down in price, if their is a spells money purchase more and hold because definitely it will rise again.

### Reply 2:
I'd found another way, just join the pump and dump group...they will help you to spend everything you have.I hope people would clearly understand the risk of trading and they should have to spend time studying this. We need to gain knowledge because that is the only tool that could help us to make a good decision. If we don't want to lose everything we have, then we should extend our effort make research, listen to other's advice, and never be in FOMO.

Last BTC will be mined on May 7th, 2140What else reason do you need to know that BTC is the future?I imagine 1 BTC might value then 50-100 Millions a coin, looking at the USD inflation rate.You might say that's too far away, but 1M a coin is something you can see in your lifetime.With BTC you have to think think medium to long term. Short-term thinking is your worst choice, don't have weak hands, you will regret later for cashing ""pennies"" now.

All other coins are copycats. Without BTC none would have existed.

### Reply 2:
I second your opinion! Limited supply and scarcity model is not the only driver of growth! Organic adoption and usability are also major players behind its growth in which we are currently lagging behind. Still we have a lot of countries where bitcoin is not legal or the legal status is confusing. These are bottlenecks towards organic growth which may (or may not) eventually sorted out in future. Also 50-100 million sounds like bit too much bullish, at least to me!

Topic: Why Bitcoin needs institutional money coming in?
### Original post:
I am just curious: Why do we need institutional money coming in to Bitcoin as if it is the one that can rescue Bitcoin from going down? Is this not an obvious sign that as a supposedly P2P currency Bitcoin is failing on this aspect? Bitcoin is supposed to be in the hands of the people and not with institutions, or so that is the impression I got by reading some articles about Bitcoin and it should be taking the many traditional institutions by storm, right? Now, I am seeing that it is the other way around. Please correct me if my impressions is really wrong. Or maybe I miss something here. But please don't insult my ignorance...

### Reply 1:
Don't trust the media. Just look for the facts they presented in the article. Most of the time they just quote opinion from one or two person and made it a headline. Take a look at how the narrative went before and after the bull run, and you'll see why you should not trust them. Look for the facts, ignore the opinions and headline.

### Reply 2:
Bitcoin doesn't need institutional money flowing in but everybody that owns Bitcoin wants the money to come in because their holdings would increase in value.Institutions which are primarily speculators only want profits and if they see that Bitcoin has enough liquidity and potential then they will get involved.This is basically two fold, it might provide a price increase however look what happened with the Bitcoin futures? It basically was the top and the start of the long bear market. This is why many people back in 2017 were worried and they were correct that they would short the market and cause a crash.

Topic: As expected THE LIAR, CLOWN 'John McAfee' backs down from $1M claim
### Original post:
If you know 'John McAfee' you probably know that he is a big liar! Once again, he proves it and proves it big time!He said time and time again in different interviews that, if BTC price doesn't get $1M by end of 2020, he will eat his D|ck live on tv. He explained time and time again as to why BTC will go to $1M. But as expected from a liar, he is now backing down from his claim. His tweet:""Eat my dick in 12 months?A ruse to onboard new users. It worked.Bitcoin was first. It's an ancient technology. All know it.Newer blockchains have privacy, smart contracts, distributed apps and more.Bitcoin is our future? Was the Model T the future of the automobile?""

### Reply 1:
Sincerely, how many of us actually believed him that he will actually do that.. on national television. Let's be serious. Of course that his actions were manipulative and his arrogance is beyond any limits but he's free to say whatever he wants on his public page. Nevertheless I don't agree with his statement that Bitcoin is ancient technology. Internet is not ancient technology, telephone is not ancient technology so why would Bitcoin and blockchain be that?The Bitcoin blockchain is very flexible and is a technological fountain. Many things can be built on and around it. LN and smart contracts are just small examples.

### Reply 2:
I didn't believe it too. I wouldn't really wanted to see someone eat a real dick on TV that would be grose. I'm still Mcaffee fan despite all the coins he supported that were actually scam. He is still one of the bitcoin supporter that made BTC popular. But considering BTC an ancient technology is just not right. I think he is not just fudding around anymore.

Topic: Using a lower bitcoin denomination(bits/sats/millibits): Which side are you on?
### Original post:
It's been quite a hot topic on crypto Twitter lately. With as far as I understand, for bitcoin to be seen as less ""expensive"" as it is, and to prevent people from being tricked and deceived into these so called ""cheaper"" coins like Ripplecoin, Litecoin, etc.Also,Regardless what your opinion is on this matter, I think it's a great topic for the forum. Feel free to express your opinions. Which side are you on, and why?Adam Back's reasoning(Tweet source: <link> conversations on Twitter you might be interested in:<link> will be self-moderating this topic to somewhat prevent unhelpful replies.

### Reply 1:
Of course. But the problem is for the newbies who get affected by the so called ""unit bias"", whereas they're mostly going to be more lured into altcoins because they're ""cheaper"". I know they should be doing their due diligence, but still.

### Reply 2:
It is right that bitcoin price can be high for newbies. But, if bitcoin is represented in satoshi, that will take away the name of bitcoin, also having a prefix of m (mbtc) does not still make any good sense because some newbies can still even think it is part of the ethereum wrapped tokens like wbtc, rbtc and the likes. Representing it with bitcoin is the best. When it is bitcoin, its price had risen all the way from $0.03 to $19000, so I do not think this should be a problem. Bitcoin also gotten to all time high this year, altcoins like ether, ripple, litecoin and so on have far behind getting to their all time high which indicates bitcoin to be the point of attraction. And come to think of it, newbies do not bother about price, they only prefer what is superior, the best and the one in vogue. Bitcoin is depicted as bitcoin while over 7500 other cryptocurrencies are known as altcoins, just because bitcoin has the marketcap that surpass all the whole altcoins. This indicate how bitcoin is so strong, and this is a reflection of the reasons why newbies still prefer to go for bitcoin. In my opinion, I do not see this as an issue.

Topic: Miners attempting cheating
### Original post:
Hi,Currently reading Parking Lewis stuff and there's one thing I cant seem to understand. It is in regard of honnest/dishonnest miners.I hear this many times in podcast and articles, the notion of ''high cost'' for miner going against the rules/consensus and being Rejected by the network.Here's what Parker says : The halvening is important not just because the supply of newly issued bitcoin is reduced, but also because it demonstrates that the economic incentives of the network continue to effectively coordinate and enforce the fixed supply of the currency on an entirely decentralized basis. If any miner attempts to cheat, it will be maximally penalized by the rest of the network. Nothing other than the economic incentives of the network coordinate this behavior; All I am trying to understand is this : Suppose that an entity manages to amass a huge amount of computional power. What happens when it is unmasked by the network's honnest nodes? Later in the game, the entity would not suffer huge lost if it finally decides to play by the rules and perform valid work, right ?***editedSource : <link>

### Reply 1:
Thank you Franky1, a lot of food for thought here !You did introduce some notions I was not aware about. This is clearer now. In short, as from my understanding now, and in a grossly simplified version, ''maximally penalized'' stands for Respect The Rules or Your block attemp will be reject

### Reply 2:
As franky1 has pointed out, there are certain rules that the miners have NO CONTROL over. For those rules, it doesn't matter how much computing power they can control. They could have 99.99% of all the block hashing power in the world, and if they tried to break any of those rules, ALL of the remaining 0.01% of the mining power AND the non-mining nodes, merchants, and users would simply ignore every block that they created. They'd have spent huge amounts of money to aquire their equipment, huge amounts of money on electricity to run the equipment, huge amounts of money on locations to store the equipment, and huge amounts of money to cool the equipment, and in return they'd get nothing.However, this doesn't mean there's nothing they could do with that computing power to have an effect on the Bitcoin system. It just means that there are certain things that they can't do (such as increase the amount of new bitcoin that gets created in each block or include transactions with invalid signatures in their block). Some malicious things that they COULD do if they control more Bitcoin hashing power than the rest of the world combined (at least until a significant number of Bitcoin participa<rest of post truncated>

Topic: Why would someone use an exchange to shift $1.2 Billion worth of bitcoins?
### Original post:
Do you think it is a coincidence that someone would transfer $1.2 Billion worth of bitcoin on a exchange for everyone to see? Normally such large transactions are done on OTC platforms, because people know what these kinds of dumps are doing to the price. The end result was a total of $5.3 Billion transacted in 24 hours <Triggered panic sell behaviour> Source : <link> observation was that this was done on purpose to trigger a drop in the price and it was done to discourage traders on Bakkt to buy Bitcoin futures contracts on the much publicized Bakkt platform. Whoever did this, knew exactly how institutional traders would react and they timed it perfectly with the launch of this platform. Are we seeing yet another attack from the Fiat masters to extinguish the Bitcoin wildfire

### Reply 1:
In my simple thought someone is behind this price drop and one of their strategy was to deposit a huge amount of bitcoin into an exchange. Possibly the purpose is that they want the market to go down so that they can buy more bitcoins at their disposal. Or possibly you are right that it is a strategy to discourage people to buy bitcoin futurescontract on bakkt. But let us hope that bitcoin will recover its value very soon and people will start to appreciate bitcoin futures contracts.

### Reply 2:
No offense, but Reddit does not seem like a trustworthy source of information. There's an image that looks like a screenshot, but it's not clear where was this mage even taken from. The name of the image led me to a possible source, a Russian news portal on cryptocurrencies called Prometheus: <link> Looking at the website's design, it could be a screenshot from their data even, but I cannot find anything like it anywhere but on the screenshot. We have no exchange, no transaction ID, no major websites talking about it. Taking all that into consideration, I'd assume it's either a fake or a bug.

Topic: Bye Bye Bitcoin
### Original post:
I opened my phone and turned on the Internet connection in it and I was bombarded by notifications, Gmail spams, Facebook notifications, Messenger chats and others but one thing that piqued my interest was this article in Google News. It talks about how bitcoin should be banned or something, I tried to read the whole article but I feel like it's just a rant about how bitcoin is worthless and the value of it is based on faith in reality it's the same as fiat, it's just that it's backed by the government that's why it has value, I mean if you go back to bronze age and you ask for a blacksmith to make you a sword and you pay the blacksmith a piece of paper telling the blacksmith that it has value, the blacksmith would probably laugh at you and just give you the sword for free since you aren't right on the head.Here's the link to that article: <link>

### Reply 1:
So many ads in this article. I try to read it and when read a couple of lines then ads popping up which discourages me to read all the articles. What I realize the article trying to say Bitcoin is not worth anything. This isn't new for us, many people already want to prove Bitcoin is worthless. But at the end of the day, nothing happens. Most likely no one can prove worthless Bitcoin. It will just exist as a dream. As much as a ban will happen, it will be more popular, doesn't matter price dump or pump, it's a different story.

### Reply 2:
+1Seriously, it was fine when six or seven years ago there were some self-proclaimed experts explaining how Bitcoin is untraceable and anonymous and hence the perfect tool for criminal activities. What really shocks me though is that sometimes on TV or in the newspapers there are still academics, like professors in economics, who talk the way about Bitcoin that newbies talked about it in 2012/2013. That's just shocking and concerning at the same time when you know these guys are giving economics classes.

Topic: How much crypto do you need ?
### Original post:
Hey guys. I made a short video discussing the topic of how much Bitcoin / Crypto do you really need ? <link> people don't plan their acquisition strategy , and that's why we have ""weak hands"" that sell when they shouldn't sell ( and regret it later ). Basically, I feel that its very important to have a target price range , a target investment amount , and then work towards that slowly to get to your goal. In the video I show you one way of possibly doing this.

### Reply 1:
I was one of those ""weak-handers"" when I first jumped in because the crypto winter during 2018 was so lengthy. I held the portfolios (alts) for like 6 months then sold them because things weren't improving much and I went in when the prices were at the bubble.

### Reply 2:
Thanks for sharing that video but I think it won't be accurate for all people in this crypto world, we have all different perceptions in life, different lifestyles, different ways of living and different statuses, and life. Well for me the crypto we need will be based on our contentment, if we know to ourselves that we are already contented to the bitcoin we have right now then I think that is how many cryptocurrencies we should have. My own contentment in life is when I had all of my dreams, having a bitcoin that will sustain all of my needs and wants, having a dream house, build my own company and cars.

Topic: Early signs of crime with bitcoin.
### Original post:
When the world is gradually accepting bitcoin, the already made bitcoiners are using those little opportunity to commit various crimes with bitcoin. A Russian was sentenced to French prison for bitcoin laundering.Source : <link> is also said that this is not his first crime using crypto currency.This are one of the reasons crypto is still rejected .What are your thoughts on these?.

### Reply 1:
Mate that was a personal motive, and does not reflect why Bitcoin is rejected in some countries. For me, the biggest issue/causes why Bitcoin was put on hold/rejected in some <truncated> is because of the regulatory issues/laws while some countries impose the ban on cryptocurrencies in order to protect their financial services/Finance base industry because they know already that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are more efficient compared to the old system that most countries have using. just my opinion!

### Reply 2:
Even if there is no Bitcoin, he can still carry out the laundering maybe through other means like fiat, or even art works, so the problems is not about Bitcoin being used the problem is from the individual and I think it is time we stopped using such case scenarios to judge Bitcoin and its use. Some people uses Bitcoin to carryout money laundering and some people are still building platforms which can also leverage Bitcoin as a payment option, Institutional investors are still buying it, thus means that irrespective of what negative thing people think about Bitcoin, it is now a valuable asset. Hence my thought is, just as fiat is being used for various purposes both good and bad purposes, and ever since then have not been rejected same is also the case with Bitcoin.

Topic: The Sanction On Mixers Would Make This Forum Boring
### Original post:
I just read the post by the admin stating that mixers will be banned on the forum from January 1. Considering that mixers and casinos seem to be the biggest advertisers here, I foresee a drop in revenue for the forum. The way I see it, it implies that the government is still in charge of the direction Bitcoin moves. If they cannot control Bitcoin, they can move against the appurtenances of the cryptocurrency: mixers, exchanges, who knows... even this forum, etc. With the popularity of the USD dwindling, who knows what else could happen to Bitcoin, the challenger? What do you think?

### Reply 1:
Forum admins or the forum does not make money from these campaigns. It's the forum members who make some money from their signature campaign. Some members may leave the forum, some others may become less active. But the forum will remain the same. [/quote]But they're making money from the forum? Don't believe they're working on humanitarian basis to promote Bitcoin

### Reply 2:
""The Sanction On Mixers Would Make This Forum Boring"" - bitcointalk was created for communication between BTC-like-minded people, and not for advertising mixers. Do you somehow imagine the purpose of this forum differently or has thi forum really changed so much that it is associated only with a place for making money on signatures (mixer campaign's). Even if something like this happens that the forum becomes boring (according to your version), then there will still be people here who want to discuss issues related to the bitcoin and a certain level of activity will be maintained.If some advertisers leave, others will come. This is far from the worst thing. Even if there are no advertisers at all, the forum administration must have reserves (donations, etc.) to keep the forum in working order.

Topic: J.K. Rowling, Author Of Harry Potter Is Interested in Bitcoin, Time To Short?
### Original post:
<link> is taking a big hit today, currently trading at $9,360 after briefly touching $9,800 in inter-day trading. Bears are back in town after the recent $10,000 rejection, however, the interest in Bitcoin seems to be growing.Legendary author, J.K. Rowling, has recently shown her interest in Bitcoin over Twitter.'

### Reply 1:
agree on this one, i think the same, halving need time to prove that supply is decreased and with the same demand, price should go up, and with the price increase, and eventual media coverage, new people will get in for profit, demand will rise again, and price will go up, until the circle is broken and we go down or sideways to new halving, it was a cyclic after first two halvings, will see if the will repeat, do not take this as investment advise

### Reply 2:
Perhaps it is good to hear that J.K. Rowling is interested in bitcoin. But it doesn't mean, that you need to short it right now. The whole economics of bitcoin is very different, and as we witnessed it being halved in the last couple of days, it makes it very rare, so it will be very valuable overtime. So it is better to HODL to our precious BTC and just wait for the eventually bull run. No need to short it at this time just because of a simple tweet.

Topic: I have a couple of questions...
### Original post:
Do all CPUs--no matter their strength--produce the same amount of coins at the same rate? If not, can I give the Bitcoin application the highest priority on a system and dedicate all of the CPUs power to Bitcoin production? Will this produce more coins compared to running the application normally?

### Reply 1:
No. For each SHA-256 hash you calculate, you get one chance of solving the block. Better CPUs can hash more data per second.It'll already use 100% of the CPU's capacity if nothing else wants to. Setting priority just says, ""If CPU resources are scarce, prefer the higher-priority program over the lower one.""

### Reply 2:
No. The BitCoins you receive for generating a block are a payment to you by the system for you work towards extending the block chain. You have invested money (by way of electricity and hardware wear) in the generation of the block chain, and are receiving compensation for that work.

Topic: Altcoin has surpassed Bitcoin after halving 2016 but this time will different
### Original post:
Bitcoin dropped as soon as the halving 2016 was completed. The rate has dropped from 98% to 94% in just five days after halving, meaning the combined value of altcoins tripled compared to BTC. Things can change quickly, but after just a few days, Bitcoin became the only notable cryptocurrency. Prior to that, in 2016, it seemed that there was a wild ride in the cryptocurrency space: millions of people were investing in random ICOs, Bitconnect launches and more. In short, investors are less educated about the risks of altcoin than now.When halving Bitcoin just a few days away, investors are aware of the fundamental power of Bitcoin outperforming altcoins, making it more likely that BTC will witness huge profits.Not to mention, the dominance of BTC is currently forming signs that it wants to rise higher from a technical perspectiveSo what do you think? Let me know your oppinion

### Reply 1:
Not again, investors have a basic knowledge of bitcoin today. And they all know that no altcoin will ever surpass it with their projects that's being proposed to them.The conclusion to this is the law of supply and demand. Rewards cut into halves and there's no other conclusion that it will lead but to the increase of bitcoin's price.

### Reply 2:
It is not possible for the situation to repeat itself. The price of BTC in 2016 was $ 1,000. Now the price is around 10k $. A moment ago ETH was chasing the BTC price. Now you can see that Bitcoin is king ..

Topic: PoW vs PoS
### Original post:
I know Bitcoin is running on a proof of work consensus algorithm. Recently I discovered proof of stake by reading up a bit on Cardano and Ethereum's 2.0 plans.What is the difference between these two, how does POS reduce the energy required to mine a block transaction and are either of these more secure than the other? Basically what are the pros and cons of each.Also if POS consumes less energy, then wouldn't it be a good idea for Bitcoin to transition to a POS algorithm?

### Reply 1:
Welcome to the community, I suggest you read the following threads below regarding the PoW vs PoS arguments it's pros and cons:POW vs. POSPoW vs PoS- Proof-of-Stake Might be the Winner here (Save the Environment)PoW vs PoS (Decentralized)PoW and PoS; Pros and Cons

### Reply 2:
In my own humble view, I think that the rise of electricity prices will not have considerable push-up effect on the price of BTC...the price is always determined by the market forces so it can go up and go down anytime and sometimes for no reason at all. Now, having said that, the electricity prices can affect mainly the profits that can be gained from Bitcoin mining just like any other business as this is a major expense. Right now, the USA has gained the top hand in BTC mining and not anymore China...this can certainly be exerting more demand for power and there is that talk to exploit wasted energy so they can be converted to cash rather than just have them released to the environment.

Topic: The cost of fast confirmation, OR, ""Turbo Mode""
### Original post:
I was thinking today about the cost of speeding up the time to get, say 5 blocks generated if one was impatient for a purchase to be confirmed.So, I rented a server at voxel.net, which claims to cost one third what amazon does, and I ran bitcoin for a bit to see what it could do there, per core.Results: about 1000 kh/s per core. (Note, I expected double or triple based on their marketing. Some tuning could probably be done here.)Incidentally, this implies cost per minted BTC of (at current difficulty of 354): $.1/hr for roughly 17.5 days = $42 per 50 BC = $.84 per BTC. Ouch!But, let's imagine I want to double up the speed of the network to get my transaction going quickly. I would then need approximately 2.5 million kh/s, or about 2,500 servers. This would get me roughly one block per 10 minutes. Combined with the rest of the network, we'd be double-timing blocks, or getting one out every five minutes. Of course, I'd only need to do this for about 25 minutes to get my five blocks.So, 2,500 servers * .42 hours = 1,041 hours * $.10 = $104.10. Less the current value of the 250 BTC at $.06 = -$15: Net cost is $90 to get the transaction sped up.If you wanted the confirmation in 10 minut<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Adjustment is limited at 400% (up or down)Or you could just pay the seller the extra $300 to ship you the goods 'early'.If they want to do that that is fine. I don't understand why you'd want to do it.The system is pretty good at adjusting to in/out flow of computer power.

### Reply 2:
Well, speed is always desirable for a purchaser and deliverer of X item, please refer to Escrow discussions here among others for some reference: being sure that the transfer is 'real' takes time, and for the two parties in a transaction, they almost always want that assurance immediately.The hosting person could just as easily take BTC as dollars, so I don't think that's the point, really.Regarding ""Screwing with the network"" Yes, it would be annoying for everyone to have to wait 40 minutes per block for 8 weeks if someone had burned through 2016 blocks quite quickly previously. Since BTC aren't economically viable to generate on US server farms right now, this is likely just an 'attack' vector, not a 'money-making' vector, at least without the added payments for speeding things up.

Topic: Leaving Bitcoin as inheritance
### Original post:
If I die, my family can use my death certificate to rescue all my money from bank and appropriate all my posses. But not bitcoin, I was thinking about how to leave bitcoins as inheritence in a safe way, minimizing risks of be stolen by my own family (still if I trust my family, they can store improperly the keys and be stolen, or forced to deliver).The perfect solution, in my opinion, is a mechanism whithout intervention that reveal my keys to my family, this could be done if I do not access some service for a month, or if I don't store some stuff in the blockchain for a month or ... I don't know a solution. And only my family could access my keys, possibly they have keys that allow then to access my keys.An good solution could be some artifact, like a file, that I can send to my family, or left it stored online and thar artifact could reveal my keys only to my family.My basic ideia is:1 - Encript the keys with your password, but must be a very strong password, resilient to brute force atack.2 - Print the encripted keys in paper or some more durable medium and store securely in your home.3 - Reveal to your family a limited set of characters with wich they can sucefuly find the pass<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
I love the idea of a mechanism making sure that there should be proper and proven way of delivering Bitcoin as an inheritance in case something will happen bad to its original owner. I understand that there are some platforms offering such services though I am not sure if they are really safe and will deliver according to their promises. This is actually interesting.

If you want to give a bitcoin as an inheritance to your family it is better if you do not make too much security progress to your account because some of them does not know what you are doing at the same time they did not know all the things you are stating on the account and they need to ask other people to do this instead. I'm suggesting it is better if you withdraw those funds immediately so they can use but if you don't want and just stay into the bitcoin it is better if you give already the wallet username and password to your wallet so they can immediately use your bitcoin funds. If you still have some time it is better to teach them immediately because they have some insights on how does the transaction of the bitcoin works it depends on your if you will before you die or let them explore the transactions before they'll get your funds.

Topic: Reasons to fork bitcoin in the future?
### Original post:
Is there any issues with bitcoin to fork it when they become a problem? why not find all the reasons that might require a fork some day and only fork it once and not few times?

### Reply 1:
do you mean to fork bitcoin or to fork blockchain? and then if there is copy of it, what next? I am not really sure about that. probably it will be good idea sometimes to separate between two groups when a problem comes. so how do you separate between two groups who will use original one and copy of it?

### Reply 2:
dude,what if i told you bitcoin already have forks? lots of these altcoins are a bitcoins fork.if you are talking about the real bitcoin being forked and used, well, the problem is the adoption. to fork bitcoin doing some changes to the code, if only a few nodes follow you, your fork dies.

Topic: Big news for BTC exposure and adoption!
### Original post:
Great news for spreading info about BTC!<link> when the logo will be shown, more and more people will know about it.

### Reply 1:
This can, of course, help Bitcoin to gain more interest from the people as this can be a big exposure. Though we should not expect that this can be sort of like a magic wand. Building a brand that people can trust can take some time and in many cases big businesses utilized millions of dollars just to advertise their names to the masses. We can only hope that more and more will sponsor to have the name Bitcoin plastered in events sports or entertainment.

This is one more step... all around BTC is entering our lives... German Bruger King, BTC ATM's and now football... it will not take long for everyone to be able to choose the format of their monthly wage...I feel that the whales are getting ready for another serious run...

Just wondering how many people are using what versions. Also, please note that I intend to drop support for (only) the 0.5.0.x branch when 0.6.0 is released, so if you're using that please upgrade to 0.5.3.1. If you're using a broken or insecure version, please comment on this thread why. I would also appreciate comments on how long you intend to use which versions. Thanks!Edit: If you run git master, that counts as 0.6 RCs

### Reply 1:
If you thought that he is tracking you or watching you, why not use a new wallet and transfer your fund to a new one. This kind of technique dusting is usually used for monitoring of potential victim. Yes this is possibly trying to hack you or follow your assets on your wallet.

### Reply 2:
It's trivial to get a list of all BTC addresses with funds in them or addresses with greater then 'x' amount in them.After that some people send dust to those addresses so if you move it all at once they can see where it goes.Other times they hope you look at the transaction to see a message.Take this one:<link> to 389 addresses but the beginning transactions have a web site. letsfullofsea . topicNo idea what is there and not going to check, but I bet some of those 380+ people did.-Dave

Topic: Bitcoin is decentralized.Really?!
### Original post:
I know that decentralized currency means that no central bank can control the money supply.But what if 2-3 major players own 40-50% of all the bitcoins.Do you still think that the currrency is ""decentralized"" if 2 or 5 or even 10 big players can control the btc pricejust by selling and buying large amounts of bitcoins.What do you think about that?

### Reply 1:
Yes, it's decentralized. The system is. It doesn't matter about how much you own, what could make the system centralised iis if one miner has control of 51% or more of the mining Power, or if a group/entity had this power.

### Reply 2:
As far as i know the biggest play has about 5% so this is not worrisome and i am sure we will be fine in the future.More concerning would be a miner with 51% mining power, which already happened before with mining pools if i remember correctly.But the community corrects this situations usually very quickly, since it is not good for anybody. Not even for the 51% miner since he is at risk loosing all because of bitcoin using its value.

### Original post:
Kevin Lee a mixed metal fighter recently sign a contract with a Russian base Eagle fighting Champion and Lee will be getting paid in Bitcoin, Kevin Lee expressed his excitement of the part of the contract that states he will be getting paid in Bitcoin because payment in Bitcoin will not give him push back. Is also on record that the champion has been a Bitcoin holder for some years now.The amount to be paid in BTC by Eagle FC was not disclosed but is expected to be somewhere around $280,000= 5.86 Bitcoin or more for slated fights. Source<link>

### Reply 1:
I was confused what I was reading at first. I was like ""wth is a metal fighter?"" hehe.Illegal substance apparently. It's mentioned in the article shared in the topic......Anyone familiar with contracts explain to me what does he mean by ""not give me any pushback on it"". Does this mean there will be no cuts or taxes deducted from his pay?

### Reply 2:
Taxes would be paid once the coins get converted to fiat. But that's not what he meant with pushback, I think. He was probably trying to say that the Eagle FC organization was not causing problems and showing a negative stance towards him for wanting to receive his fees and salary in Bitcoin. He might have attempted to land a similar deal elsewhere, and ran into problems because he wanted Bitcoin.

You can use 1 satoshi as a tx fee even right now. Of course you could in the future.

### Reply 2:
Fee is always adjusted with bitcoin price and it is not sure in which direction bitcoin price will go so 20k satoshi will not remain as fee. IF bitcoin goto 100k$ as you said price will be adjusted to around 1k satoshi i think.

Topic: When will the Fiat slaves from Old school Investment companies get Bitcoin?
### Original post:
I recently read an article written by a Chief Financial Officer at a large and well known investment firm and the writer just do not get it. I will quote his argument and our (Crypto investors) answer below :1. Bitcoin and other Crypto coins are not approved by financial institutions regulators Answer : We do not care, Bitcoin was supposed to be an alternative payment option to the old traditional (regulated) Fiat options. 2. Bitcoin and other Crypto coins are mostly used for criminal use. Answer : Really? So what did criminals use before Crypto currencies existed? Most financial crimes (and other) ...still involve cash. 3. Currencies are usually considered as a payment method, not an investment. Answer : Forex - Need I say more?4. Bitcoin does not have the safety net from government oversight. Answer : How many of the previous Bubbles was prevented by government oversight? (Tech Bubble / Property Bubble..... ) They could care less, if it collapse, they just want their taxes.5. Wealth Managers (intermediaries) does not exist in Crypto currencies. So there is no licensed and accredited advisors in this space. Answer : Yes, this is exactly what Crypto currency investors want.... No 3<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
The major bottleneck here is the government regulation. In majority of the countries, bitcoin has not yet received any formal approval from the regulatory bodies. Since the corporates are legal entities, they simply don't dare to stay at the wrong side of the legal system. So unless and until governments come up with a favorable regulation, we won't see a lot of companies jumping into this bandwagon. Also another trouble for publicly listed companies are that they need to get a nod from the shareholders before they can jump into such investment. That's another pain area. Hopefully we will see more companies in the cryptospace soon but that would further centralize the cryptocurrency and the game can then be controlled by the corporates. Not really a desirable situation fo4 commoners like us!

### Reply 2:
The fiat slaves will get bitcoin only when their masters order them to do so. These masters are the mainstream media, big corporations, influent politicians, philanthropists... And they aren't going to send their slaves to bitcoin universe before guaranteeing its a profitable and fertile place for themselves. Profitability and fertility that can be only achieved through regulations and more regulations, as they were always used to and benefited in the old school model.It means slaves will be always slaves, in fiat or bitcoin universe. But actually they don't care, because first of all slaves have and want to please their masters with excellency. If the masters are happy, the slaves will be happy too.

Topic: Mobile money slowly turning East Africa into cashless society
### Original post:
<link> Africa summit: Someone from Bitcoin should go there...<link> frequent comment I hear, particularly from international banks, is that the unbanked arent for them.""<link>

### Reply 1:
Africa is certainly prime for the picking. Mobile SMS text messaging money transfers are the norm over there.Bitcoin could certainly make a splash.

### Reply 2:
How does Mobile SMS money transfer work in Africa? There must be some gateway to an account entry system for that to work. A gateway to initiate and verify Bitcoin transactions should be possible in the same way. That would enable Bitcoin payment with out local access to the internet. You would lose some decentralization by using a gateway, but there could be competition among gateways. I also assume transactions would be denominated in BTC, otherwise there would have to be some way to determine the current exchange rate with local or international fiat currency.I can image a scenario like the following (assumes an android device):1) person 1 wants to pay person 2 in BTC2) person 2 generates a public address on their phone and sends it to person 1 (via bluetooth, camera scan, local wifi, etc.)3) person 1 generates signed transfer from their wallet to person 2's public address and sends it to person 2 (via bluetooth, camera scan, local wifi, etc.)4) person 2 verifies terms of the transfer and sends an SMS with the signed transfer to the Bitcoin gateway5) the Bitcoin gateway posts the signed transfer to the Bitcoin network and waits for some predetermined number of confirms or reject<rest of post truncated>

Topic: Proposals for global shutdown of crypto
### Original post:
The goal would be to end the ecoonomic destruction of bitcoin / crypto while causing the least losses possible to public.Ideas on how to shut this endless crashing garbage down safely?

### Reply 1:
NO need to destroy btc mining hardware, it becomes worthless through hasrate increase or price drops. There is no old btc mining hardware really. IF btc rises the old hardware is obsolete, if btc falls the old hardware is obsolete.The mining hardware like most tech self destructs by market forces. I was more considering how to begin to protect people and close off the almost guaranteed losses that come with btc pricing

### Reply 2:
how about eliminate all onramps to btc. just eliminating the one click and lose simplicity of the btc scam would stop most people from getting hurt, right?as you can see I am a newbie. you are a legend. Would you say there is a coin counting market making algo that makes bitcoin always drop when people buy?

Topic: Bitcoin Halving - here's the math
### Original post:
The Bitcoin system has been designed so that the reward for mining a block is halved after every 210000 blocks. When block 0 (also known as the genesis block) was mined in early 2009 it was 50 BTC (five billion satoshi) <link> first halving took place on reaching block 210000 towards the end of 2012, after which the reward for mining a block became 25BTC (2.5 billion satoshi) <link> It remains at this value today and will continue untill reaching block 419999. From block 420000 the reward will be 12.5 BTC.It is generally mentioned that the total bitcoins that will ever be mined is approximately 21 million BTC. The math involved here uses geometric progressions (GP) . This is an ordered sequence of numbers where each number (or term) is obtained by multiplying the previous number by a fixed amount. e.g. consider the sequence 1,2,4,8,... here the fixed amount is 2. This is known as the common ratio of the geometric progression and is referred to by the letter 'r'. The letter 'a' is used to refer to the first term of a GP. So for the above GP a = 1 and r = 2.If the common ratio (r) is a fractional value less than 1, this results in a GP where the terms decrease. e.g. <truncated> is a <rest of post truncated>

A lot and usefull information you letting me know about all prediction and period in just one single post,well the concept of bitcoin distribution its amazing,and at the moment all people know thats there is a limit till 2140 but the question is what will happen in 2041 as the mine will be over,miners wont turn off,otherwise the security of bitcoin would be lost.

### Reply 2:
The prediction of halving dates is based on an average block time of 10 minutes. So far the block time is almost all <10 min. Therefore the estimate of 2140 will come earlier if bitcoin keep on growing.

Topic: No..China Does NOT Have 0% of the Hashrate
### Original post:
If you recall back months ago, news outlets were touting headlines regarding China having a 0% share of the global hashrate. <link> the University of Cambridge's Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index shows that China is not mining anything.<link> I had first heard this news I was quite skeptical. I just couldn't believe that there was nobody mining bitcoin within China's borders. Data from a Chinese cybersecurity company Qihoo 360 estimates an average of 109,000 bitcoin mining IP addresses active daily in China. This is a whole lot more than zero. The miners that remain, though, are smaller-scale projects that did not find it feasible to just pick up and leave. They did not have the luxury of packing up on a helicopter and shipping their operation to Kazakhstan as did many of the larger-scale miners did.The same cybersecurity company also stated that as much as 20% of the worlds bitcoin miners are estimated to still operate within China. The provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Shandong are where the majority of these miners reside. Or at least that's where the connections are being made from. I struggle to imagine the amount of hoops such operators would have t<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Back then, when these numbers first came out, I've told that the IPs can be spoofed and the ""others"" can be anything (and it's big).That ""Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index"" has so much potential for being inaccurate it practically misleads everybody.So indeed, I never believed China's hash rate dropped to 0.On the other hand, it does show that the bulk of miners have moved or hide their tracks, hence there's no official mining in China, hence their political declarations should have low impact in bitcoin's price and evolution (unless they're unban it again, of course).There are a lot of opinions in the other topic that may worth reading: <link>

### Reply 2:
So, how come Chinese cybersecurity company Qihoo 360 can guess there are 109,000 bitcoin mining IP addresses active and the Chinese government, authoritarian as it is, does nothing?I understand that most will be trying to camouflage via vpn or Tor but if that company can do that estimate I find it hard to believe that the Chinese government can't do the same and act accordingly.

Topic: Why Bitcoin is different from other means of investment
### Original post:
Even though some people will argue that Bitcoin was not created primarily as a means of investment, it has become obvious that Bitcoin presents a good investment opportunity. Many people even use Bitcoin as a hedge against fiat is plagued by inflation. One aspect that have created much argument is real estate with many saying it is more reliable than Bitcoin that they claim is risky. I know several threads have been made in this regards with most of them moribund. I created this post because I feel so bad regarding what happened in my country. As you can see in this post and the video in it, the state government demolished an entire estate with several buildings and properties inside. This is peoples investment that just got destroyed. This was a property approved by previous administration but demolished by new <truncated> risk many people do not put into consideration in real estate and some other physical investments. This is a confirmation that Bitcoin is safer and better than many conventional investment portfolios. Anyone still doubting the freedom, comfort and peace that Bitcoin offers is probably yet to embrace reality.

### Reply 1:
Buddy, there are many ways people also lose their BTC keys and find their wallet empty the next minute; i don't know what confirmation you are talking about here, neither do i know the story behind the link you shared, but real estate is a far less risky investment than BTC. Though every investment has its own risks, but some are more risky than others, take note that to be your own bank is a risk in itself and that's why a lot of people screw up and lose their coins.Posting one link of people losing their investment in real estate is not a confirmation of anything, at least without comparing it to the number of people who have lost their BTC's, either through hacks, malware, centralized exchanges, lending and earning platforms; etc.

### Reply 2:
Satoshi Nakamoto did not create Bitcoin as an asset against fiat currencies or central bank digital currencies CBDCs or investment asset. Initially it is designed as a peer-to-peer electronic cash, that's it. That is the most basic we must know and if Bitcoin loses this usability, it will no longer interested.Other usability of Bitcoin is like derivatives that blossom with time and with more adoption for Bitcoin, we will see more claims on more new usability in future.

Topic: Many great things are banned, censored or restricted in China. If China wants to
### Original post:
Just to name a <truncated> the PoohAlice in WonderlandEven though these things are banned in China, they are thriving in the rest of the world.If China wants to crackdown Bitcoin mining activities, miners will go elsewhere. This is actually a good thing for cryptocurrencies, as it shouldnt be under a decentralised, power-obsessed regime. China can play with its digital yuan.

### Reply 1:
Well that explains why the Chinese are still sane while the rest of the planet has gone mad.

### Reply 2:
It is not that simple. Chinese manufacturers account for 95% or more of the mining equipment supply. China will have a monopoly in the mining sector as long as this situation continues. Importing mining equipment from China to some other country is hugely expensive. And this is the reason why the mining farms in other countries are just in break-even financial situation, while those in China are very profitable. I have mentioned about this several times in the past. It is one of those issues which doesn't have an immediate resolution.

Im rather curious about what are the best Crypto sites to trade Cryptocurrency & if they have a mobile application because my PC has broken down recently and I currently have only my smartphone (iPhone) with me right now that I can use in order to trade cryptocurrency.

Almost all exchanges have an APK on Android, You simply type it in Playstore according to the exchange you are looking for, I myself use a lot of apk but only for analysis, such as drakdoo, tradingview, bitcoin trading signals, You can also enter your trading account.

### Reply 2:
Almost every exchange is available in mobile version which you can use based on your need and the type of coins you want to trade I would suggest to go for Binance I have used it in Android version and it's user friendly and handy to trade especially automated trading during the fluctuations. It's also available for IOS version as well. You can use the following link to check the details and download it.<link>

Topic: Possibility to pay with Bitcoin, Etherium and Ripple by Canadian lending company

The notion that cryptocurrencies are not used as a method of payment is still diminishing, as many companies have recently made it possible to make payments with cryptocurrencies in transactions.

Isn't Canadian Central Bank issued a banking ban on crypto few years back?? Or is it incorrect information? Can anyone confirm?If there is a banking ban on cryptos in Canada, I am not sure how this company will accept payments in cryptocurrencies! The borrowers should not land into legal troubles later on! That might create more troubles for cryptos in Canada instead of helping in adoption. If it finally becomes a reality, then it will be great in terms of mass adoption - another strong push!

### Reply 2:
This is an interesting piece of news especially for the crypto community. One of the major limiting factor in the adoption of crypto in the mainstream world is the belief that cryptocurrencies can not be used as a means of payment.Now, quite a lot of companies are accepting bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies just like tesla and this broker company. Trust me, quite a lot of companies will follow in this footsteps and very soon, nearly all companies will adopt bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in their payment method.

Topic: [LIST] Bech32 Bitcoin addresses Not supported
### Original post:
Bech32 or Native Segwit addresses (starting with bc1) are getting more popular and growing in numbers every day because of smaller size and cheaper fees for transactions. (Full Bech32 stats HERE.)Native Segwit adoption is on the rise and many wallets and exchanges are supporting it, but not all of them.I will list and keep updated here all (lazy) exchanges and wallets and other services not (fully) supporting Bech32:|Wallet|Send <truncated> <truncated> Services|Send <truncated> to: Allow sending to bech32 <truncated> Allow generation and receiving to bech32 addresses?*NOTE: You can always send Bitcoins from a bech32 to any Bitcoin address format.*Update is in progress and main source1, source2 and source3 may be outdated.If you know know any other exchange, website, service, casino or wallet not supporting Bech32 address format please post it here, and please correct me if you see any mistake.

### Reply 1:
Bread wallet fully supports bech32 since 2018 according to their tweet <link> post from reddit that uses the same wiki source proves it <link> weird that Jameson Lopp talks about native segwit yet his Casa wallet doesn't fully support it. Is he waiting for Taproot and Schnorr based on this tweet <link>

### Reply 2:
Are all the problems technical (lazy exchanges and wallets,) or did Bech32 addresses have some problems as there was no specific standard for signing the message.Also, not updating does not mean that they are lazy, but they may not want that, as many of these platforms promote altcoins, and therefore it is in their interest to keep fees slightly high so that there is a logical reason for using altcoins.

Topic: Bitcoin and its History
### Original post:
Insightful blog for Bitcoin, we can get the overview knowledge of history of bitcoin. The world is becoming ever more contingent on the internet. So its no surprise that Bitcoin, a globally secured online version of cash has claimed the interest of investors, but not many shops accept Bitcoin yet and some countries have banned it altogether.Bitcoin is a valuable crypto coin because people are ready to exchange them for real goods and services, it can be bought by using both fiat and altcoins, or can also be generated by using a computer which is called mining.

### Reply 1:
I thought you would tell us history. Maybe many people don't think about the history of Bitcoin. Most of them make predictions for the future of bitcoin. Maybe this article is suitable for beginners like me as a learning. Basically, many of them think that using history is only to connect the effects that will occur.

### Reply 2:
History will become only history and lesson for others. However bitcoin become a trend and pioneer for decentralized digital asset. Before bitcoin became famous like today there are also some digital asset but can not survive until now

Topic: Is Bitcoin halal?
### Original post:
With Muslims making up a quarter of the world's population, a clear consensus on the Islamic view of Bitcoin has global implications.In briefThe use of Bitcoin under Islamic law has been a topic of discussion in recent years, as many Muslims worry that Bitcoin investments may be haram.According to recent scholarly interpretations, most general uses for Bitcoin are considered to be permitted in Islam.However, gambling, lending, and some kinds of trading with cryptocurrency are almost certainly forbidden.Whether or not Bitcoin is halal has been a point of contention for many Muslims, as well as several Islamic banks and financial authorities in recent years.This has left many Muslims worried about investing in <truncated> during times of extreme growthsince they couldn't be sure whether the appreciation of their investment would be considered haram (forbidden) or halal (permissible) under Islamic law.With around 1.9 billion Muslims in the world, equivalent to almost a quarter of the world's population, a clear consensus on the Islamic view of Bitcoin could be a major boon for adoption.Bitcoin is (mostly) halal, say scholarsAccording to Islamic Law, there are a number of criteria that<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
In my opinion, your topic is the area of syara, which is about certain religious laws. I will not be able to say halal or haram, because this is not my area that we legally control based on religion. and your questions must be answered by religious leaders. whereas here we are not.so for legal matters in religion, I'd better keep it. and I'm ready to listen carefully.

### Reply 2:
You should have posted the source for this.I'll be doing this for you: <link> an older news, and back then more were telling that Bitcoin is haram.But their logic is flawed, they clearly don't understand Bitcoin and were misled by how media was presenting Bitcoin, hence I expect that this view is bound to change over time.As in quite a number of dilemmas related to religion, this too depends a lot by who are you asking (and it doesn't matter how big authority he is) and when (people's understanding usually evolves in time).

Topic: Do you honestly think Bitcoin toys would help us?!
### Original post:
This post is actually in reference to another post. It's really hard to take it serious for some reason. In theory it sounds rather meaningful but I don't really think it can be useful in any way. This person didn't actually suggest toys based on Bitcoin, but it actually made me go from their point to this one. Do you really think toys based on Bitcoin could be utilized to actually raise our children to be educated on the currency? Do you think they'd actually enjoy the toys? Do you think they can actually grasp what Bitcoin even is? I just feel like trying to teach small children anything huge and confusing is a bad idea because children naturally have undeveloped mindsets to not even be able to grasp what certain things mean. That's why you can't sue children, that's why children don't have jobs and that's why children can't drive.Curious though, if you wanted to invent a Bitcoin toy, what would you make?

### Reply 1:
Why would you say that though? What is your reasoning for that? I don't know of any children using this site. It's mostly adults.

### Reply 2:
I think bitcoin toys would help us introduce bitcoin to people. I mean people will notice the toy and find a information about what is bitcoin. And kids will ask they parents what is bitcoin.

Topic: Satoshi Nakamoto Apparent Author of Two Upcoming Books on Amazon
### Original post:
It is not every day that we enter some news site related to bitcoin and we come across this image:and this title: Satoshi Nakamoto Apparent Author of Two Upcoming Books on Amazonwith so many fake satoshi that appeared this year...it looks like 2019 will be the year where Satoshi Nakamoto finally leaves the hole where it's hidden

### Reply 1:
I can write a book (I am a shit writer by the way) and publish it using the name Satoshi Nakamoto instead of Royse777 :-PYou guys will then start reading my book thinking it came from the Bitcoin inventor. :-DNo one can be Satoshi just because they name something using this name. The real Satoshi will use cryptographic evidence to prove his authenticity.

### Reply 2:
Seems like everyone wants to take a bite of the Satoshi craze and milk some penny off of it. I won't find it surprising if a lot of claims to be Satoshi spring out of nowhere in the latter part of 2019 when bitcoin's price has gone full blown for people to use it to ruse people off of their money. Well one guy is an outstanding fail in impersonating the true Satoshi and even made it to headlines and hopefully, in courts for his legal misadventures and whatnot (hi CSW). I just hope most of them end up there.

Topic: Bitcoin mixer or anonymous altcoin(xmr, dash), which is more anonymous?
### Original post:
Hello guys, I just joint a bitcoin mixer campaign, I am new to bitcoin mixer service, and very curious about this. My question is: Bitcoin mixer or anonymous altcoin(such as xmr, dash), which is more anonymous?PS: feel free to click my signature to mix your bitcoin with only 1% fee.

### Reply 1:
Dash and xmr should be more anon, you can see bitcoin mixers fees, very high, people prefer buy dash or xmr, and buy in the darknet market.

### Reply 2:
Bitcoin mixer could be maybe somewhat traceable if you're dedicated enough and have the time and resources, however it is difficult and doesn't really yield a decent result most of the time.XMR or some similar crypto is probably more anonymous, however I don't know the ins and outs technically speaking so my information is borderline useless for this.

Topic: The first country in the world. Officially salary in cryptocurrency!
### Original post:
In New Zealand, from September 1, people will be able to get paid in cryptocurrency! This permission applies only to employees, the established salary will be paid only at a fixed rate, but this does not apply to premiums and dividends. Freelancers and self-employed workers were not included in the permit.The tax authorities of this country have set the condition that the chosen digital money will be pegged to one of the paper currencies (New Zealand dollar). So that this salary in cryptocurrency can be converted into a standard form of payment, and also vice versa, for paying taxes. Therefore, the employer needs to pay salaries to employees, only liquid cryptocurrency, tied to the rate of fiat money.Would you like to get paid in cryptocurrency?

### Reply 1:
The same thing I have seen in the last few weeks, about Scotland paying salaries in crypto.Example:1. <link> <link> <link> this does not apply in my country, even though now 1,700 people in my country are already familiar with Bitcoin.But from another point of view, the government does not forbid and not order, every bitcoin user.I also hope that this can happen in my country, going forward, hopefully.

### Reply 2:
Does Japan not the first? Which few years ago, japan legalized bitcoin and considered Bitcoin as a legal money on their country. Btw, it's nothing to do who's first who officialy legalized Bitcoin on every country, as long as Bitcoin continue to grow and mass adoption too. Glad to hear this positive news for Bitcoin

Today I read about the news of El Salvador bitcoin hodling investment yielding about 40% profit and i had to imagine that 40% in figures in contrast to the amount of dollars El Salvador hold in BTC. But nevertheless, this is not the main issue I wish to focus on in this thread, I just want to divert a little.Sometimes back when bitcoin price was that low ($16k) a few investors if not many felt discouraged with a flinching desire to sell in fears that the price might keep getting low and addition to the lies and negative rumors from bitcoin haters about bitcoin falling further low even to zero, these lies made many bitcoin holders to hurriedly sell even at a lost.El Salvador President, Bukele was exempted, critics made a lot of noise in the media with many articles about El Salvador's bitcoin investment heading to a loss but the Salvadoran President didn't deter in his resolute not to sell but resolved to keep holding not listening to all the critics. Today El Salvador is 40% in profit in their bitcoin investment as bitcoin price keeps rising, 40% when the halving has yet occured, and the next ATH not yet hit, how much more when it all does.I think all bitcoin investors needs to tak<rest of post truncated>

Well, if the amount of capital in El Salvador is 1 billion dollars and it has grown by 40%, it has a profit of 400 million dollars.Honestly speaking, it's too big. Just holding the $1 billion capital fund and then immediately making a profit of 40%this is not a joke. But this is just an example.Apparently, this is what happens when we hold a long-term asset like Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. That's why Bitcoin is really proven and tested for long-term investment. And this is what the whale investors who enter this business industry field want.

President Bukele is a crypto-friendly hero who is hated by so called demon-has-gone democrazy lovers and Berkshire Hathaway shareholders for obvious reasons. His haters will naturally disappear soon after biting the dust.

Topic: JP Morgan once again trying to spread prevent mainstream adoption of Bitcoin
### Original post:
A few days back, there was a statement from some of the JPM executives. <link> they are trying to dissuade corporations from converting some of their cash reserves to Bitcoin, claiming that it will increase the volatility. According to JPM, corporate treasury portfolios typically have a volatility of less than 1% per year, and the addition of Bitcoin can increase the volatility from 1% to 8%. Let's examine both parts of the statement. The first part claims that corporate treasury portfolios are comprised of low-volatile assets and the typical volatility range is 0% to 1% per year. Is this true? Obviously not. The M1 supply within the United States have risen by almost 50% during the last 12 months. Along with that, we can expect a proportional decrease in the purchasing power of the US Dollar. So these corporate portfolios are actually witnessing an erosion in their net worth, although they are hidden because only the USD value is being considered. I would say that after taking these factors in to consideration, the depreciation of the portfolio can be -10% per year or even higher. Now let's examine the second part of their claim. According to JP Morgan, if Bitcoin comprises 1% of <rest of post truncated>

They want people to use their crypto products, think of them behaving just like ripple team, ripple has always been very critical on bitcoin.

### Reply 2:
JP Morgan successfully spred Fuds and played with bitcoin price in the years of bear market from 2018 to end of 2019. Since 2020 and now, the bitcoin adoption has been risen with institutional investments and they as institutes will make their decisions on their investigations. They don't rely or will be affected by fuds from JP Morgan. Retails have more good than bad to follow general trend of institutes and skip fuds from JP Morgan.Bitcoin adoption won't be prevented by JP Morgan and the bull run of bitcoin won't be halted or stopped by JP Morgan.

Arias purchased bitcoins from Espinoza multiple times and then escalated the investigation when he purchased $30,000 USD worth of bitcoin.<link>

When bitcoin traders are treated on par with drug dealers there is something wrong with the society. I don't think we have to rely on 1 judge insight in delicate case like this.Bitcoin legal status should be first established and verified by board of experts. This stupid sentence of biased jury could cause perturbation on a massive scale.Governments Cant Decide on What Bitcoin Is - people pay taxes so you better learn fast!

### Reply 2:
The State of Florida fears this decision because it could be used as a reference by defense lawyers to make an argument for judges to junk cases that involve BTC and money laundering. Those prosecutors will fight tooth and nail to get Espinoza behind bars and make a sample of him.

Great plan but do we really need another platform intended for this? we already have bitcointalk where anyone can share their own sentiments. discuss anything related to bitcoin and as well anyone can hire here any skilled person what you have mentioned. But eventhough we already have strong community here still proceed on your plan since if many can see that your platform created is good place to stay then maybe many will use it and do their activities just like what they did here in bitcointalk.

Topic: Bitcoin's market position inflation corrected
### Original post:
On February 9th, 2011 Bitcoin had a market position (price) of 1 USD.Now, on June, 11th, 2023, the market position of Bitcoin is ~25,000 USD. But is this right? A lot of ""money people"" or ""Bitcoin maximalists"" are telling this story. But this is not true at all. Inflation corrected is around 30 to 40 percent of the ~25.000 USD. So it is basically a market position (in relation of the value of 2011) of ~12,000 USD.This is also really good,but it shows two things:1. Bitcoin is FIAT-bounded, and through exchange rates, has a worse inflation rate as FIAT.2. Nearly every aggregator and exchange which is showing Bitcoin rates not indlation corrected is scamming! (To pump FIAT in the market.)Prove me wrong, I would love to be wrong! But I am not.Edit:And this is just the inflation related to Bitcoin-Fiat/good. What is about the ""chain-inflation""? First Bitcoin has 21 million, first fork has 21 million, and so on - and all this Bitcoin eating from the same bowl...

### Reply 1:
I fail to understand your logic behind this calculation or I am too stupid to understand it. I would like you to explain me this like I am a five.Why are we even comparing 11th June, 2023 Bitcoin price with 2011 price? What Inflation corrected in market for Bitcoin? I am not even drunk mate.Still your thread is way above my level of understanding.

### Reply 2:
You get it right, it's the other way round. Actually, what he says is not wrong, but it is partly true and partly not.Cumulative inflation, as calculated by him.Yes, but what he says is not wrong. It's like me telling you that I bought a house for $500,000 and sold it after 10 years for $550,000. On the face of it I have made a profit but if cumulative inflation over that period is 30% I have lost money in real terms, not to mention that I have to pay capital gains tax on a profit that if we discount inflation I have not made. What the OP is doing is deflating, I think it is called, the price of bitcoin measured in fiat, which is not bad but he is wrong when he says that bitcoin is inflationary, as the accumulated profitability beats inflation by far.

I believe those early OG bitcoiners are true heroes - the ones like Laszlo Hanyecz and others who remain anonymous. They distributed or sold for peanuts tens of thousands of their bitcoin to ensure that Bitcoin did not become centralised.Not all heroes wear capes

### Reply 2:
Thinking of it, I do not follow notable names in the Bitcoin world, a few names pop up like Hal Finney, but overall I do not really look up to anyone in the Bitcoin community. Don't get me wrong, there are lots of notable members who have cobtributed immensely to the growth of Bitcoin many of which would not be k own publicly.This forum and all the members who keep it going as the most reliable resource for Bitcoin discussions after quite a number of years would pass as my Bitcoin heros and heroines.

Topic: How not having money helped my Bitcoin journey
### Original post:
I see how some newbies are complaining about not having enough money to invest in Bitcoin, some times not having money is a blessing in the crypto space, if I had money years ago when I knew about crypto I would have made all the possible mistakes in the book, and that would have cost me a lot.I had no access to money when I knew about Bitcoin, I had the desire to acquire many Bitcoin but I have no way, instead of moving on with my life I kept myself busy, reading and reading about Bitcoin, installed my first Bitcoin wallet on a Pentium 4 PC, I knew about Proof of work, I tried mining for the first time using a dual-core PC ( second PC ), if I have enough money to invest I wouldn't have had time for all this learning. I got so calm, because what is there to rush about? I have no money anyways, since that time learning became my first priority. If you don't have the money yet, maybe because you are jobless or still in school, do not let that be the reason to be out of Bitcoin, there is more you can learn that will help you in your crypto journey. Money is coming, but be prepared by learning about Bitcoin, you will be in safer hands with the knowledge you would have acquired.

### Reply 1:
If you don't have money to invest, there are many ways to get yourself aided in this, one of which is to engage in doing menial jobs that can help you have some savings, provide services for people or organizations that will pay you in bitcoin, take you time to invest in learning about bitcoin even before investing, don't also make the mistake to borrow money from any source no matter how the amount is.

### Reply 2:
This is true. The desire of someone to learn how to earn is much stronger if you need something badly rather than when you already the thing you are looking for which is money.Still, Its a case to case basis because you can do better when you have money during the early stage of Bitcoin for a better investment. The best example here is the winkleboss twin who invested there money that get from Facebook lawsuit to Bitcoin that result for a greater fortune to them. This will not gonna happened if you will start from nothing because Bitcoin price keeps growing in fast phase.

I came across a post made on this forum by someone that says he has $20k for investment as such he was looking for people to advice him on how to go about it, for me it was actually a bad idea consorting everyone for investment advice because you could be lured by scammers to invest on a shitcoin as such loosing all your money because of lack of knowledge about Bitcoin or any investment in general, as someone that has no idea on investment I think the first thing was research google to learn more and also the risk involves. so I was thrilled to create this topic, so everyone could help by sharing there own knowledge on what someone that has no knowledge about investment should no before venturing into. I may not be the right person for investment advice that's why I'm asking everyone to share their advice, views and knowledge incase something like this should come up, so people could learn and no what must be done before going into investment.

investment advice is given based on self interest. it is as simple as that..if one has invested in gold, they would tell others that gold is a solid investment.why? because if demand for gold increases so will the price and their investment makes profit.therefore, if someone is telling u to buy something, if is because it is in their interest.who ever is looking to invest should do their own research.in the end it all comes down to demand and supply no matter what it is.so, basically one should try to invest in something which has shorter supply and greater demand.

He can be a very stupid investor or he is a scammer.He can pretend to be lazy and stupid and attract some people who want to be advisors. If he is a scammer and plan to scam you, he will send you phishing links or malicious documents, files to install threats on your devices.If he is stupid, actually stupid and very lazy, I have no words to comment about him.I am keen on a possibility that such newbie user is more like a scammer pretends to be newbie.

Topic: NIGERIA TO ESTABLISH SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE FOR BITCOIN & CRYPTO
### Original post:
On the 5th of February 2021, CBN (Central Bank of Nigeria) puts a ban on banks and regulated institutions from dealing with bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. With respect to the ban, there was a rise of UpTo 27% in the use of p2p bitcoin and crypto transactions across Nigeria.Nigerian naira was traded at #380 naira against US dollar, some months later the rate increased to #416 and goes above N560 and year later but as of today I sold 142.8 USD at the rate of 1USD to #707 (Naira) which gave me a total of #101,111 (one houndred & one thousand, houndred & eleven Naira). Last year, Africa is sited as the largest country in P2P transactions in the world by volume. According to the report of Chainalysis which shows Nigeria is the top 10 countries worldwide in the adoption of bitcoin.Currently, the Nigeria Export Processing Zones Authority (NEPZA) is in discussions with one of the leading crypto exchange Binance, and some Talent City that specialize in building a special economic zone. the reason is to establish a special economic zone for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in West Africa. NEPZA whishes to establish a partnership binance and talent cities. This economic zone will report<rest of post truncated>

I dislike when people point out mistakes but fail to correct them. I expected you to have shared the link to the alternate thread which you claim has been posted before but you never did. So however, here is the link..Nigeria FG to partner BinanceThou, I do not encourage duplicate thread posting on the forum, but I think if you should, try writing your thread from a different point of view that makes people understand a particular concept from a different angle just like bloggers do when writing a blog post. Just like the O.P did, emphasizing on the crypto restrictions leading to the fail in the value of dollar to Naira rate, of which currently traded at #707 per 1USD,

### Reply 2:
I love this partnership with Binance and I am hoping that nothing will be able to block this vision into the future and things or plans can be big realities at the appropriate time. I am seeing that Nigeria is getting to be the hub of cryptocurrency in Africa and their government should learn to recognize and capitalize on this. There are so many ways one can de dealing with cryptocurrency and yet at the same time having the right control over things.

Topic: What If Bitcoin Fall??
### Original post:
I would like to let you to share your ideas about what if bitcoin falls?? Let others to know about badconsequence people have to face if bitcoin falls. Thank you Guyz.attention - i am not talking about bitcoin's current price action . i know these are buying opportunities for investors . I dont mean about bitcoin's price falling . i mean what if bitcoin isn't exist , what if bitcoin wasn't created.

### Reply 1:
Think of the Ath value of bitcoin. The price is close to $70k and what is today's price? $20k, What a difference between the ath and the present value of bitcoin. So, the price have fallen to reach the current price. During this time period what happened in the market. There is nothing big happened in the market. Everything is on a cyclic process as a result we're experiencing decline and can experience bounce back soon.

### Reply 2:
Why bother asking questions that actually have no use for discussion. For example, Bitcoin doesn't exist? the answer is that you will not know anything about Bitcoin, nor will altcoins and shitcoins be born, you will not make money in crypto, and maybe you will be a fiat slave forever. That's a typical answer, so what kind of answer do you expect?

I'm already tired to see this kind topic to be honest, it's not wrong to recommend anyone to invest Bitcoin, but it's already too much and doesn't talk about anything that important.Just look about the other thread that you've created before:1. No Alternative to Bitcoin, Your Alternative is Bitcoin. 2. Why Bitcoin is the most Preferred ChoiceEveryone in this forum already know Bitcoin is really the best crypto to invest especially this forum is full of Bitcoin enthusiast, but it's really important to repeat over and over? You can't force anyone decision to invest what coin or asset they want to invest.

### Reply 2:
Well, simply because there's multiple factors in play. This could be the best time to invest in Bitcoin in terms of future profitability, but people simply don't have the money, and the risk of it is magnified because of the recession that we're currently sliding into. This will probably be the biggest recession that a lot of people have seen in their lifetime, and that's going to play a major role in the price of Bitcoin, simply because buying power is down, and generally people's faith is lowered since they have less money. Of course, Bitcoin has a proven track record of recovering from dips, but you can't compare the previous dips to this one, because all the dips before it never had a compounding effect or long term issues like a massive recession. It probably will recover, and a lot of us are probably confident in that, but when is the question. This recession could last years, and while Bitcoin was created on the back of a recession, during a recession it'll probably perform like any other investment, poorly due to the buying power being reduced. So, if the war continues for a couple of years in Ukraine, and the recession from that, and the pandemic lasts a couple of years, w<rest of post truncated>

Topic: 1 fixed unchangeable bitcoin address per username on a site?
### Original post:
Hey,If on a site you enforce that each user is only allowed one bitcoin address that isn't publicly visible, could there be any unforeseen issues? AFAIK it should be OK- if someone discovers their bitcoin address then they just make a new one and get a new username. And if someone DID get their bitcoin address, all they could do is view their transactions using that address.Am I correct?Thanks

### Reply 1:
Why limit it. There are plenty for everyone. Its not like you'll run out.Ya the main effect is they lose what privacy they could have with multiple addresses. It's not a matter of someone accidently discovering the address. It's that anyone they want payment from will need to have it and thus will have access to the full list of transactions on that address.

Topic: Bitcoin transaction fees are too high, obstacle for adoption and in general
### Original post:
Hi,I just wanted to share my thoughts about the high Bitcoin transaction fees. I see people paying USD 10 for an item, and then paying USD 30 in fee for the BTC transaction, and I realize that this is not sustainable. And its impossible for BTC to become a mainstream payment method if the price is increased with x3 when you buy something.I understand that the ""network is congested"" and im sure people are working on it. But in my opinion this should be top priority no 1! It is hard to explain to people all the time that they should use LTC or ETH or something else when we just started to get people to trust Bitcoin. What is my suggested solution? That the people that can actually do something about this, the people involved in the development, start to act like grownups and sort this issue once and for all!Im not going to solve it, not with this article and not by complaining. But others can and they should!This is not sustainable over a longer time. Bitcoin popularity might be increasing but with fees like now it will never really work.Please some intelligent involved developer read this and get motivated! <3

### Reply 1:
Well, you will have to get used to it. This is what is will be like in the future. Bitcoin's success means higher fees.

### Reply 2:
Bitcoin isn't perfect but people can make their transaction with lower transaction fee and still be able to buy wanted items. Like you want to save your money, prepare money for Black Friday with massive discounts on many things.With Bitcoin, you can choose times to make transactions with cheaper fee, like weekends and when mempools are not too congested. If you can prepare more like consolidate your inputs when fee is cheap, you are good when fee is higher or expensive. Use Segwit address bech32 bc1q for your transactions. By doing this, you self help yourself and minimize cost for your transactions.People can choose altcoin networks, stable coins for cheaper fees when they don't see fit to use Bitcoin network.

Topic: I have always wanted to ask this about bitcoin
### Original post:
Will people still use or buy bitcoin till today if all it has to offer is the decentralized characteristic only, I am trying to say that if bitcoin is stable in value from day one and has no investment ability will you still buy it? if all it has to offer is moving money around and no volatility, will Bitcoin be your favorite still? Drop your thoughts and let's see.I am thinking that the Volatile is what makes bitcoin a must have for almost everybody, think I am wrong? And people won't see a reason to buy Bitcoin if there were no Volatility from day one.

### Reply 1:
People want to control their finances independently. The government and the banks really puts a lot of pressure on the people and impose unnecessary taxes in the name of development of the nation. This is the reason for which many people dont want to give away their hard earned money in the form of tax and hence they look for decentralised way of managing their finances. Bitcoins provide this and hence many people use the coin. Bitcoins price cannot be fixed, if it is no more decentralised. To make the price stable, some governing body needs to manage it, and here it cannot be possible.

### Reply 2:
Although it's clearly impossible to control Bitcoin price is stable to $1, I will answer I will still buy Bitcoin because I need the privacy and security of Bitcoin. I don't want to let anyone know how much wealth I have and in Bitcoin there's almost no chance your coin will get hacked. Bitcoin could be more stable, but not 100% stable in the future. When the price become really expensive and no country restricts their citizens to buy Bitcoin. it's the time where most people will adopt Bitcoin.

Topic: How are you storing your Brc-20s?
### Original post:
Is the Bitcoin discussion thread the right place to talk about Ordinals? Sorry if not and maybe someone should tell me where this fits best on the forum and I will move it in no time, I want to get few numbers of Ordi and I found out that it's not going to be that easy. I am looking into wallets that support BRC-20, do you know of any that's open source? The few wallets I came across are all web wallets.Is there anyway to add BRC-20 in popular Bitcoin wallets like Electrum or Trust Wallet?

### Reply 1:
You can get a Ledger or Trezor wallet or any other reliable hardware wallets, these help keep your tokens safely reducing the risk of them being compromised by hackers. Hardware wallets typically require authentication codes or passphrase to access your tokens and provide an extra layer of security. You can use software wallets that are specifically designed for BRC-20 tokens. Examples of popular BSC-compatible wallets include MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Binance Chain Wallet. These wallets allow you to securely store and control your BRC-20 tokens on your device It is worthy of note that you shouldn't keep large amounts of cryptocurrency on exchanges or platforms unless you intend to actively trade with them. Exchanges are vulnerable to hacks, and in the event of a security breach, your funds could be at risk.You can actually learn more about BRC-20 tokens and related topics by visiting the official Binance website at <link> And others at...<link> the above sites for more about BRC-20

### Reply 2:
No and No!Bitcoin discussion should be exclusive for bitcoin and not some tokens that have been introduced to scam newbies. Please move the thread to altcoin discussion or service discussion (altcoins)

I won't believe anyone claiming to be Satoshi UNLESS he/she/they can move the coins in the wallet that received the Block 1000 reward.<link> even god or the devil can move these coins. Only the real Satoshi Nakamoto can. Let's call this the Block 1000 challenge

### Reply 2:
Well, if it is true that it is a criminal offense to make false claims, then we will see Craig Wright going to jail soon. ...Nooot! Craig Wright will have to go to court and prove that he is Satoshi Nakamoto and that is a very difficult task if you have no private keys for the Bitcoin addresses that were used by Satoshi Nakamoto when he still mined coins. Will the courts and lawyers know how signed messages work in Bitcoin? Will they get Bitcoin experts to dispute his claims in court? Time will tell...

Topic: Police reportedly seize South Korea's largest crypto exchange Bithumb
### Original post:
The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency has reportedly seized South Korea's largest crypto exchange Bithumb for alleged fraud.South Korea's oldest newspaper, the Seoul Shinmun, reported the news on Wednesday, saying that Bithumb's offices have been raided. The exchange is reportedly accused of pre-selling native BXA tokens worth about 30 billion won (~$25 million) to investors and then not listing the token, which has allegedly led to losses to investors.Bithumb is said to have issued BXA tokens in 2018 concerning its acquisition by Singapore-based BK Group. But that deal reportedly didn't materialize. Bithumb chairman Lee Jung Hoon is also said to be under investigation by police on charges of escaping property.The Block has reached out to Bithumb for comments and will update this story should we hear back.<link>

### Reply 1:
Well, there you have it, the reason why the market went down today:<link> least this whole thing has nothing to do with major cryptos like BTC or ETH but rather a sketchy token. The drop in the btc price was probably caused by korean panic sellers shitting bricks after reading the headlines cheap coins before we test 12k again? decent short-term profits =P

### Reply 2:
This is a major blow to cryptocurrency trading in South Korea. Bithumb is the country's largest crypto exchange and even making it to the top ten cryptocurrency exchange in the world in terms of 24-hour trading volume. While the case is still under investigation, the initial information available right now seems to suggest that the exchange really has a responsibility over the BXA mess which caused a significant monetary damage to the investors. For me, this is good news, although it is also sad news at the same time. This is a statement that crypto companies have to shape up.

Topic: Is there any good explanation to this dip
### Original post:
It's not a thing of surprise anymore to see bitcoin dip about 10 to 20% from its previous price of $48k on it's price within the late December to earlier January after hitting a good price, after which price started declining without control to the level of $38k as current price. Who knows what could be the next dip and this may lead to 35k to 30k causing serious panic to the market and holders, please any thing the cause of the dip as we know it's based on news.

### Reply 1:
Stuff like this sorts the men from the boys.Expectation was built up in regards to this ETF decision and the price went up.The decision was positive, so time for the men to take profits as all looks good.Now just wait until all the boys panic and sell and then see where it bottoms out.Then the men start buying again.....

### Reply 2:
People were hyping the ETF approval, and many were saying that Bitcoin price would increase significantly following the ETF approval. The price pumped a few thousand dollars, and then we see a sudden dump because more retail investors joined the party and allowed whales to empty their wallets. In the past 2 weeks, approximately 70k BTC were sold by whales worth around $3 Billion. The market will correct itself for the time being. The chances are that we might see a dip toward or below $35k in the coming weeks.

Topic: Initial Bitcoin client development cost
### Original post:
Hello,Does anyone have a link to any research done on the approximate cost of developing something like the initial Bitcoin client? (Don't remember what the version # is but I'm referring to one Satoshi initially made available after the first public posting about the technology.)I'm thinking not only about the cost of developing the idea and writing the initial code but also Dan Kaminsky's statement that there are entire classes of bugs missing from it.Thanks

### Reply 1:
The latter.

### Reply 2:
Estimates don't make any sense for this kind of software, since it had something really distruptive & innovative inside it.However now everyone could make their own bitcoin fork easily, since the algorithms and the idea is now public knowledge. So you could have bitcoin fork really cheaply, since it is open source.

Topic: If Satoshi reveals himself, what would be of Bitcoin?
### Original post:
What do you think that will happen once the real Satoshi reveals himself (and proves that he created Bitcoin)? Will Bitcoin ever be the same? Will governments try to pursue Satoshi and put him in jail?This will be something interesting to know, once it happens (if it ever does) sometime in the future. Please feel free to share your thoughts here.

### Reply 1:
If Satoshi comes out in the open, no one can predict whether it will be beneficial or detrimental for Bitcoin. For example, if he is someone with a past criminal activity, then it can affect the reputation of Bitcoin. Also, it will be interesting to see how the authorities react. In all probability, they will try to jail him for challenging the fiat money system.

### Reply 2:
Likely nothing would change, chances are he would be viewed as a target for a lot of countries and they would likely want to get their hands on him (or them) and gain access to the base technology behind Bitcoin.Now of course that is assuming there is enough information to prove that he's the real satoshi, and until that information is made available I don't think he would rustle anyone's jimmies.

Topic: The origin of bitcoin
### Original post:
It has been suggested that Cicada 3301 might have something to do with the most talked-about topic in the world of cryptanalysis: Bitcoin. Bitcoin is money generated by software that can only be obtained by cracking various digital codes. Finding Bitcoin is much like deciphering a Cicada 3301 clue, just using computer power and not occult poetry. This online currency, which was once only whispered about in the dark corners of the Internet, has become a talking point in mainstream financial media, launching hundreds of other cryptocurrency competitors and plans for the very first Bitcoin ATM in Zurich.Satoshi Nakamoto is the creator of Bitcoin,responsible for releasing 21 million units of thecurrency into the digital wild in 2009. Since then, a little over 12 million of them have been found, and their value has sky rocketed; at time of publishing, one Bitcoin will value $708 in Us dollars, although this price is unstable. This means that those who bought some ofthe currency early because of its novelty havebecome rich overnight without doing any real work. It also means that Satoshi Nakamoto, who is said to have put aside one million Bitcoin for himself, is a very rich man. Or woman<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
We are all Satoshi Nakamoto and the creator is of no significance for the majority of us. We see the potential of the technology and look past the creator. So, he comes back and sell his/her coins and the price drops to $200 or $20 ..... Loads of people start buying again and the cycle continue. The technology is more important than the person that created it.

### Reply 2:
It could very well be the case. Satoshi Nakamoto has always been to me a team of people, never a single individual. How could a single man start all of this thing by himself? There's also said that the code is too perfect to be the work a single man. No matter how good you are at coding, you always make mistakes, it's only once other people look at it when you find those mistakes.Or maybe he was just a single guy tho.. who knows.

Hello all,Thankfully, Twitter has re-activated our FeedZeBirds application (they had disabled it a couple weeks ago and we had to take FZB offline since then). The site is now back up, and stronger than ever. Having now been vetted by Twitter, we are clearly in compliance with their terms and they're happy with our system.We've used the downtime to add a couple features:- Instant payment confirmation (your campaigns will activate immediately upon payment receipt - no need to wait for 6 confirmations now)- Stronger anti-spam measures (a backend system was built which vets many accounts automatically, and ""greylist"" accounts are manually vetted by us)- Boilerplate has been reworked and is shorter, now says: ""#Retweet4Bitcoin #spon <truncated> (this means campaigns can now be 86 chars instead of 77)Please note that due to the issues with BTCinch dissolving, prior campaigns can no longer be funded with their prior payment addresses. Those campaigns will now simply run down until they're empty (they still show on the site). Promoters will need to create new campaigns, and will get new payment addresses for them. Our apologies for this inconvenience but it will be smooth sailing from her<rest of post truncated>

Hi Abaaj,Yes of course you can use your 50k account. However if we see the followers are all fake or bots, etc. then we'll ban you for all eternity =)The payments haven't changed - they're always based on the CPM bid of the person who creates the campaign. If you think there's an actual math problem occuring, please send me a PM and we'll get it resolved.

Topic: Fair Value of Bitcoin
### Original post:
Hey folks,I've recently resurrected ALFAquotes website with the new name: bitcoinfair.org which was calculating Bitcoin's Fair Value (Price) and was mentioned in CoinDesk: <link> <link> formula may be interesting for long-term investors and correlation is pretty interesting. Inspiration to create such formula and calculate for the whole period of Bitcoin's existence came after getting familiar with Ben Graham's works.Fair Value is fully based only on mining costs, price has no influence on it, but correlation between two is pretty interesting.

### Reply 1:
Why is the mining cost the ""fair"" value? Also, I have some bitcoins from when it cost $5 to mine a bitcoin. Does that mean that those bitcoins are worth $5?BTW, the cost of mining and the price are correlated because the price acts as a ceiling on the cost of mining. In general, miners will not mine when the cost of mining exceeds the cost of buying.

### Reply 2:
What makes it ""true""? Perhaps you could explain what you mean by ""fair"" and ""true"", and how they relate to mining cost.I'm still curious about my bitcoin. If it was mined for $5 in 2012 and I sell it today for $25000, is the buyer getting a fair price? Am I?

Your title is misleading, you're actually asking how to make money with Bitcoin.To answer that, there's a lot of topics on this forum and articles on the Internet about this subject. But from my experience, the opportunities are very scarce, and generally it's better to earn fiat currency and buy Bitcoin with it, rather than trying to earn Bitcoin directly.

Topic: Bitcoin devs can undo 21M supply cap but cant force changes
### Original post:
<link> developers can theoretically remove the 21-million-Bitcoin supply limit from the source code, but miners are unlikely to accept such a change, according to one analyst.I'm sure this comes as a huge relief for all of you guys. Then they go on to say this:Like most other codes, Bitcoins source code can be modified, meaning the 21-million limit is theoretically changeable. However, such a change will have to be accepted by miners to be effective, according to Josef Ttek, a Bitcoin analyst at the hardware wallet firm Trezor.The more people write about how the 21 million limit can be changed, the more its going to get into peoples' heads that maybe it should be changed. That way they could own more bitcoin and get richer. That's how they would think about it.

### Reply 1:
That is wrong. The value of Bitcoin doesn't come from miners, but it comes from the community and the users actively transacting with it. Even if the miners were to adopt it, if the community doesn't support it or people don't use it, then Bitcoin becomes useless. It is to their best interests to support the sentiments of the majority given their billions of dollars in investment. Most people understand basic economics regardless, so the supply cap probably won't gain any traction.

### Reply 2:
Actually I see no point in fiddling with the supply cap;1) If you have no cap at all, then that means kind of unlimited supply and the value will go down the drain....2) another higher cap lets say 100 millions, just the same as now just pushed back a couple of years....3) 2 versions of bitcoins, one with a cap and the other without a cap -sounds not really promisingSo I think this topic can be ignored for a long time

What do you obesrve in the world today? What is the advantage of the world today from the world yesterday?Inovation is good but sometimes there is a disadvantage.Do we have world peace? When bitcoin is invented what is the help of bitcoin in the world? I made this thread for the members to comeup with something that can help the world or the communities as a whole. Not for their own interest only. What do you guys think about bitcoin and the environment can we help the environment with bitcoin? Can we help poor people using bitcoin? Can we help poor communities using bitcoin.? I'm searching for much higher cause of cryptocurrency than just medium of trade or source of income. Maybe it can be bigger and greater. Maybe bitcointalk community can help.

### Reply 1:
Well, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, in general, are already being used in regions that have inflation problems. They cannot be censored, and you can't have your account frozen. I'd say that is helping out quite a bit. There are also many charities that accept crypto, and they often go for several top coins, not just Bitcoin. This helps by letting you know where your money is going, and what they use it for, so you know that you are actually helping, instead of just filling some rich guy's pockets. These may seem like small steps, but it is important to remember that BTC is still pretty new, and that it is only money. It may be an advanced version of money, one that doesn't suffer from some fiat money issues, but it is still only money, not a magic solution to the world's problems. That is something that we can only change by changing our views on the world and the way we think.

### Reply 2:
Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general could be used as a medium of donations to non-government organizations with visions to help the people or the environment. Since cryptocurrencies does not require too much fees, and transactions are almost limitless, acquiring help for those in need is easier than with central banks. It also helps the community send money without the need of intermediaries such as local money remittances, you can directly send funds to anyone you'd like as long as you know their public address.

If Satoshi was worth $36b in 2022, Bitcoin would have a market capitalisation of $600b. Bitcoin would be causing waves, and each Bitcoin would be valued at $30k each. Some speculate Satoshi is not an individual, but rather a group. Perhaps this group has good intentions and want to make the world a better place. Curiously, Larry's personal fortune is on par with the endowment of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Perhaps ""Satoshi"" might start offering BTC bounties to make the world a better place. Think X PRIZE? A cure for Malaria?

It was self-important enough to create an untraceable identity. I am sure it assigned the same importance to its Bitcoins as well.

The code has been found to be meticulous. I think we are dealing with some high-level shit here. As for who and what, it's unknowable. Just buy some coins and enjoy the ride. I, for one, thank our influential benefactors.

Topic: Early Birds are always on time - Bitcoin, king In the crypto space.
### Original post:
I have heard several people saying ""it's not too late to invest now in Bitcoin"". Erik Fineman in 2011 invested $1000 in Bitcoin for $12 each Bitcoin, later in 2013 Bitcoin was trading above $1k+ he made a fortune ( Reference link ) Bitcoin in 2010 $0.09, in 2013 it spiked to $1200, may 2017 it moved past $2k, June 2020 was $9k+ and November 2021 it spiked above $60k. It's still possible to archive more hight in future and early investors will earn a fortune too. There are some factors that affect BTC price (Like whales) but I know that any time BTC price dumps so hard, is a sign ""we can buy more"". A friend of mine had 5 Bitcoin back then in 2013 and he told me he was going to sell it any year Bitcoin could hit his target which was $25k, in 2014 I lost contact of him, January 2021 when Bitcoin moved pass $25k he was the first person I thought of but there was no means to hear from him. Most persons are still speculative about the right time to invest in Bitcoin, some invest in scam Altcoin, shit coins and meme coins with the believe that it's easy to make huge profit from tokens whose price are yet not below $1. Some new project can promise huge staking reward, auto compounding inte<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Yes we can say that early birds have made profits but can't say surely about them also as many who invested at say $1 also sold it for normal return while others who have hold it for some time has managed to gain profits.We can say that if you invest now also and hold it for say 5-6 years then definitely you would also make a fortune out of it depending on how much you have in your wallets safely.People are always busy in saying they miss the opportunity or it's gonna be dead so we need to ignore them as much possible and focus on our own investment strategies and invest in btc.But most of the time whales are taking advantage of this situation because they can manipulate the altcoins pump dump through their investments and when they gain profits out of it they dump these tokens and people who have invested in it are left with pennies in their wallet.So even if you get small profits out of them cash out it immediately because they can dump anytime.

### Reply 2:
if you invested $1000 in 2010 ($0.32) and sold in 2011 hype ($32.00) 100x = $100k ($99k profit)if you bought $1000 in 2012 ($12)and sold in 2013 hype ($1200) 100x = $100k ($99k profit)if you bought $1000 in 2014 ($200)and sold in 2017 hype ($20,000) 100x = $100k ($99k profit)if you bought $1000 in 2015 ($600)and sold in 2018 ($6,000) 10x = $10k ($9k profit)if you bought $1000 in 2016 ($700)and sold in 2019 ($7,000) 10x = $10k ($9k profit)if you bought $1000 in 2018 ($6,000)and sold in 2021 hype ($60,000) 10x = $10k ($9k profit)if you bought $1000 in 2019 ($7,000)and sold in 2021 ($70,000) 10x = $10k ($9k profit)..if you bought $1000 in 2020 ($9,000)and sold..in.. well im gonna guess 2022 ($90,000)..as for 2021 low of $17kthere is no chance of a $170k price in 2021*. so you might have to wait a couple years but a $90k *window(based on the mining window of fundemental low hihg costs possibility of an economic window price sits withn) there is a chance of a $90k in the next year)so those buying at the lows of 2020 may get returns next year. ..yes early adopters got 100x within a year. where things are more like 10x in 2-4 years.which in a decade may become more lower/stable increments

Topic: Will Bitcoin developers jump ship with the sudden high demand for Blockchain dev
### Original post:
Blockchain based technologies are suddenly a trend and every Tom, Dick and Harry wants it's company to develop their own Blockchain based technology. We also saw huge corporations like Facebook getting in on the action with Libra and this will spark copy cats from trying the same. The question is, will our skilled Bitcoin developers abandon Bitcoin when these large companies approach them to work on their projects or would they stand firm against these money bags? What will Bitcoin be without these people working hard behind the scenes to constantly improve and secure the technology for us all?

### Reply 1:
Yes it is Opensource, but you get very talented developers and then you get crappy developers and the people participating now are excellent. A lot of these people are doing this for the bigger cause and not the money, but we saw people like Mike Hearn leaving for the money and this can happen to the people we have now, if the offer is high enough. <Well, Mike Hearn might be a bad example, because he tried to sabotage Bitcoin and he rage quit when he did not succeed.> We need people who are passionate about the cause and not people who would sabotage the project.

### Reply 2:
""Bitcoin developers"" is in fact a blanket term, Bitcoin is an open source project with hundreds of contributors. It's very possible that many of those contributors can be working or will work in the future in some blockchain-related projects. Blockstream is the biggest example that comes to mind. There's nothing wrong with that, people can still do both easily. If you mean that the most active developers will abandon Bitcoin for a blockchain job, I don't think it's likely to happen now, they seem to be very passionate about Bitcoin.

### Original post:
What is BTC Seer? is this a bitcoin option product from bitoffer exchange?Recently, I heard about BTC Seer from many forums and telegram groups. I think this is a bitcoin option derivative product, but I don't know how it exactly work and how can this product stand out from numerous bitcoin options product on the market.Do you guys know about this bitcoin option product called ""BTC Seer""?

### Reply 1:
BTC Option? like the mode in IQ Option?

### Reply 2:
BTC seer is a new innovative product that will be offered by bitoffer exchange. As I can remember my friends on facebook and twitter have posted several ads about btc seer since they are giving away 10$ to users who register and comply with the KYC. In my opinion the new thing is this btc seer is the option, I guess if it has an option then it will look like olymptrade, IQ options, Etoro and other brokers. Well one thing to find out is to register and discover how it really works.

Topic: Faruk Ozer, turkey crypto whizz sentenced to 11,196 years in jail? Wow!
### Original post:
I personally felt slapped and amazed in a mixed feeling to hear that a young man who claims to be a cryptocurrency whizz could be sent to over 11 thousand years behind bars? Like seriously? We aren't even talking days, hours or even minutes here. I personally felt embarrassed as a crypto fan to see headlines carrying 'Cryptocurrency boss' in such scandalous case reported by the news.This, I feel, is tarnishing the image of the cryptocurrencies to have defrauded businesses and move it through his company, Thodex. Thodex was founded in 2017 and became on of Turkey's largest exchange for digital currencies.I brought this topic here, firstly, because of the amazement, secondly to know if there are possibilities of stopping this from happening again tomorrow, even though, cryptocurrencies are decentralized and have little regulations. I felt numb to see such an 'acclaimed' crypto big whiz involved in scamming over 2,027 victims. I mean anyone from this forum could fall a victim.News sources: <link> question is, how do we identify and overcome such fraudsters in the system, now and in future?

### Reply 1:
The only way that the problem you're talking about can be overcome is if each individual are thinking or asking the right questions (if they know the right questions to ask) to someone who proposes them with something, so there's less likely people to fall prey to scams. But in truth though, I think it's difficult to get rid of fraudsters in the system, some appear legitimate at first and then when the right time happens that's when they show what they really are an defraud people. Two good examples of this is @Yogg and Bernie Madoff, they both came off as someone that was trustworthy but lo and behold, they decided to still scam people.

### Reply 2:
Such weird prison sentences are common in Turkey, for example in 2021 they put 1239 people (including 305 children between the ages of 12 to 17) in prison for ""insulting the president""!It is tough in most cases to detect this type of scams, we already have a history filled with big and small versions of them specially among the centralized exchanges that keep running away. The difficult part is of course because they don't look like scams since they are working fine until they run away!

Paper currency is mostly used to score drugs and other illegal activities, no one will go to a drug peddler and open his bitcoin wallet to score these drugs , after all you need the paper currency to snort these after scoring these and you cannot digitally snort these up with bitcoin . These people forget that fiat currency valuation comes from thin air. If a government is giving a promise that a paper currency has valuation you cannot trust those empty promise as they can very well withdraw those promises any time and you see the exact situation in India when the government declared that the currency is invalid.

I wish you much success!And for payments via bitcoin, provide some kind of incentive, give discounts or whatever, be a real encourager for people to use bitcoin. We need this a lot these daysAnother thing, adjust the size of the images to make them more suitable for the forum.

Nice to hear that your father used the public funds meant for the development of the citizens to open a bar for you to increase the drunken in the society. Bar is always to attract more drinkers. Well it is a good thing that you open your own bar but as a daughter of a politician, a bar work is not good for you. And I will advise you not to take Bitcoin as your payment option for now because of the tx fee. And why did you use the money to invest in Bitcoin and just relax and Monitor the market because that bar business will stress you. You have to buy fuel and pay workers but in investment you would not do all this.

Topic: According to McAfee main trigger 4 Bitcoins surging price will be its scarcity
### Original post:
Is that a reason to own it though? Speculation will only cause an equally dramatic fall. Something that volatile can never be a store of value. People who own bags of it will keep on hyping until its time to sell. Its about the transfer of wealth, the storing of it.

### Reply 1:
Hahahahahahaha.... This is an epic savage. Who in this crypto ecosystem does not know that scarcity will cause the surge of Bitcoin's market value? This is really not anything new for people to stress themselves thinking about what McAfee said about scarcity triggering the increase in the market value of Bitcoin. In a demand and supply ecosystem, scarcity automatically cause an increase in the value of that commodity which is scarce in the market.

Topic: Bitcoin Holders Protection
### Original post:
In the US some non-banks are getting into savings account game. Robin Hood, a mobile app for stock trading, created buzz about a project offering 3% interest. It offered no FDIC protection however and has yet fully launch. Wealthfront and Betterment have been offering ~2% interest rate as leading 'high yield"" savings accounts. Credit Karma announced this week that they will be joining the fray offering a ~2% interest savings account with industry-leading $5M in FDIC protection.These are not banks. Technology is already eating up banks and governments around the world are clearly conscious of the fact they won't be able to maintain faith in their national currencies while increasing money supply to bail out failed banks time and time again. We are now seeing the FDIC extend coverage to non-banks that do not have the intention to ever become a bank. What cannot go on forever won't.My hypothesis is that a primary hurdle that keeps people from seeing bitcoin as an option for their savings strategy is the learning curve with safe storage combined with a lack of consumer protection offerings for those that are willing to sacrifice their financial liberties for custodial security.

### Reply 1:
It is the same story. These non-banks that are playing banks and are accepting deposit, they are called bank-like organizations they exist in cooperatives in remittance centers and others financial management businesses. But even though people are getting into non-banks , these entities or non-banks are still depositing their collected money on the banks. This means that it is an old story with only new characters. In terms of Bitcoin, those entities have no effect at all to the cryptocurrency market nor they are related.

### Reply 2:
Bitcoin is a digital money that many people get some income and also a profit that we can use to answer our daily finance. To make secured in your bitcoin because there are to many scammer that wants to get your money.The another way to keep your money is banking system. We also need the old transaction and banking system.

Topic: What features should I add to the Strongcoin e-wallet ?
### Original post:
I've got a bit of free time coming up and I'd like to spend some of that on StrongCoin. Here's a few features I'm considering.1. Email a PDF of your encrypted private keys to you once a month.2. Add the ability to send Bitcoins by email. i.e. You could send a non bitcoin users 0.05 BTC and they would register with StrongCoin to claim the coins.3. Make the site usable on iphone and android. e.g. add a pin so you can quickly send/receive coinds without typing in your full password.Do these sound useful ?Does anyone have an idea that would fix a pain they are having at the moment ?Thanks.

### Reply 1:
Lower fees. I don't really see Strongcoin as competitive with Blockchain.info wallet right now, which is more actively developed and much cheaper to use. Strongcoin hasn't really reacted to the competition out there which is the main issue in my opinion.

### Reply 2:
A ""merchant mode"" so that it is functional as the only tool a merchant needs to accept bitcoins.e.g., Receive BitcoinsEnter amount in USDs and the Receive displays a QR code with the receiving bitcoin address and BTC <truncated> for receipt of coins to each address generated (and alert on on 0/unconfirmed). Notification to an email address that may not necessarily be tied to the same e-mail account used for sign-in. Bonus if another notification is sent if a double-spending attempt is detected (e..g, from a listening network).Ability to create and print a receipt, listing USD amount, BTC amount, date and time and transaction# for payment that was received.Ability to have all incoming payments swept to another address (e.g., at an exchange).

As long as people can speculate and exchangers are unregulated no it won't stabilize soon. Maybe when every coin has been mined and the bulk of coins aren't controlled by the seekrit bitcoin illuminati

Topic: Bitcoin Transaction Accelerator. Does it Work or Just Another Hype?
### Original post:
We know how crazy the last couple of weeks have been with the network congestion and transaction fees. Even some signature campaign managers have had to open it up for the participants to choose whether they want to be paid monthly or biweekly. This was one of the solutions to reduce the time it took for a transaction to confirm and save some costs. For participants of other signature campaigns who didn't have this option, they had to wait two (2) to three (3) days before their payment arrived.While browsing the service board, I came across a user's post advertising a free or paid bitcoin transaction accelerator (please note that the purpose of this topic is not to discuss the user's reputation; I am indifferent to that. However, I noticed that no reputable member has interacted with the thread). In simple terms, a bitcoin transaction accelerator is used to speed up the confirmation rate of transactions.My questions are:First, do bitcoin transaction accelerators actually work as they claim, or is it just hype? Second, aside from bitcoin transaction accelerator services, are there manual ways to speed up transactions? Third, does using a bitcoin transaction accelerator reduce the hi<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
I would say they actually do work but just like the post above only ViaBTC is the most trusted by the forum community, but there is also the BitTools but I am not certain of its transparency. But aside them most of these accelerators just coming out recently seems more like an hype to me or maybe scammers tactics.Aside the method of either RBF or CPFP, the only manual way could be tipping off of a mining pool or a miner offline if youre familiar with one to include your transaction into the block.

### Reply 2:
Yes they do AFAIK. Some in their description tell you that they only rebroadcast your transaction, ViaBTC helps to include transactions into their blocks for mining, for free submissions it has to be below a certain size and the tx fees have to be above a certain sat/vbyteThe only way is to bump the fee paid on the transaction if RBF is enabled. You can take a proactive step to consolidate your inputs when fees are low so the feerate on it is low even when the mempool is full.No, it does not reduce the transaction fees it only helps to accelerate transactions already in the mempool- Jay -

Bitcoin is the pioneer in the crypto market. That's the reason why bitcoin is so popular right now. People have invested millions of dollars into mining bitcoin which keeps the network secured. So it is safe to say that bitcoin is expected to have demands always. But I don't think we should be one sighted at all, especially when it comes to investment. There are many other cryptos in the market which are excellent as well and have different use cases which are practical. We should not overlook them for our own benefit. Bitcoin is good but there are other cryptos which are good too. So bitcoin should not be your only last resort. That's stupidity!

### Reply 2:
How does Bitcoin solve the problem of scammy exchanges? The original exchange exit scam happened with Mt. Gox - a Bitcoin-only exchange. Bitcoin protocol doesn't have in-built fiat trading capability, so there must be exchanges in the ecosystem, and p2p exchanges like real life meetings, direct bank transfers and DEXs can't fill the full demand for exchanging BTC and fiat, because not all people want to trade in such risky way. That's where centralized exchanges come in, but because they are not properly regulated, there's a high chance of them doing shady things that eventually make them collapse.

OP posted the Bitcoin Block #225943 was in year 2013 and I'm thinking that it's fine as the price of Bitcoin before was less than $50 but dothebeats found the most recent block with 1 transaction and I'm getting curious why is this even possible up to this day.

### Reply 2:
Yeah absolutely agree with you.The block is of year 2013 and at that time Bitcoin was not so popular among the common mass. Bitcoin was also less than 100 bucks too at that point of time, so it is normal that the block will be smaller compare to the current bitcoin blocks.By the way nice Findings OP lol

### Original post:
<link> careful out there, scammers is using another strategy, although this is not new, but still it looks like very effective as it was reported that they have stolen more than $2 million already. You just don't know, you might get a phone call one of this days so don't believed in everything you hear and just your common sense.

### Reply 1:
ofc thanks for the warning, it is always good to remember about cybersecurity. But there is a point that thieves are stealing cryptocurrencies not because it is crypto but because it is money. Sounds pretty stupid but people are stealing money from other people for already a big amount of time. And it doesn't mean that if those $2M were stolen in crypto then they couldn't have been stolen in fiat.

### Reply 2:
Why the title of the article seems to be made to make bitcoin looks worst while the thieve is not asking payment via bitcoin only as the thieves also ask payment via wire bank transfer and prepaid gift cards? I think the writer is someone who do not like bitcoin and want to make people stay away from bitcoin by creating the title looks like that the thieves are related to bitcoin.

Topic: Bitcoin Master Thesis
### Original post:
Hello there, didn't know where exactly to post this thread, but since it's Bitcoin related, I thought that this board should do just fine. Correct me if I'm wrong, please.I'm currently in the second semester of the Master's Degree I'm attending, in Management and Digital Transformation. The next and last semester is consisted of a master thesis, however, I'm totally clueless on what subject to choose. Previously, on my Bachelor's Degree, I had done research for Covid-19, which is still an intriguing subject, but I'd prefer to try something different.My idea is to do something Cryptocurrency related, either with Bitcoin or even Decentralized Finance (DeFi), however, I haven't decided yet, any ideas on which subject to cover? I'm hoping that more experienced members here could possibly answer my main concern, which is whether I can find reputable and valid sources for such a subject. For instance, when writing a medical thesis, you can resort to a few well-known websites such as ECDC, WHO or even Medical Publications. What about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, though? Will I have difficulties finding decent sources? Moreover, I'm not really a theoretical type of person, I'm good with f<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Since you do much of data analysis then it will do good if you can get specific data about bitcoin within your country and compare them with other countries or have a comparison from the data collected to that of the reputable crypto platforms like coinbase or coingecko, methods which you can use in your data collection could be in data sampling or through questionaire, but has be coincise amd accurate, and lastly, i will like to know if bitcoin or cryptocurrency is applicable and related to your former degree program so as not to create a waste of effort.

### Reply 2:
Excuse me for not replying earlier, I was way too busy with exams.A year ago, I conducted a search for Covid-19, it was honestly a fascinating subject and one I could find information relatively easy. However, I've already done it once, thus, I'd rather find a subject that isn't medical related this time. Wikipedia itself isn't considered a valid source for academical purposes, but it does include the sources the page used.Good idea, could probably do something blockchain related along with Bitcoin perhaps, while it's an emerging and promising technology and a research on such a subject would be a huge plus.Thank you for your detailed reply, will definitely look into a few of those ideas you mentioned. My main goal here is to find a topic that appeals to me, but also includes a statistical/data analysis to make it more interesting and actually indicate something.

In the second chapter of the book ""Outliers: The Story of Success"" Malcolm Gladwell wrote about the 10 000-Hour Rule.According to Gladwell, the two(2) factors that contribute to achieving mastery or expertise in any field are:1) The number of hours of practiceGladwell posits that the magic number for true expertise is ten thousand hours of focused and deliberate practice. For example, he told the story of Bill Joy, one of the most influential figures in modern computing, and Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft and one of the richest men in the world. They both achieved expertise in their fields by spending an enormous amount of time focused on programming. As an undergraduate student at the University of Michigan, Bill Joy was programming around eight or ten hours a day. And when he enrolled as a graduate student at the University of California at Berkeley, he was doing it day and night. Bill Gates spent around twenty or thirty hours every week programming as a high school student.While I do not entirely agree with the 10,000-hour rule, I firmly believe that attaining mastery or expertise in any field is directly proportional to the number of hours spent deliberately focused on le<rest of post truncated>

Regarding the question though,1. I don't understand what you mean by practicing bitcoin, nevertheless as per my experience when I started my journey, I spend hours learning bitcoin wallets. Because for me this is important as obviously this is where you stash your bitcoin. So I read about different kind of wallets etc. But I'm not sure how many hours I logged in because bitcoin investment is a journey.2. Series of opportunities? again, this is all based on my experience. Learning to play with my wallet, and understanding the tx fees, custodial vs non-custodial. So I hone my skills as I practice and as I go thru the routines.

### Reply 2:
There are course in Bitcoin. Antonopolos has an ebook Mastering Bitcoin, you wouldn't need 10K hours for that. But Programming will definitely require a ton of practise for someone to become an expert.If you mean master in trading Bitcoin,that 10K hour may apply but you must be a slow learner to spend that much time and money before seeing the pattern in Bitcoin chart.

Topic: 2009 coins on the move? Probably not Satoshi
### Original post:
Before there's more wild speculation about where these old coins that moved came from... Let's remember that bitcoin was revealed publicly by satoshi upon release. An archive of the emails posted by satoshi can be seen here: <link> People were in theory able to become part of the network and use bitcoin, mine and transact with equal access as satoshi himself onward from the genesis block. Especially a month in the opperation. By some of the early participants that publicly showed interest, its obvious that one of the earliest adopters of bitcoin was Hal Finney (may he rest in peace). This is all public information verified by the record of the same mailing list. While we can't be sure who had mined the block that went in the address <truncated> specifically, we also shouldn't assume that those coins were lost. For example, Hal had admitted storing keys for coins he had mined for his family. Here's Hal on the matter:Not to rush to assumptions also, there's no evidence to suggest that these coins were Hal's for sure either! Hal's online trail is just evidence that it's more realistic to expect those coins being connected to an early bitcoin enthusiast other than Satoshi himself. For <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
I don't think Satoshi who moved this coins either. Hal could be a likely candidate and so are the dozens early miners. And for the record though, this is not the first time we have seen an old address which move 50 BTC. The last time we have seen this is 2017.<link> is also interesting to note that the last time we seen this kind of movement, the price went -3%-5% but it was followed by a big upward trend, 20%-30%. I'm not saying that it could happened again. Also, this is good news for blockchain analyst or shall I call them ""blockchain archeologist"".

### Reply 2:
This is making rounds on crypto related media already. And it seems that this news has affected the price negatively. And I'm also thinking that maybe some bad actors are going to take advantage of this news and create FUD. So just be careful guys, make your own conclusions and not just push that sell button if you hear someone tells that the price will go down hard because of this news.

Topic: Anonymity with BTC via XMR
### Original post:
Hello,I know its better to use only XMR to make sure to stay anonymous. However some merchants still dont accept monero, and somtimes people also just want to pay you with BTC.So what do you think of following anonymity plan regarding BTC usage (combined with XMR):BTC Address W (mine, not anonym) -> BTC Address X (controlled by Morpthoken service, converts to XMR. this is input address for conversion)XMR Address A (controlled by Morphtoken, output address) -> XMR Address B (mine) -> XMR Address C (controlled by XMR.to service, converts to BTC. this is input address for conversion)BTC Address Y (controlled by XMR.to service, output address) -> BTC Address Z (mine, anonym) -> BTC Address V (merchant)So the coins from the first BTC address shouldnt be traceable to the last BTC address. Assume also that for each transaction you use different amount at different time.And since we use also two different conversion services you make sure that the services self arent a weak point (and do not require registration).What do you think of this anonymity/privacy plan? I think it is far more recommended than using any BTC mixing service (many are proven to be unsecure).

### Reply 1:
I reckon it'll likely just him trying to hide where his bitcoin is from, and also from what addresses/how much BTC he might have.If you're going through all the hassle to exchange bitcoin to XMR, it could likely work with any coin. ETH, XRP, they would all be extremely hard to track unless the exchange or mixer gives up your details, otherwise, you should be fine.There might be something perfect for this - have you seen privcoin? They do multicurrency mixing (deposit BTC, get ETH, etc).

### Reply 2:
first of all, thank you all for the feedback!well its not like i did something very illegal. I just want to go sure. Anonymity is important for me.The concept I suggested has one advantage: anonymity is assured by monero which is open source. Those mixer services are mostly not open-source and have more likely a vulnerability than monero.and yes both services (morpthoken and xmr.to) have no KYC, no registrationYes the fee's are def a con. I already tried it, its smth about 5% fee in total.@BitMaxz, thats a very interesting method. Heard that first time that a ""mixing"" service doesnt actually mix but use new coins. I will have a look. The good thing is, you can verify that the coins are new.Edit: cant see on the chipmixer website, that they mention to use new coins :S ?

Topic: Validation speed for bitcoin transactions.
### Original post:
I did some research on Bitcoin transaction but I wasn't too clear on some things.Bitcoin transaction fees are the rewards miners get when they verify transactions therefore the bigger the transaction fees the more inclined miners would be to verify the block.Does this mean that if two Bitcoin transactions are carried out simultaneously, the transaction with larger block chargess would likely be validated before that of lower transaction fees?Also aside from network congestion which can be avoided by transacting when the network is less populated and transaction size , how does block space demand affect transaction fees?

### Reply 1:
Every time you make a transaction that isy correctly signed and broadcasted to the network, Bitcoin nodes will verify it and include it in the mempool. When it comes to getting your transaction confirmed, the ones with a higher fee per byte will catch the miners' attention and make it into the block before the ones with lower fees. Miners typically favor transactions with higher fees as it increases their mining profits.Block space is limited, so if, for example, there are thousands of transactions in the mempool that pay 20 sat/vB, you will have to offer a higher fee for your transaction to be included in the block ahead of them.

### Reply 2:
Op you have said it all, in your first paragraph. Mining is the solving of mathematical problem in the blockchain and the transaction with the highest fee is always mine first before the other ones. But if the two transactions fees are very close then after the first one the other will be mine but the fees have very big margin then you have to want for some minutes for the first highest fees to be mine. As others as said the input address can also cause the transaction fee that be high. And the congestion is caused by the surplus demand in the blockchain.

Topic: Binance CEO Warns Users About Phishing Scam
### Original post:
Quote <truncated> Alert ! Binance CEO Warns Users About A Phishing Scam.CZ Binance didn't reveal how the phishing scammers were able to get the phone numbers of binance users. Was binance breached? If so, how much data was exposed? I dont believe an attack on Binance security was ever mentioned. I have to ask how safe is our bitcoins on centralized exchanges, how safe is our information (kyc) on these exchanges?

### Reply 1:
Once you do sent out your information to these platforms then never ever put up into your mind that those info would be 100% safe.Binance didn't mentioned out on how these numbers been leaked out?There's no other way these scammers/hackers do able to get number of those users unless if they are leaked or been breached out so its safe to presume that this had been likely the case.Well, if you do make use of your own common sense then these problems or possible phishing attempts could be spotted right on the spot.

### Reply 2:
And many users use the same username / email / password across many platforms. So if they got that information from another breach, although the scammers would not be able to log in without access to your 2FA, they would know it's a valid account. So that would allow a bit better targeted phishing scam.As always not your keys not your coins....-Dave

Topic: I didn't know IP addresses was used to send bitcoin
### Original post:
Recently doing some research about the end of using IP addresses to generate public keys for bitcoin transactions and it seemed that Theymos was not in support of it; from the long argument it resulted to in the forum. Though, others had seen it as an insecure means of transacting BTC, it makes no difference keeping the IP address method. It's my first time of finding such tech about bitcoin, and I don't think the method stood the test of time before it was removed from the network. Found it from a rare picture of bitcoin org website posted on twitter by Rizzo. And to know that bitcoin was also sent using the forum as a vehicle or wallet intrigued me to say that it was just a small amount of people that started the journey of bitcoin, and bitcoin has seen lots of changes in the technology. <link>

### Reply 1:
I could see a lot of issues arising from using an IP address to transact coins. A domain name, maybe that would have been cool. If it worked similar to Binance's internal transfers, I guess that would increase privacy however I could only see a lot of work having been done for it to have functioned as intended. It would be kind of like a giant lightning network, which took years to perfect on a per-channel basis (let alone an entire network basis). Very interesting though. I had no idea about this!

### Reply 2:
I like how everything ended without much debate even though both 2 masters (satoshi & theymos) were in support of the ip address option. The main thing that almost persuaded me in Theymos argument is that the ip alternative can help keep data out of the Blockchain( I actually don't want my Blockchain to be filled up quickly esp with heavy data). Unfortunately this broke the most important ideal of Bitcoin, which is Immutablity(satoshi seems to have solution for anonymity/privacy issue this can also create) . Once an ideal is violated you just have to prepare for the worst.

Topic: Bitcoin comes first and blockchain comes later
### Original post:
We see Bitcoin and blockchain in many places, but most of us do not know their relationship. Coupled with media reports from different governments, it is easier to confuse the relationship.We can often see this media view: Bitcoin uses blockchain as the underlying technology. Seeing this sentence, for the vast majority of ordinary people, they will definitely confuse the relationship between Bitcoin and the blockchain. They would think that blockchain technology was born first, and then Bitcoin was born. This is why many governments ban Bitcoin but not blockchain. They will advertise that blockchain is a very good and very advanced technology. But Bitcoin is a very risky asset and a bad thing.Now that I write this topic, I just want to emphasize this point: Bitcoin was born first, and then blockchain technology. Rather than the first-born blockchain technology, the second-born Bitcoin. I think this is a very important point, and it is necessary for us to spread it to all friends around us who are concerned about Bitcoin.In 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin and the Bitcoin network began to operate. Then in the following three to five years, scientific and technological personne<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Your answer is exactly the question I emphasized. First of all, Bitcoin is fundamentally different from the Internet. What the Internet mainly does is the transmission of information, and what Bitcoin realizes is the transfer of value. They are two completely different dimensional technologies. At the same time, blockchain and Bitcoin were not born at the same time. In my opinion, in the first three years or even five years before the birth of Bitcoin, there was no concept of blockchain at all. At the same time, Bitcoin was treated as a scam at that time. Until various technical personnel continued to study the technical principles of Bitcoin, and finally extracted the blockchain technology from the realization of Bitcoin.

### Reply 2:
I think the two are inseparable otherwise you will likely not have safe/good Bitcoin. It's more like fruits and the nutrients in them ... You can't say I like the fruits but not the nutrients. The fruits were built for the nutrients for our enjoyment and health. Those who dislike the nutrients will probably drain the fruits off nutrients and fill it synthetic stuff or things that fruits are not designed to contain

Topic: A Ukrainian top university offering a course on Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies
### Original post:
I am currently doing my Master's program in one of the best universities in Ukraine. Now that the country is on the lockdown due to COVID-19, more and more courses are moving online, especially to our university's online learning platform. So I was minding my own business and checking out the materials on the course I am taking, when I decided to take a look at some other courses available on the platform. And among them, I surprisingly found this course called 'The basics and Blockchain and cryptocurrencies' for 3-year Bachelor's program students. I'm attaching a photo as a proof, but it's in Ukrainian, of course. Just so I can tell you more, I enrolled in the course to see the overview (system bug doesn't allow taking a look at what they're studying without enrolling). Here's a list of topics they cover: Decentralized databases, attacks on Bitcoin, consensus type, crypto exchanges, functions of money and cryptocurrencies, cryptocurrency types and trading basics. So the course is definitely pro-crypto, and let me reiterate that it's a part of a Bachelor's program in Computer sciences in one of the most popular universities in my country (National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy)<rest of post truncated>

I would refer you guys to download edxIt does have amazing courses related to cryptocurrencies and at the same time it is free , you can learn ,pass tests and at the same time you can even ask questions on the board and the courses are sponsored by very reputed Universities all around the world. You can even get your certificate on edx. ( That would be paid though ) But never hurts to gain knowledge.

### Reply 2:
Well, being a top university all over Ukraine, I suppose the screening process for lecturers and/or professors and whatever curriculum they propose are never below standard. The university must have experts hired before opening such course for interested students. Any teaching staff and subjects must have duly passed the stringent scrutiny of the specific college or department this course falls under before finally approved by the university itself. Although online resources are really vast, I believe it is always best to learn alongside someone who's an expert and who will guide you along the way. Self-education could also be done while undergoing a more structured learning process. And, of course, it is hard to tell which online course or material is legit, more effective, complete, and so on all by yourself. The academe is indeed fast adapting to the latest technological developments. This must not be too surprising considering that the university is among the leading educational institution in the country. By the way, just last year, I was also surprised when a group of young teenagers from a university in one of the leading cities in my country making the news for winning silv<rest of post truncated>

Topic: Could this be a bullish sign as halving approaches?
### Original post:
Price fluctuations may be an indicator of investor sentiment. Hashrate, though, is often seen as the better market number to watch in order to truly evaluate Bitcoin adoption, and recent hashrate statistics indicate that adoption continues to grow.By all accounts, Bitcoin has had quite a tumultuous year. After starting the year more than 80% down from its all-time high, BTC recovered significantly before once again losing several thousands of dollars in value.Source link hereFor me, I think this could be another ""unsure"" prediction or analysis.Although the hashrate of Bitcoin has increased significantly, this isn't guaranteed that Bitcoin will be having a big bull run when halving draws near. Remember that there are still scammers out there like PlusToken, lurking from the shadows, waiting to strike when BTC moons, then they dump a lot of their assets to bring the market down again. I can't be sure if the increased hashrate of Bitcoin would really become ""bullish"" because the market today is so unpredictable. What do you guys think?

### Reply 1:
I dont know but we dont have to worry, the halving is fast approaching & the price should start to slowly rise as we get towards it. The real fireworks will be in 2021 though.

### Reply 2:
logically it will increase the price of bitcoin, but the fact is no one can guess with certainty the state of the market, Hopefully the price can really go up in 2020, crypto holders certainly hope so too, according to my analysis if the price is able to penetrate 8000 it is likely that prices will experience a sharp increase, but if it is not able to penetrate this number, it is likely that the downtrend still dominates the market.

### Reply 1:
OP, you have done well to bring up this information here and it will really help newbies and those who haven't bought bitcoin yet. I will prefer the regular DCA method because this is the best way one can keep on accumulating more bitcoin, in order to increase his bitcoin portfolio gradually. DCA doesn't bother about the price of bitcoin at that moment either it is pumping or dumping because it is a continuous process and you are investing for a long period of time, maybe 8-10 years. Buying at the dip is also good but the disadvantage is that one have to wait till the price dips and at that time you might have spent the funds that you budgeted down for buying at the dip, which will lead to regrets at the end of the day. What matters is for you to have a proper plan of amount that you will assign for regular DCA based on your income. DCA approach is the best strategy for beginners, but if you have accumulated up to your target amount of bitcoin, then you can consider buying at the dip as a good strategy. Patience is the key to long term investment and DCA helps you accumulate with ease.

### Reply 2:
Exactly right on point. It is my mindset when I started doing the DCA (dollar-cost averaging) mid-last year regardless of the market condition, cycle, etc. I honestly have less belief in cycles in which anything can change unexpectedly without warning. This is why even if BTC went downhill last time, I was not concerned that much and I just kept on doing DCA. I always make sure that the money Ive saved for family and emergency is my top priority and investments are at the very least in the priority list.It is important about educating ourselves with the right mindset and approach when it comes to money management and financial situations regardless if were single or having our own families.

If Indian Central Bank and Reserve Bank remove all kinds of restrictions on cryptocurrency traders, Then obviously a revolution will take place in India. Seeing this, It will inspire the countries around India. Then cryptocurrency will be used and spread in a real way.

### Reply 2:
Its been a long time indian crypto entrepreneurs and users are facing government restrictions on bitcoin. In a situation like this their central banks decision about bitcoin will give them little relief atleast. Hopefully bitcoin community is going to get bigger with the wave of huge indian population. Indians peoples are fond of new technologies and as a result massive number of new people will get introduce with bitcoin.In addition I think bitcoin gonna add another extra pace to their economical growth. Specially in e-commerce business indian people will be able to choose the option of hassle-free bitcoin payment. Lets hope for the best.

Topic: Crypto regulation in the EU and the USA
### Original post:
Can anyone give me an update about the latest news regarding crypto regulation?I'm European.The European Commission is the only body of the EU with the power to make laws. They are currently trying to regulate crypto currencies via MiCA law (Market in Crypto Assets).There is no transparency about the law, but certain aspects have been leaked. The EU wants exchanges to verify all transactions with regards to money laundering or fraud. Pretty much like the staff of banks either approve or disprove of your transaction.I don't think this is realistic. It violates privacy of users and it also makes them prone to being hacked. The law is expected to be finalized in october of 2022. 4 weeks from now. If exchanges (coinbase, binance..) can not live up to these regulations, how will that affect the price of cryptos?People could say that it would kill crypto. Some channels on YouTube do.Others (me) could see this as an investment opportunity.

### Reply 1:
Strengthening the regulation of cryptocurrencies by states is inevitable. To do this, states have a lot of leverage. Exchanges registered and operating on the territory of states will be forced to comply with their rules, which relate to the fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Otherwise, states may close the operation of such exchanges. Here it is only important that the states approach this issue in a balanced way.

### Reply 2:
Care to tell how?[/quote]I'm not in the market so far. I always believed in the technology but I also believed, from the beginning, that government would fight back against crypto.And that is happening right now. The crooked central banks want to keep their monopoly on finance and they will use regulation (""we must stop money laundering"") to do so. I just wonder who will win in the end. An other argument that the EU is using against bitcoin particularly, is that it would generate too much CO2 emission. Which of course is a poor excuse, but they will use that argument. I'm hoping that when this law gets passed, there will be more clarity about options to exchange crypto assets. In secrecy, and with no banks involved. If banks and governments are involved, they will either tax it or confiscate it.I'm not an expert, but when exchanges get overregulated by government I don't see how a complete crash in value of crypto assets can be avoided.And that is when I'll get in. If you believe that all of this is BS, feel free to tell me.

Topic: Leading crypto wallet adds Bluetooth support for mobile bitcoin access
### Original post:
<link> Ledger Nano X will be accessible through the Ledger Live mobile appOn Sunday at CES, the crypto wallet company Ledger revealed its latest device the Bluetooth-enabled Ledger Nano X. The device is roughly similar to the previous Nano S, offering more support for multiple wallets and coin types but leaving internals otherwise the same. But Bluetooth will allow the X to connect to mobile devices through the new Ledger Live app, a powerful new way to access hardware wallets through your phone.Hardware wallets let you hold bitcoin locally without keeping them in an exchange, a more flexible version of simply writing down your key on a piece of paper. The devices typically require a PIN to unlock and support multiple physical devices tied to the same key, providing strong protection against theft or accidental loss. Ledgers previous hardware wallet, the Nano S, was a favorite among many in the community. Ledger CEO Eric Larchevque has said the Nano S will fall in price after the Nano X is released.Adding Bluetooth may be controversial. Wallets typically connect over USB, and any wireless capability raises the risk of unauthorized access. Still, the hardware-level PIN protections (<rest of post truncated>

Hi im hoping this is the correct forum to post inive recently been trying to setup a prunde BTC node, however im struggling to get it to work (im sure im just being really stupid)so ive basically followed the install instructions from <link> also edited the config file however my 40GB VPS seems to fill up and the pruning is not working is there any more upto date tutorials on how this is done or if someone could give me some advise id be really grateful TIA

### Reply 1:
A few troubleshooting steps from my side:Have you checked if you created the bitcoin.conf file on the right path? It should have been created in <truncated> the configuration file, what value have you put after the prune variable? Make sure that you save the file after done editing the config file.Also note that while you will end up running a pruned node, the client still downloads the full blockchain but it prunes the data (according to the value in the prune variable) as it goes along so make sure your VPS has enough bandwidth for the operation to happen. As for guides, albeit written in 2019, I believe these[1] instructions are still valid.[1]<link>

Topic: we deserve to have bitcoin
### Original post:
It is unfair that bitcoin being a different digital money system something more egalitarian, at least not unlimited like fiat, has become so inaccessible to the people who really need it. I feel that having 1 million satoshis in a few thousand years will make you a millionaire and a more equal and free person. But what sense does it make to buy with your fiat money as many bitcoin as possible to become a millionaire and then sell it for more fiat money? I think this will make bitcoin more expensive for people who really want the currency, not to exchange it for more fiat money or other crypto, but because we know that keeping bitcoin will be fighting for a less corrupt world and those who don't have it can have something. I look forward to reach that peak of $3300 to also have the right to be part of this. <link>

### Reply 1:
I complain about people who want to become millionaires that way. I know it's not, I complain about something else.

### Reply 2:
OP, I looked at your profile. You signed up in 2017. And also, then you asked whether it is possible to get 1 bitcoin without mining.I think you've missed your opportunity a bit. After all, if you had been buying a little bit of bitcoin since 2017, and had been patient, you would now say otherwise.But there are a lot of people like you. Therefore, without waiting ""several thousand years,"" you still have the opportunity to become the owner of Bitcoin. Just be a little optimistic in your predictions.

Topic: Is It Late To Invest In Bitcoin?
### Original post:
I am a 20-year-old student. Not long ago, I heard a famous cryptocurrency expert in Korea on YouTube. He said, ""Bitcoin investment seems to be late, to be honest. I'm sad, too. I think 2018 was the last chance for ordinary people.""This makes me feel depressed. That expert started investing in bitcoin in 2013, and he encouraged his acquaintances to invest in bitcoin, but at that time he said everyone thought he was crazy.Honestly, as an ordinary college student, the price of bitcoin now feels too much to buy.. If it's the price of the early 2010s, I might have bought it through a part-time job..I'm so pathetic and depressed because I didn't know Bitcoin quickly. What should I do?

### Reply 1:
The truth of the fact is that there is never any time late to invest in Bitcoin, but just that the problem has always been the users ability to hold on for dear life (i.e HODL), which also means the users ability to hold he/her Bitcoin investment for a very long period of time. Because I'm sure you must have heard the famous story about ""Bitcoin Pizza"", which is all about a guy who paid 10,000 BItcoin for just mere 2 pizzas back then in 2010. So imagine if had this man kept his 10,000 BTC til today at current price of $34,000 per BTC. By today that man would have been a proud holder of $340 million valued of BTC in his wallet.Henceforth, it's not all about when you bought your BTC, but how far where you able to hold for long that matters.

### Reply 2:
Please don't allow anyone to deceive you because you're not late to the party and whoever said that does not know what Bitcoin really is. I didn't know about Bitcoin until lately and I'm happily buying at any slightest opportunity. The fact that you didn't buy during the early stage doesn't make you late. If bitcoin price could rise from few cents to $35k, imagine what the price could be in the next 10 years. So you can start your Bitcoin journey which is going to be an interesting ride by buying a lump sum or through DCA.

Topic: Blockchain Technology ""bottled"" up
### Original post:
Read the full story: <link> is always good news to hear that companies are exploring the possibilities that blockchain technology can bring. Even if they are not using Bitcoin, it is still helping the community. I think some people are oftentimes looking into their own self-interest and thinking about the ""profits"" which is why Bitcoin is always the front of the conversation. However, some other good things are happening in the cryptocurrency space that doesn't offer an immediate investment. Thoughts?

### Reply 1:
If we take out the scammers, thieves and hackers out of the equation, there are still some really good things happening behind the scenes to make finance accessible and more inclusive to people form all backgrounds and financial situations. This can bring a whole new meaning to life for so many people aorund the world and also in a geopolitical framework where we see mass migrations due to economic hardship, we might see this put to an end a smore and mroe people prosper in their own countries due to the changes Bitcoin and the Blockchain technology itself can bring. People don't realise that this is bigger than all of us and our own perosnal dreams. If we all see the significance of this revolution, we will all act a little differently and more sociably responsible too.

### Reply 2:
I have always had this strong feeling that the global adoption of blockchain technology would take place soon whiles its twin partner cryptocurrencies would take quite a long time. It's a great feeling to hear such a big company like Coca Cola stepping up on the front to adopt the blockchain technology. This would serve as a good exposure about the technology to other equally famous industries across the globe.

Topic: What's happening with Bitcoin transaction fees?
### Original post:
I was checking mempool and saw the transaction fee sky rocketing. I am not sure what happened suddenly as these fees are way beyond anyone's imagination. Later on, I did found out that Binance has listed Ordinals (ORDI). I want to ask the community whether the severe high transaction fee occured because of the listing? I went ahead and check the price of $ORDI on Binance and found that it is trading at a price which is way beyond it should be. I am sharing the screenshot below.Anyone here who can give a solution to this issue? I feel they would continue to make the transaction fee in those Satoshi figures . This situation would not help small investors and traders as they would avoid these kinds of transaction fees. Edited on 10th of November 2023As expected it is now beyond the control of anyone except those who were part of the development. They should come up with a solution otherwise the whole idea would crumbled. Look at this after I posted before the current price.This has to stop or everything that was beautiful would become a nightmare. Those who created it have to come out of a unique solution. These fees are insane and out of the limit of anyone who is like me. Imagine so<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Yeah it seems there many stupid people want to get tricked by Ordinal again, that because Binance is now start accepting this shitcoin.It will not affect traders, they're leave their coins in centralized exchange and even they want to withdraw their coins, CEX is charge a fixed fee regardless the situation on mempool.

### Reply 2:
Having experience in this regards is not something new anymore, this is to tell us how the network is busy or congested, but we can always manuever our own way through, try to use a bitcoin wallet like electrum which support RBF, adjust your transactions to the lowest priority, apply the option of static and set the limit to about 20 Satoshi per vbyte, make your payment and use the transaction id to pump your transaction, use via btc to make your transaction faster since it's a mining pool and it's free, another thing you can do is to target weekend transactions or study the mempool when it's less congested.

After the return of Bitcoin to a level above 10 thousand, we again observe the fomo effect, where peoples topals begin to look for information on how to start investing. Of course, most of them restrict themselves to a basic study of the topic, and I think a documentary from Netflix about cryptocurrencies will only throw firewood into the fire to strengthen the trend. But of course, no secrets of how to trade people will not extract from there.

You are welcome.Peter Schiff has very good points against Bitcoin and very good points about Gold, let's help ourselves and stop saying gold has no value !!As for Bitcoin, the price is extremely unstable and most people use it to trade or profit from a fiat currency nominal appreciation but it would be interesting that he also makes more positive arguments for Bitcoin to show you understand the value it can have. Bitcoin has 2 huge values :-The fact you can digitally hide money just by being careful about how you get your bitcoins and transfer them. For example, you can use a mixer or buy new coins from a miner.-The value in your bitcoins can never be seized nor have third party risk if you save it yourself, not on a digital wallet or an exchange.Yes your bitcoins can lose 90% of their value but this value you have is hidden, yours for ever and can appreciate in value as well. You know funds in most banks or safes can be seized or freezed by a government for or an institution for many reasons : financial, political or just to transfer the value to someone else : your associate, your debtor, your ex-wife.There are huge legal and fiscal risks in Bitcoin but the probability that the w<rest of post truncated>

Well, in space as well we are limited by the speed of light (it takes more than 3 minutes to reach just Mars. But anyway - there was an article recently, that there is 210km big golden asteroid within our Solar System. If we know how to mine it relatively cheaply, gold would lose its investment value (just as once it happened with aluminium). Next argument for cryptocurrency.

Topic: What is your Average Bitcoin Buying Price?
### Original post:
I am really curious to know what is the average bitcoin buying price or the average price you bought BTC at in your portfolio currently?Also, If you can comment that would be great. I want to see if there is any relation between Forum Rank and Bitcoin Average Price buying.

### Reply 1:
This is hard because for Person like me that there is no consistent price to buy ? i think i will just vote for thebelow 25k for now as i have already holding my target amount now .but of course if given a chance to add in the value i can afford to buy then why not.that's what we have now to buy at that range because Bitcoin seemingly not going to fall under 20kagain.well not this year i believe.

### Reply 2:
If there's going to be a correlation, it's likely going to be a non-airdropped merit count than rank. With the assumption that high non-airdropped merit count is equal to high Bitcoin/crypto knowledge; hence probably higher likeliness to buy and not panic sell in bear markets.

Topic: Intriguing: Disruptive Technology To Upend All Banks
### Original post:
Sooooo, I decided to start a blog...I hope no one minds my self promotion. :-)<link> Disruptive Technology To Upend All BanksFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThe latest word on the Internet is the ""bitcoin"", a new type of crypto-currency that has the potential to upend all banking systems around the world. What exactly is a bitcoin? According to its main website, bitcoin.org, it is a new type of currency based on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, which means that there is no central authority to regulate it. Unlike the U.S. dollar, which is mostly regulated by federal banks, the P2P currency cannot be affected by the monetary policy of any government. It is impossible, by logical and mathematical design, that the price of the bitcoin could be artificially manipulated by human intervention. This mere fact gives bitcoin the potential to disrupt the entire banking industry.Many governments of different countries have had a role in manipulating their currency in an attempt to remain competitive. The United States, China, Zimbabwe, etc., have all influenced their respective monetary policies by using currency manipulation techniques. The U.S. Federal Reserve System (informally known as the ""Fed"") raise<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
But can you artificially disrupt it? For instance, in the case of Zimbabwe they re-denominated their currency which is 'artificial'. I don't think this can be done with bitcoin.

### Reply 2:
This was immediately in my mind.It's easier to 'artificially' drive the price up than down though, that's for sure.

Topic: Will Bitcoin fail if Satoshi is found?
### Original post:
It's now 10 years since Bitcoin was created, yet many people are wondering who Satoshi Nakamoto might be. It's still today, where the creator of Bitcoin has hidden his/her identity well from the general public. All attempts in finding who created the world's most popular cryptocurrency have failed so far. But we all know that there's no such thing as 100% anonymity. A slight error in covering tracks, could expose your identity within the mainstream world.Now, imagine if the real Satoshi's identity is found. If he/she is still alive, governments would be on his/her tail to put him/her in jail or even pay a hefty sum of taxes. Once this happens, Bitcoin might fail within the mainstream world. Of course, the community is what makes Bitcoin great. But I'm sure that the reveal of Satoshi's identity will have an influence (either positive or negative) over the cryptocurrency's price and reputation worldwide.What are the odds of Bitcoin's survival once Satoshi is found? Will it continue to operate as is? Or will it fail in the long run?

### Reply 1:
By now even if they find out, it will be too late. The experiment has started and is now well decentralized. At the beginning Satoshi would have been passivable for blackmail and/or extortion.

### Reply 2:
Jail?! What crime did he commit? Regarding taxes, bitcoins were worthless in the early mining days -- there weren't even liquid markets and price discovery until sometime in 2010 -- so I don't see much tax liability stemming from his CPU mining. And presumably he hasn't realized any capital gains since the ""Satoshi coins"" haven't moved.Would it survive? Yes. Would it be compromised? Probably. I would hate to see Bitcoin with its own version of Vitalik Buterin. That would be heartbreaking.

I have always rejected them as someone's figment if imagination. Recently I read thisRothschild Invest $60 Million into CryptoI am also aware that Rothschild family is associated with illuminaties,that made me believe some of theories that BTC is actually created and promotes by illuminaties to achieve their goal of creating new world order.

So they've created it, they're promoting it, but they didn't buy at under 1$, or under 200$, or under 1000$, they'll invest now...Would this mean that until now they didn't believe in the product they created and they promoted?Does this truly make sense for you? Really?

what do you think those rich people grow their money from? investment. I mean almost all of the rich people are investing somewhere else and this time rothschild happens to invest into grayscale and I see it as a normal thing.If crypto was really pushed to be this popular as part of their agenda they should've owned major amount of cryptocurrency but nah they instead invest to it when it's already hyped up since a year ago and kinda late not to mention they are doing it indirectly like through grayscale if i'm not mistaken.

Topic: How bitcoin self custody  will help reduce future bear market.
### Original post:
Is no loner news that Bitcoin movement to cold wallet have been on the increase since 2022 when the Bitcoin market faced one of its most drained bear market, and the reason for such value decrease is not far-fetched as it is attributed to the collapse of several centralized platforms, ranging from the exchange and another investment platform such as Genesis and FTX crisis.Knowing this reality that Bitcoin on its own can not easily slide into such a bear market, and all the Bitcoin bear markets have been influenced by the activities of those centralized exchanges and their shortcomings, their inability has been the cause of all the crisis rocking Bitcoin and the general cryptocurrency market stabilities.Bitcoin holders are beginning to drive joy in the self-custody of their coins, and this has been reflected in the increase in Bitcoin movement from exchange to custodial wallets where the holder has 100% control. And for me, this action is going to bring about long-term stability and a minimal occurrence of a bear market most especially a market crash-like bear condition, because if a large number of Bitcoin holders move their Bitcoin into the cold wallet, it will reduce the over dep<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Something must lead to a bear market, If it is not the CEX, it will be something else.Bear Markets results from factors that we cannot control, so no matter how many people in cryptocurrency practice self custody, there will always be a bear market for some other reasons.It will not be pragmatic to expect a bull market and no occurrence of an event that will really affect the price of bitcoins negatively.

### Reply 2:
I think that a lot of market makers are using extreme forms of leverage to manipulate markets and get funds from their customers. Trading helps give them profits to leverage and depositing coins gives them fuel for manipulation. Eventually the thought is enough people will self custody causing market manipulators to crash like FTX as they run out of customer funds to play with.

Topic: Is regulations among the key factors that affect the price of Bitcoin
### Original post:
Is regulations among the key factors that affects the price of Bitcoin

### Reply 1:
It absolutely is. Here's the thing, technically every country on the planet could ban bitcoin but that would not shut bitcoin down, of course, since it's a decentralized cryptocurrency. You've got decentralized exchanges as well as always OTC sales/trades (over the counter) which can be done and the government can't do anything about it (I guess unless you get caught).However, if say the US gov banned bitcoin, it would spell a major disaster for bitcoin. This would mean no exchanges would be allowed to operate in the US, and a very large portion of bitcoiners would never buy bitcoin again. Most people need simplicity, hence why so many people use Coinbase (Con-base) and then simply leave their coins on the exchange. People are also lazy, so finding alternatives will drive a lot of people out.

### Reply 2:
Maybe a bit, but we need to remember that its not the only factor neither. We are talking about just one part of it and that matters. I think its important to remember that we are at a global scale and this is a currency as well, sometimes we forget that its a currency and think of it just like its an asset, but its also a currency. This means that we are going to end up with a lot of volatility, so when one factor like this moves it up or down, another factor could make it balance and not move. Lets say a bad regulation news comes out and it will go down, then amazon may come out and say they will accept bitcoin and then price wouldn't move too much. This is why its important to remember its not just a single factor.

Topic: Patience above all will be rewarded here
### Original post:
Rome wasn't built in a day, and Bitcoin won't take off to the moon right now. It will take a lot of improvement, a lot of new technology and a lot of hard work.The people who buy in rallies and sell during bear markets and then don't believe in bitcoin anymore are clowns. If the price went to 25k in the next few months I guarantee it that the community will double maybe even quadruple in just a few days.And then if it dropped back to 15k, suddenly most of these people will disappear again. They won't believe in bitrcoin and they will not care. If you don't want your money to be created by bankers and the government at their whim the actual price of bitcoin is secondary. Bitcoin is a central part of the puzzle when it comes to the people getting back their sovereignty.

### Reply 1:
Don't call them clowns. You may have taken advantage of their ignorance by dumping on them but you can still show a little empathy. I'm sure you have heard stories of taking loans, selling houses, using all life savings to buy bitcoin and sold at a huge loss. Maybe some of them wanted to try again but decided not to go buy because of the mocking they received when they made a costly mistake.Bitcoin will go to ""moon"" and the patience will be rewarded because there will be ""clowns"", as you call them, who will be buying at rallies again.

### Reply 2:
I don't think everyone quits. The ones that join the community due to the price rise, gets to know about about bitcoin and the technology. They learn about the past of the bitcoin and then they understand that the price has always been volatile. They get interested and they end up staying over here. Only those who came for the profit, runs away.Again, this sudden rise also starts to help us spread more knowledge about bitcoin!You really think bitcoin is going to replace the banks?

Topic: Global Debt to be Worth $12 Million per Bitcoin by Year End
### Original post:
The IIF report said that that global debt will achieve $255 trillion by 2020. The growth of this debt comes from governments, non-financial and governments companies. This year the USA's government debt has increased on $30 trillion, besides, companies added $25 trillion, households $9 trillion and banks $2 trillion. ""Instead of entering a decade of stagnation, central banks poured in liquidity to boost all sectors, leading to significant asset valuation growth. In spite of that, the financial sector carries debt which is 240% of the worlds gross domestic product. Bitcoin Still Valued Low in Comparison to Size of Financial Sector"", an article on Bitcoinist said. If bitcoins value was matched to real economic output, it would be about 60% lower, at around $4 million per BTC. One bitcoin will have to be worth over $12 million to describe the size of the worldwide debt.What do you guys think about the relationship of bitcoin to worldwide debt?

### Reply 1:
if the amount of bitcoin adoption growth worldwide increases then that will also make the price and value of bitcoin continue to increase, if the price of bitcoin reaches $ 12 million to meet world debt payments, all governments will go in favor of bitcoin and take over to pay debts, but unfortunately they haven't doing this step, lots of things and advantages for each country adopting bitcoin and cryptocurrency, if only they didn't ban it in their country and discarding their hypocrisy in adopting bitcoin or other crypto currencies, but if bitcoin is worth $ 1 million I would like to see would what will be the attitude of the government in this world to bitcoin and cryptocurrency?

### Reply 2:
Seems rather strange to compare the debt to the price of Bitcoin as if somehow all financial institutions and assets are going to disappear and be substituted by crypto? Not all financial value exists in liquid cash. They're backed up my physical resources or physical commodities and the debt for countries that are backed by good economies (ie the US) are inflated anyways. That's not saying the debt needs to be reduced but the idea of 20 trillion in debt doesn't mean the U.S. economy is doomed.

CMC if you want the average of all listed exchanges. It's pretty controversial though because they also have crappy <truncated> exchanges so it could lead to inaccurate numbers.If you really want accuracy though, you probably might want to do it manually by just averaging the ATH prices of exchanges that you deem legitimate enough. But yea, like what BitMaxz said mostly Preev should be enough.

### Original post:
Some of the headings we can read these past few hours on the media, bear phrases such as (translated when in Spanish):<link> list goes on, but the above headlines are enough to highlight a fact that is bound to be partially right (crypto being used to launder money), but that is blown out of proportion by most if not all the media, or at least, they do not bother to try to set the proportion.I managed to find the original report (see foot of this post), which Ive taken a brief look at. Some of the important contextual quotes I find to be the following (see Illicit financial flows and money- laundering mechanisms):I havent managed to see a laundering total per channel or method used, but cryptocurrencies are mentioned at the tail of the methods, in a context of emerging. Therefore, very likely, they represent a small (yet unquantified in the report) amount of the gross total.Press needs to stop searching for headings and learn to contextualize properly. By the above quotes from the base report, they should really have highlighted the association to banks, and not to crypto ...See:<link>

### Reply 1:
I was impressed how they know the value that is being laundered, bitcoin is something very volatile and needs some knowledge to avoid being stolen, not to mention that governments pressure exchanges, banks and so many companies to force their customers to do KYC then use bitcoin for money laundering is much riskier than using other methods, in my opinion because bitcoin is more flashy, fiat is something that has been used for years in the criminal world, but I could be wrong

### Reply 2:
This is the important part, as pointed by OP. The headline screams ""bitcoin money laundering"" and in reality they're using loopholes in the fiat system and traditional banking. If they are able to create shell accounts that regularly transfer relatively large sumps of money split into <$7500 transactions it's the bank's job to identify them. Then from the list of possible shell accounts the bank should be able to separate accounts with regular transfers to bitcoin exchanges and then trace the money back to the source. It's the bank's fault that shell accounts exist and that they are allowing people to open accounts using fake credentials. Somebody has to keep coming to the bank to deposit cash, because that's how dealers get paid and this cash is then converted to balance and transferred to bitcoin exchanges. Here you have your weak point and this is where the real laundering is happening, not when they pay somebody with Bitcoin. Suppliers pay mules in cash to smuggle drugs, then drugs are distributed by dealers who also get paid in cash and share profits with the cartel, the cartel deposits that cash in the bank, but all these deals and transfers are not important.

Topic: Saudi Aramco, worlds 3rd largest company, plans to start mining Bitcoin?
### Original post:
Investing.com reported that the Middle East oil giant, Saudi Aramco, is interested in mining bitcoin, citing information provided by Brazilian Bitcoin miner Ray Nasser in an interview on the Bitcoinheiros YouTube channel.Nasser reportedly said:It was explained in the report that Aramco could use the excess gas (by-product) generated by oil extraction in order to mine digital assets, which would provide extra security for Bitcoin while generating carbon credits for the company.Aramco has not yet issued any statement about venturing into Bitcoin mining.

### Reply 1:
This is not going to be an easy decision by the company, the report is that some miner proposed something to mine Bitcoin from the by products of the energy they produce but i is owned by the king of Saudi if i am right because all these high profile companies will be owned by the company and we have not heard about any positive news from them regarding Bitcoin and hence we can see this as a proposal. I have read about religious issues as a barrier to accept Bitcoin, some form of religious law in the religion prohibits them if i remember correctly.

### Reply 2:
I'm not sure about that. The latest information I have found is an article by Decrypt.According to decrypt, former Shariah Advisor to Blossom Finance, Mufti Muhammad Abu-Bakar said in his report, which was last updated in December 2019, argues that all currencies are speculative to some degree due to the nature of supply and demand; since fiat currencies, gold, and most other financial instruments are permissible under Sharia, so too should Bitcoin be.The full report can be found here:Shariah Analysis of Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, and BlockchainThe headline is obvious clickbait. I agree.

Topic: Does cryptocurrency mining produce more pollution?
### Original post:
Ever since cryptocurrency has existed people have started to mine it using their PCs or Miners GPUs. Considering that cryptocurrency mining consumes a lot of electricity because of it using a lot of processing power, does it really cause a large ecological impact on the world? Every time I see mining operations around the world, there are multiple miners in one place ranging from dozens to even hundreds in for those who can afford a lot of miners. That got me thinking that since there are a lot of GPUs running at once then it must use a lot of electricity which means that power plants, as a result, will need to generate more electricity which will lead to more pollution. Is the carbon footprint of these mining operations large enough to make a large impact on the world or it doesnt really cause a lot of pollution in the long run.What do you guys think and are there any greener solutions for mining cryptocurrencies?

### Reply 1:
It has been discussed a lot of times in this forum. Some mining farms use alternative energy since it is more cost-efficient and <truncated> Even paper money, digital cash, banks cause pollution, imagine the amount of plastic and papers and energy they consume to produce cards, money, coins, ATM, receipts and etc.

### Reply 2:
Indeed. Cryptocurrency mining is <truncated> because it doesn't produce gases that come from cars, factories, volcanoes and so on. The things that you only need in cryptocurrency mining is a lot of graphics card in a computer and an air-conditioned place to cool down your computer while mining, that is why there are no any chances for crypto mining to produce more pollution.

### Original post:
I am a member of a poor family. My parents work hard to sustain our household, But the family was not able to live properly with their income. Even my studies were canceled due to lack of money. Depending on my previous academic results my college teacher convinced my parents to enroll me in college. Later my teacher gifted me a smart phone. Then, my teacher explains to me about Bitcoin and how one can earn money from it. He tried to give me an idea about Bitcoin and assured me that if I know about Bitcoin and invest in it, I can earn good amount of money in the future which will remove my poverty. Since then, I make efforts to learn about Bitcoin. Besides, my teacher advice me about the Bitcointalk Forum where I can find extensive information about Bitcoin. He also mentions several other advantages. Intrigued by his words, I create an account on the Bitcointalk Forum website and try to gain knowledge about various important Bitcoin-related topics. Observing the discussions on the Bitcoin Forum, I become truly fascinated.I have learned to understand that any type of investment is risky but want to risk something that has the potential to change my financial situation.

One thing I was trying to understand is how the poor that basically operate a system of from hand to mouth for a means of survival would have a good enough amount to invest in bitcoin and hodl for a long term. Good enough youve devised a means and seems willing to go through the stress of not having yo enjoy your immediate earnings in hopes of better tomorrow. I do hope that works for you, stillI feel youre putting a whole lot of expectations on the innovation and I hope you understand that it takes a lot of time for this sort of expectation to come through.Welcome to the forum and hope you do well here.

### Reply 2:
A real teacher. Not only teachers but also the first person to open their eyes and direct you starting from introducing BTC and participating in this BTT forum. Yes. surely your teacher has been deep into this crypto world for a long time. especially BTC. That's right, what you wrote about the crypto world is very volatile, the market often changes faces. However, with basic knowledge and TA analysis it will be easy to read where the market is going. and it's true like you said Bitcoin is the road to Prosperity for Dreamers who are Determined and have a mentality.

Very well that you being a beginner did not fall into the hands of scammers. And decided to teach him a lesson. Of course, this is unlikely to help us get rid of them, but for fun it can be done.

### Reply 2:
I don't know which is worse. Believing that you can easily find and/or crack Bitcoin private keys, or believing in those scams that you send Bitcoin to some address, and then it listens onto ports to find the private key of people entering it over the network. You know those ones, where it shows a fake ""hacking screen"". Checked the addresses on blockchain and people actually STILL send BTC.

Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto or the author of the Bitcoin whitepaper, U.K. Judge James Mellor said after closing arguments in the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) trial on Thursday.The evidence presented during the month-long trial was ""overwhelming,"" the judge said, adding that he plans to write a ruling detailing his conclusions including that Wright did not create the Bitcoin system.""I will make certain declarations, which I am satisfied are useful and are necessary to do justice between the parties. First, that Dr. Wright is not the author of the Bitcoin white paper. Second, Dr. Wright is not the person who adopted or operated under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in the period 2008 to 2011. Third, Dr. Wright is not the person who created the Bitcoin System. And, fourth, he is not the author of the initial versions of the Bitcoin software.

Thank God this whole drama is finally coming to an end. I saw this news yesterday but it's surprising how one will just be too thick skinned to let go off his false claims even from the first time in 2016 when he spoke about it, I wonder what was is drive all these years since we know deep down he knows that in the end he will definitely lose the case

### Reply 2:
Praise Jesus! Thank you Judge Mellor and COPA for putting an end to this ridiculous farce that has been going on far too long once and for all. I hope Craig Wrong becomes bankrupted by this lawsuit and receives further future legal action against him including criminal charges for perjury and forging evidence which he richly deserves.

In my opinion he is the inexperience expert unluckiest trader i have seen ever in my life. If i know more word like this then it is must be suitable for him. Now i am going to introduced someone if you guys know about him you life will get a satisfaction if you take a late entry in bitcoin.A person name Nick Allen tweeted in 25/10/2011 that he got safe his money that he didn't buy bitcoin before thar date because that day bitcoin price down to $2.70.Can you imagine $2.70 and after 10 years today you guys know the price some days ago someone reply on him tweet that is Nick allen alive and Nick allen Replied he is alive but dead inside Can you imagine his feelings right now. I can imagine because i missed to buy eth at $9 price. And todays his that tweet screenshot is viral. Though after seeing that i visited his profile and saw he might be in stock market. But i couldn't find that tweet then i thought it might be edited. But i saw the same screenshot tweet from bitcoin account on twitter. And then Nick allen also reply on that tweet too. So after that i belived that tweet is real. But Nick allen delet that tweet. It might be possible or not. Now i want to know your opinion guys abou<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
I have put in bold what seems to me the most important of what you have said. I think the same. A lot of people didn't buy at $2, but then didn't buy at $20 because it seemed too expensive, and when it got to $200 the same thing. And at $2K and at $20K.I could have bought more in the past too, but I focus on the present. Bitcoin still has a lot of life left in it, and a lot to go up. Instead of regretting what I can no longer change, I focus on acting today on what I can change.

### Reply 2:
Correct solution, since it is missed, it cannot be changed. There are always people who say if they are given another chance, what will happen to them. I don't think we need to give us another chance. There are opportunities everywhere at the moment, so we don't have to worry about the facts.In 2011, I did not understand Bitcoin. I have only started to contact and enter the market in recent years. I missed a lot of valuable currencies, and many factors prevented me from holding them for a long time. But this will be the rich experience I will accumulate in the future, and there will be various valuable and promising currencies in the future.

Topic: Blocks packaged into zips for new Windows and Linux clients for convenience
### Original post:
Just as the subject says.A lot of new users (or those that want to run multiple computers with the client) have to wait until the client syncs up with the rest of network before any transactions can take place (or coin generating).So, for those technical people, I've packed up the bitcoin block into a zip file that has all of the blocks as of the time I created them just a few minutes ago. All this will do is save you some time on getting a fresh install of the client up to date with the rest of the network.This is meant only for new installs, wouldn't recommend dumping this on top of an existing install that you've been running for a while (as they were extracted from new blanks). While it's just simple to dump this zip files on top of the bitcoin data folder, it's still a bit technical so I wouldn't recommend this for non-technical people.This is merely for convenience and to help get new users up and running quicker. I'm sure the devs here probably already have something like this planned for the future, but until then I'm all for helping the community.The download link is in my signature below, so if this helps to save you or your friends time, consider donating a few coins to <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
I could, got plenty of servers (would only take one though) available to task for that, at least for the Linux clients. I'm sure I could dig up a windows server to do the same thing, just zip up the blocks upload them to the FTP every hour or so. Can't help the Mac people I'm afraid, all of my Mac are PPC, don't have an Intel based one anywhere to generate with, sorry Mac gurus

### Reply 2:
Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking too. Even on a 100 megabit fiber, no network is invincible to a ton of people wanting to all download at the same time.

Topic: Recent F2Pool dump
### Original post:
Interesting theory from financial daily City AM:In the case of why Bitcoin fell 23%, this can be put down to two primary reasons. F2Pool Bitcoin mining pool sent 3633 Bitcoin in a single transaction out of their bitcoin mining wallet and right onto the exchanges. They then proceeded to dump all of this bitcoin in a very short period of time. It is unknown if F2pool were also shorting Bitcoin to capitalise on the price falling. As the price of Bitcoin fell, there are so many new people in the market and new money is easily panicked so they then start selling for a loss and so you end up with huge amounts of Bitcoin flooding towards exchanges. This then snowballs into a catastrophic market move triggered by just one Bitcoin miner.The story of F2Pool dumping might not be one, however, of unsophisticated investors selling bitcoin to pay their bills. I believe it is more likely that F2Pool have been dumping Bitcoin in order to stop the price of Bitcoin going euphoric and ending the bullrun. Every time Bitcoin has turned euphoric on the NUPL (Net Unrealised Profit & Loss) indicator, a bear market has followed shortly after, so this is something to consider. The recent drop in Bitcoin pri<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
There is nothing interesting about finding a random medium size transaction on bitcoin blockchain and then making a guess about what that transaction was in order to make the conclusion that you like to make.The story here is full of holes.First of all there is no proof that the coins were moved to an exchange let alone were sold on that exchange. Secondly selling such a small amount on one exchange out of 12 major ones is not going to cause a bitcoin price crash. Worst thing it can do is to bring the price down on that one exchange and create an excellent arbitrage opportunity for traders to make a lot of money by buying cheap bitcoins on said exchange.Thirdly the drop we had recently is one of the most common types of drops that we see almost every month in bitcoin market! It is a part of bitcoin bull run.And finally here is 1,858 transactions that have a bigger output than 3633BTC that you mentioned ranging from 3633BTC to 116,010BTC and all took place between 31 Jan to 22 Feb which is during the time bitcoin price was rising. If anyone wants to make up random stories about that 3633BTC they have to make up the same stories about these 1858 transactions too!<link>

### Reply 2:
I guess that the guy who wrote the article, as the last dump was attributed to sales by F2pool, went looking for transactions in this recent dump to explain what had happened.

Topic: Bitcoin sidechains available today?
### Original post:
Bitcoin sidechains prove to be a great scalability solution that would lose the burden on the main Bitcoin blockchain. New cryptocurrencies can be created in a form of a sidechain, to obtain the security of Bitcoin without sacrificing scalability. This, combined with the Lightning Network, should make Bitcoin a powerful blockchain ecosystem that's capable of withstanding anything along the way. So far, I'm aware of a sidechain called ""Liquid"" provided by Blockstream which makes use of the main Bitcoin blockchain for security. But I'm on the look for more sidechains that are available on Bitcoin today. If this turns out to become successful, mainstream developers could simply choose to create a sidechain that would become resistant against 51% attacks. There are so many small altcoins out there that could mitigate the risks of external attacks by becoming a Bitcoin sidechain.Any recommendations, or suggestions will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

### Reply 1:
be prepared for some silencingits funny that the devs that made Liquid pretend its impossible to allow more than 2000tx to be confirmed in les than 10 minutes securely but meanwhile they are making other networks that can.i wonder whyoh yea coz they get the transaction fee's from itby the way liquid only does about 2tx a block on average and only plays with ~100tokens that are pretend btcand lastly. its a POS network with 15 entities of power. so its aint decentralisedso although claimed as a fast network with dozens of exchanges and private businesses using it.. and all the other propoganda.. its actually not really used.. kind of a shame devs invested soo much time for personal gain while crapping all over the real bitcoins utility issues and refusing to correct those issues.such a shame

### Reply 2:
actually scalability has been one of the biggest issues that bitcoin has always been facing and will continue to face forever. that is why dozens of developers have been working so hard for the past 5+ years to come up with different solutions to address this issue. from multiple raw block size change proposals (that include SegWit) to second layer solutions such as LN and everything in between.and by the way, scalability is not about being ""fast"" but it is about the ability to handle more transactions so that the system can handle the increased demand.

Topic: Virtual money is really the future of the world in the 4.0 era
### Original post:
Virtual money such as bitcoin is now in widespread use in many countries, but there is a good future for virtual money in the 4.0 era. It is not unbelievable about the power of virtual money, but in the age of 4.0 one needs a basis to make sure that bitcoin exists and grows, or just as a wind passes by and goes into oblivion . Have you ever thought about the basis of need and enough for bitcoin to grow?

### Reply 1:
I must say, some countries have passed beyond that embracing crypto. but yes, we need to do our part to keep crypto alive and grow more acceptance around the world so that we can speed up the process of the transformation (the whole world going crypto).

### Reply 2:
We are now in the world where we use half virtual half physical money in every transactions. As far as i observe, we use almost 60% virtual and 40% fiat which in the future, we can see that it will be evolving into pure virtual currency. Bitcoin and other crypto are growing and people are upgading things that will fit into it.

Topic: Do not store your wallet on the exchange, store it on your crypto wallet.
### Original post:
Some people stored their funds on a crypto exchange, which is not a good thing to do like a good bitcoin. Some people believe that their cryptocurrency is much safer in exchange than their crypto wallet, this concept is a big no for me, well, in fact, I always read some articles about a hacked exchange every week or months. It is much safer to store our money in our crypto wallet but the problem with it is that it is also vulnerable to being stolen by hackers.We can prevent this thing from storing our private and public keys.Just key terms to <truncated> of fundsPublic key - allows you to transfer funds into itPrivate key - allows you to transfer funds out to it. ExclusivelyPublic key - publicly known and important for <truncated> key - this should be secret, excluded only for two parties which are the receiver and the sender.If you lose your public key, you can still access it using your private key and if you lose your private key you cannot access your fund anymore. Storing your private key is a really important thing to do whenever you want to secure your wallet. Do not store it on your device because any device ate prone to hackers. Use any strategies except online.

### Reply 1:
Another example incident that just happened recently.<link> sure those people who had stored some coins on OKEX had a sweating balls at the moment.Its never been good to make exchange wallet as your primary or storage ones.

### Reply 2:
Thanks for giving me good advice. But a trader, especially a daily trader, they will keep their assets in the exchange wallet for trading and the profits will be sent to the personal wallet. Very inconvenient if every day you have to make deposits and withdrawals. After all, losing crypto assets is a risk that must be borne by the holder, because hackers always have a way to commit crimes.

Topic: A Sovereign Bitcoiner's Manifesto
### Original post:
More than mildly, it annoys us that we have the tools to be truly sovereign and yet we continue to submit our ourselves, and our bitcoin, to centralised authorities. ""Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age""; yet KYC is demanded before we can trade.""Not your keys, not your coins""; yet millions of bitcoin sit in the vaults of custodial exchanges and wallets. For monetary liberty to be widespread it must be part of the social contract. We must come together to deploy decentralised systems that maintain Bitcoin's promise of sovereignty. These tools already exist and they are improving.

### Reply 1:
Couldn't agree with this more and it's exciting to see this start playing out. Bitcoin is the first real application of decentralized finance, and today we have the tools to build on top of that and provide services that are immutable, uncensorable and that draw on the hardest money to ever exist..This is the right attitude. I have a feeling that many of the successful Defi apps on Ethereum will soon be migrating to other chains, and Bitcoin is a natural choice and probably the only choice, since its sound money attributes will keep on sucking in all the liquidity.

### Reply 2:
To me it seems that there is a segment of the Bitcoin community that are actually fearful of Ethereum. They try to protect against this by making it their mission to FUD everything that has the mere whiff of Ethereum. An unfortunate side effect of this is an inability to acknowledge any benefits that might come from smart contracts - which is ironic, since one of the true Bitcoin OGs , Nick Szabo basically invented the smart contract concept. To my mind, Bitcoin has nothing to fear from Ethereum... any more than Bitcoin has anything to fear from any of its other testnets. The only thing we have to fear is the mental stagnation that comes with throwing the baby out with the bath water. I am not willing to concede smart contracts to Ethereum. We invented them, they are ours.

Topic: Can BTC become the world central currency?
### Original post:
At a time when the world is clamouring for peace and unity among the countries of the world- developed and developing.There is a major limitation, which is the different currencies of the countries. These fiat currencies are controlled by different policies and economic situations of their different countries. This posses a threat to global financial unity. As many countries are under banked. At the height of these challenges, came a pseudo human called Satoshi, who created what seems like 21st century wonders(bitcoin) From 2009 till date, bitcoin suffered too many set back, ranging from disbelief to doubt about its future. But 10 years down the tunnel is a great improvement and acceptance of the first cryptocurrency - bitcoin.The huge acceptance lead to the creation of several altcoins. Now many countries are willing to involve in the cryptocurrency world despite some restrictions in some countries because according to an African adage ""No one knows the Goose that will lay the golden egg"".I am seeing in the future where BTC will become a unified currency for the whole world.

### Reply 1:
Hopefully not, because BTC is not centralized and I hope it will always remain this way. This should always remain the people's coin (not that dumb Dogecoin as genius clown Musk says to his sheep).

### Reply 2:
BTC is so volatile because of low dept of market, high percentage of inexperienced traders, low amount of big market makers. With every step BTC makes this numbers change. Its not like BTC will become a world reserve currency staying at 50k price with current price behaviour... I doubt it will happened but if it will happened BTC will pump to like 50 mln $ and volume will pump from 40B$ to few trillions and huge market makers will bring liquidity that will reduce volatility.

Topic: HODL vs Staking, What is the best strategy?
### Original post:
Do you guys ever hear about holding bitcoin in staking platform?If yes, can you give any advice to stake bitcoin on staking platform?I've been asking for many times about it, but I need proof experience of you. Please share below!

### Reply 1:
There is no staking for Bitcoin, and using any centralized services like bitgo is custodial service that can earn small interest but you are giving away ownership of your coins, you need to trust some third party service to keep your coins safe, then you need to pass some kyc verification, send your documentation and gave up your privacy after you link your address with your identity.Holding is much less risky and history showed that it pays off if you do it correctly with some cold storage or hardware wallet.

### Reply 2:
Just like what dkbit98 mentioned, OP probably meant parking Bitcoin in some interest/ custodial account or the exchange versus the traditional cold wallet.For the interest part, try to avoid exchange as they are a prime target compared to other custodial wallets which are at least insured and less likely to be attacked.Just remember that either are not foolproof (exclude the cold wallet).

Topic: Bitcoin FreeFloat Supply
### Original post:
Bitcoin circulating supply shown in Coingecko and CoinMarketCap websites is around 18.62 millions but we know that many Bitcoins are missing and lost forever so blockchain analytics firm Coinmetrics created FreeFloat Supply for Bitcoin to create more realistic supply.With their methodology calculations it is showing much lower supply with around 14 million Bitcoins, and they believe almost 4 million is gone, and It's not like I am surprised with this but I would like to see how exactly did they calculate this but they don't provide any explanation about this, but they probably excluded all coins that was not moved in several years.As a result from this they also claim that Bitcoin market cap is much lower than shown on other websites, Coingecko claims around $707 Billions, and Coinmarketcap around $705 Billions in time of writting this post.I would not call this website and numbers they show precise or reliable and I know some people are holding and not moving their Bitcoin for years, but it is still nice attempt from them to show more realistic supply image, and that also means that Bitcoin is more valuable.<link>

### Reply 1:
You can't confirm and make difference with coins that are missing from coins that are just hibernating, so it is still just a speculation and some percentage of coins can get active at some point of time.I still think millions of coins are gone forever, but I am not sure if 4 million is correct number.

### Reply 2:
14 million bitcoins? probably the number of bitcoins that haven't been lost? If that's how they determine it, I wonder how they are able to determined the true number of lost coin and how reliable is the method for determining this. They are probably watching old coins that haven't been moved nor have experienced any kind of activity from their holders since they were owned/stored.

Topic: Can Bitcoin Crash?
### Original post:
Bitcoin has been around for quite some time, since 2009 to be exact - but it is only over the past few years that it has garnered the attention it deserves.The media and critics are always quick to jump on any movement Bitcoin occurs, but can Bitcoin actually crash?Take a look at this article, its summed up quite nicely: <link>

### Reply 1:
Given the support for investment giants like Grayscale, for example, this is not an option. BTC has a very serious interest from around the world.

### Reply 2:
It's not possible Bitcoin will crash into zero, zero means no demand on Bitcoin. I believe there's some people still interested with Bitcoin and buy it for fun only.For @OP Bitcoin can crash anytime if something like serious/critical attack occur, but it's hard to think which attack will happen in the future. I've read the article you said Bitcoin can't crash, I think you were wrong because Bitcoin is high risk and the market can be manipulated by whales. If Bitcoin can't crash, why on 2018 Bitcoin suddenly dropped from $19,000 to $3,500?

Topic: Automated arbitration agents
### Original post:
Hi,I was discussing gambling and Bitcoin with a colleague, and it occurred to us there's a need for computerized arbitration. What I mean is, currently, to place a bet, you have to either just trust whoever you're betting against, or use a third party as escrow. Obviously this is a problem for people other than gamblers as well.What if you could have a truly neutral third party? A non-human one?I'll try to outline what I had in mind. I'm not that IT-savvy, so there are glaring errors in this idea. Which is why I'm posting here.The program is written. The source is released into the wild, and anyone can compile it[1]. On compilation, the program creates a set of encryption keys not known to any person. [2] It is then run, and provided CPU time and possibly seeded with some funds to let it purchase more elsewhere. A protocol would be needed to let the program negotiate for CPU cycles among different servers. The program propagates and distributes its functions redundantly among these servers.[3] Redundancy implies the program does not trust any single server operator, and will perform any computation performed on one server on several others in order to guard against tampering.

Why do such transactions need to be manually entered by a miner? You have up to TX_WEIGHT = 400000 which enables you to set up a transaction up to that size and then keep broadcasting the transactions until you have one input of 15 BTC.I do not know the amount of fees you will pay, but it will definitely not reach 1 Bitcoin. Assuming it does, a miner will not be able to send them all in one transaction, and then the same process will follow.The choice to admit that these coins are not yours will not change the reality of what can be done in mempool.<link>

Topic: Bitcoin is irreversible: strength and weakness
### Original post:
One of the most important feature of cryptocurrency is its being irreversible. One the coin is sent, the only way for it to be back to the sender is if the receiver will do the same thing in reverse. Now, in cases of hacks, scams and frauds, it means that you better forget what you already lost as there is no way for you to recover the lost coins. In other words, once you click the send button there is no turning back. I know that a lot of us are actually considering this a major advantage of Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency for that matter because unlike PayPal there can be no refund requests to happen. Therefore when you are a victim of a theft, expect no one to be able to help you in recovering the coins. As one author said it, the bitcoin genie cannot be put back into the blockchain bottle.I am wondering, can we not devise an effective and special technology that can be utilize in case of hacks or frauds? Given the advances of cryptocurrency and the blockchain we are experiencing right now, is it even possible?

### Reply 1:
It should always be irreversible and by no means a done deal once the sent button is done. However one can still divert the said transaction if it isn't confirmed yet, so the mistake can somehow be corrected within a few minutes, so people should be keen on the details of their transactions. As for thefts and fraud, I can say that the irreversible nature of tx somewhat pushes people to better their security and the way they keep funds. It's a double-edged sword, but certainly a good thing since it urges people to take extra caution in handling their money in order to prevent hacks and thefts.

### Reply 2:
When we talk about bitcoin as a means of payment then in most cases is possible to prevent abuse. In case you buy something in this forum and you use escrow, transaction is safe almost as if you were using PayPal. Since most merchants accept bitcoin using payment processors, they should also in some way protect users, so in a way there is some kind of protection.In case coins are hacked from user desktop / mobile wallet, only way to get them back is to find hacker and take that coins from him, but this is in most cases impossible. Some method that would make it possible to just move coins from one address to another without private key would be subject to abuse, and would totally undermine concept of bitcoin. The rule is that who controls the private key of some address, controls coins on that address regardless of whether it is a legitimate user or hacker.

Topic: Broadcasting the Blockchain
### Original post:
The Bitcoin blockchain can be kept up-to-date with less than a 2400 baud connection. This is within the limits of amateur packet radio technology. Using standard HAM radio transmitters and cheap SDR receivers, this can enable an unlimited number of clients to perform transaction verification and mining, possibly in remote locations, without requiring a dedicated internet connection. A separate uplink, such as a phone line or perhaps two-way pager, can be used intermittently to initiate transactions or to transmit mined blocks.What do you think? Could this concept be economical in developing countries, or in areas with high internet costs? Could it perhaps one day enable miners to reclaim stranded renewable energy during periods of overproduction? Could it even justify dedicated satellite or unmanned aerial transmitters? Or is this concept simply wildly-unrealistic, pie-in-the-sky speculation?

Do people really have mining gear and reliable electricity in places that this would help? And won't a phone call when they need to check on or make a payment be all they need if not mining?

### Reply 2:
Interesting. I like your idea about a channel on digital satellite radio. I wonder if those $11 SDR receivers would be capable of decoding this.Part of my original thought was that there are places where electricity is basically free at least part of the time. But you're right, the idea isn't very useful if not mining.

Topic: Bitcoin vs CBDC - Spread the Word
### Original post:
Governments and countries around the world are working hard to implement CBDC as fast as they can and they are getting serious about it.I won't name all individual examples but I will post one website who is keeping track of all worldwide news and status for most countries.There is currently WEF forum in Davos and they are advertising CBDC currencies that are going to be protected by Interpol, and in same time they announce catastrophic cyber attack, removal of cash payments, and concern about Bitcoin One website for tracking CBDC projects is called Cbdctracker and it is showing world map of countries with more information:<link> more CBDC tracker posted by tbct_mt2:<link> can you do about this?You can write your local politicians, complain, call them, visit them and demand from them to stop working on CBDC crap.I also found interesting project called @NoCBDC that created cool stickers that are pro Bitcoin and anti-CBDC in the same time.You can print out this stickers, share them in your local areas, send them to friends and spread the word while we have time, or you will wake up in nightmare scenario one day.Bitcoin vs CBDC - What should digital money look like?<link> or make your<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Do you really think this would be effective? The desire of governments to control our lives is obvious in many countries and anyone who is yet to come to that realization would not do so cause of some sticker.We cannot boo away CBDCs or sign petitions against it, we can only avoid it and stick to decentralized medium of exchange on the blockchain. And hope others would follow suit.- Jay -

### Reply 2:
Maybe this approach can work in civilized countries, but not on the generalized corrupt ones, that is the case where I live and as I see, CBDC is already in Proof of Concept stage here. Politicians rely on the ignorance of the citizens to pass laws they want which will favour them and their groups on long run, without any kind of uprisings from the people. The conscious minority who protests is just going to be ignored by politicians, since they don't really their votes to be elected. If the three powers (executive, legislative and judiciary) want to approve CBDC, they are going to do this here without any setbacks.I hope in your countries you have more luck fighting it back.

Topic: Lost Bitcoin?
### Original post:
If we want crypto currency to be a currency we have to keep spending right? But at the same time it's something worth keeping too since I do the same with my fiat in bank for more than 2years without touching it. Is it possible to say that Bitcoin in every wallets for the past 2years without moving are considered lost due to death or lost recovery keys? It's pretty hard to believe that anyone won't come back for their Bitcoin after 2years with no activities on the wallet.

### Reply 1:
A wallet without any transaction for 2 year is considered as the owner is death or lost seeds? no way, there are many people are holding Bitcoin for more than 2 years without moving it because they're trying for long term holding. Bitcoin is still 13 years old which is same like a child enter junior high school, I would say Bitcoin is really lost when the age of Bitcoin is exceed the average person lifespan, around 60-80 years old. It's just my assumption though, there's still a little chance those Bitcoin will be moved because we don't know what the next technology or the previous owner hide their seeds.

### Reply 2:
If for two years fiat is kept in the bank, they keep rotating our money and it looks like it will be profitable because of interest when it is just a wind of heaven sold by them to get customers. If we keep a large amount of fiat, then one day when we need it and want to withdraw it, the bank will make excuses by telling us to come back in the next few days. That's my experience.Not to mention the decline in value.It's different from keeping Bitcoin in a wallet for years. Whenever the owner needs it, then we can use it. If Bitcoin was stored for 1 year ago, maybe the benefits we can get have made us a rich man, especially those who store in a wallet before Bitcoin has the current price.Not lost, but don't want to use it. Maybe this is the same as what was said above.

Topic: Ron Paul advises people to be careful regarding bitcoins
### Original post:
According to Ron Paul , the government might be collecting information about people and what are they doing with their money in bitcoins and where the taxes are headed to therefore he said it's better to be 'viligant' of the government. - I do believe the time when KYC and documentation was made essential for any existing wallets or any bitcoin related site , this was something that we already did predict. The libertarian stated how the most important thing is to make * bitcoins legal * he apparently drafted a bill regarding that too and what's even more important is ** to make sure it stays legal **. He continued saying how the government made it illegal to hold gold up until 1975.The guy believed that it's very important that people are allowed to make their own financial decisions and they can very well do that using cryptocurrencies like: Bitcoins. <link> Let's share our thoughts on this matter.Is there something new that we don't know but they guy does ? Is the government thinking about making it illegal ? Are they using cryptocurrencies to track people?? A lot of questions about this !?

### Reply 1:
I think this will only cause concern for traders in countries with a large taxation of profits from the crypto market. In my country, the government has not proposed laws that ban Crypto or impose high taxes on trading in the Crypto market. So I don't have to worry too much and can trade normally even while I'm being watched.But nevertheless, we should not evade taxes or try to bypass the government, we are always monitored and only the observance of the rule will keep us safe.

### Reply 2:
Privacy and anonymity are most fundamental and important things for bitcoiners. In non custodial wallets, you have control on your address and transactions. Use the change addresses for your transactions and if possible try to use VPS (not trial or free accounts) to get as best privacy and anonymity as possible.About tax, in nations that tax is strictly regulated, it is good for future if you pay tax in full from your profits. If you try to hide your huge income from bitcoin exchange, governments might put you into jails anytime.

Topic: What if 1 satoshi worth more than 1 dollar?

Hi,As we know Bitcoin was made for cash payments in the world. Its system is designed and updated to perform over hundred years. Thus, one day with dollar inflation (if it still exists) and bitcoin desinflation, 1 satoshi or 0,00000001 BTC would has 1 dollar price or more. So, how to buy a item that cost less than the 1 satoshi price, considering that it is the smallest division (the BTC atom) of the bitcoin?The way I see it today, this problem could have two solutions:1. An upgrade making BTC having more divisible units. I think this is difficult because the bitcoin community has to change the original design of the project. And Satoshi Nakamoto must had thought that this day would come, was itentional the ideia that 1 satoshi could value the price of a expensive itens without the option of a pay back? We have to think that the purpose on the subject of bitcoins whitepapper mention the words cash payments, so bitcoin was design to it.Or2.

Precise. Thank you!

1 satoshi equals to $1, when will it happen?In either two scenariosWhen Bitcoin has very good growth by massive adoption and attract massive new capital flows into Bitcoin market.When fiat currencies have massive hyper inflation like another pandemic, world war whatever which forces government to print more fiat currencies globally.We know governments and central banks don't stop their inflationary works so it is not Bitcoin responsibility to have a smaller denomination when 1 satoshi = $1.Governments create inflation and they create new nominations for their fiat currencies like from 100 to 1,000 10,000 100,000 500,000 and maybe in future 1,000,000 currency note.[Did you know?] Bitcoin Table of UnitsBitcoin unit converter

Not necessarily. P2SH will work without a fork pretty soon.Obviously PoS is a huge change, much larger than P2SH, but it could be implemented within the system if people are convinced it's the best for everyone involved.Remember, the danger this tries to prevent is many years in the future ... it's not urgent to do it now. Building the consensus can even take a few years.Rather than a fork, it could just be a fresh alt chain ... let the market forces decide if Bitcoin+PoS is better than Bitcoin. I prefer to see the evolution of core Bitcoin instead of a zillion different alt chains that fail to gain market share. If a new alt chain came out with Proof of Stake right now, I wouldn't buy it, because I think it's premature.

No offense, but this is a pretty silly hack to fix the problem. Make it more centralized and concentrate even more power to the bitrich?<link> I describe the early musings of a ""heuristic"" approach, although tied to an idea for a stable currency. Revalin brought up a good point that the bitcoin days destroyed concept would fit well. Essentially coins that have not been used recently will have a greater weight in which chain will prevail. There then needs to be a timer such as an hour ahead of each block where it may be replaced and anything ahead of it would be removed. Some balance between length of time to replace and block weight would have to be done so that a block with one more transaction can't come along 50 minutes later and replace a block from 50 minutes ago and such. But it allows for much less mining power necessary to secure the network. Theoretically, none at all is really required although that would certainly make for a lot of collisions. Instead of # of confirmations, time would simply be the indicator for how secure a historic transaction is.But using bitcoin days destroyed, any potential attack would only be able to be carried out if the person had a lot of old c<rest of post truncated>

Topic: Nearly 3 years on a LN does not seem to be adopted sufficiently to prevent mempo
### Original post:
The mempool is over 90mb and climbing again ? If this is a slow and steady bull the amount of unconfirmed tx will rise to over 200k or more again?How near to the 300mb limit has it come before?Is this because LN network is not mitigating this issue as was hoped? Someone else mentioned the current issue is compounded by a short term drop in hashing?I know the price movement always causes some short term clogging upWhat other solutions in the works are there?

### Reply 1:
Lightning can only be used when the service you are trying to send coins to or withdraw coins from supports Lightning. When there are big surges in the price like this, then vast majority of additional transactions above the usual number of transactions are to and from centralized exchanges. I am not aware of a single major centralized exchange which supports Lightning yet. Given that it took them some of them years to simply implement a new address type, I suspect we will be waiting several more years before they finally start accepting Lightning. They are almost comically bad at keeping up to date with technological advances, but since people continue to send them their money and support their clogging of the mempool, then they will continue to get away with it.Yes. The hash rate peaked at around 144 EH/s just before the last difficulty readjustment, and has now fallen to 130 EH/s, taking around 10% off the hash rate. If the hash rate had stayed static at 144 EH/s and we were mining blocks on a 10 minute average, then we would be about 200 blocks further along than we are now, which would be more than enough space to completely empty the mempool, which is currently around 76 MB.

### Reply 2:
Let's hope so, because it's times like these that I wish businesses accepted altcoins, like Dash, doge, or pretty much any other coin that doesn't take 24 hours+ to get 1 confirmation. I've got two outgoing bitcoin transactions right now that I sent yesterday morning, and I'm still waiting and waiting.I love bitcoin, but this is why it's an awful currency in its current state. And I realize this is just a temporary backup, but one of the transactions of mine from yesterday was kind of important to get confirmed quickly.

Topic: Total bitcoins limit
### Original post:
Is total bitcoins limit is a software limitation, or there are mathematical barriers to make this limit bigger?

### Reply 1:
if I'm not mistaken there would only be a total of 21M bitcoin to be generated via hash or the miners. Not sure what would happen to the value by then.

### Reply 2:
The max supply is realized by a process called 'Halving' it simply does what it says it halves the reward for mining a block. At the very beginning this reward was an amount of 50 BTC, after 210.000 blocks were mined this reward halved to 25 BTC. It happens every 210,000 blocks, which is equal to about 4 years when you assume that blocks are mined every 10 minutes. The current block reward is 12,5 BTC, approximate mid June 2020 the reward will halve again to 6,25 BTC. More information including a countdown timer can be found on <link> .

The identity of the creator of Bitcoin has been a topic of contention since the Bitcoin creator went inactive for several years now, traders and speculators are now guessing who is behind the latest activities on the Satoshi bitcoin Era wallet.

### Reply 1:
Mister Craig W supposedly said the latest court ruling means or proves he is indeed Satoshi. So if you really believe he is back then go and worship CW.Meanwhile the true wallet that everyone needs to be signed to prove he/she is the owner of it has never touched or budged.There is no obsession from the majority of Bitcoiners about Satoshi. Stop feeding it.

### Reply 2:
We never know how much bitcoin that the creator has, that 321 btc balance could be only one of his many wallets just like the people who has high amount of bitcoin, they must be seperate it into multiple wallets.Also we can not confirm the owner of the wallet is really satoshi who created bitcoin, i think it's better to keep it as a mystery and never revealed because that's the unique thing about cryptocurrency, we never know who is the real creator and what the creator doing with it right now.

For the first time since 2022 I have officially put an end to Bitcoin payments on my business until further notice, I have gave few people some discount advantages to spread news about Bitcoin and now I am not so sure anymore, I can't even afford $5 per Bitcoin transaction, and also my customers that are surety when it comes to Bitcoin payment have all halt. Ordinals looks like it's here to stay, I don't believe that Ordinals is like ICO because they are different. And Ordinals came in a bear market, imagine what this will do to Bitcoin in a bull market.Is there any business owners accepting Bitcoin still? How are you doing it? Is there any way to go around this? I will appreciate, because I don't want to stop accepting Bitcoin, I have my long term plan and accepting Bitcoin as payment have helped so far.

### Reply 1:
If you noticed it that currently as we speak, things have bee getting better with bitcoin transaction fees, yet the Ordinals still exist, i believe there's much ongoing through the decision on this experience and very soon we will understand where it's all heading to.If course people do, transaction fee shouldn't be a barrier if you're buying something worth thousands of USD in bitcoin and just paying not more than $20 to $50 USD in bitcoin as charges, whereas things have gone down now unlike before.Make your transaction using wallet like electrum, put the function on static when making payments, pump the transaction fee using the RBF features, also make weekend payment abd study when the mempool is not congested.

IMO, as long as Bitcoin is not your only means of payment in your business, then there is nothing wrong with taking a pause at the moment that the fee is so high. By the way, I do accept Bitcoin payment in my business, and during this period, I have also encountered the challenge of a high fee, which I had to share 50/50 between myself and the customer. At least I have a business where if I sell one piece of my furniture, it always has a lot of profit, so I still feel not much cheated by the fee, but just that it's abnormal to me since I have not experienced such a situation before and also the fact that I still started accepting Bitcoin payments last year and having to see this situation taking place now. I believe it will be handled, though it might take some time to normalize. My advice to you is that if you feel you are spending so much having to cover fees for customers and also that they are not willing to cover the transaction fee themselves, you can yet take a pause, and when the fee is normal, you can start accepting again.From what tranthidung said, I think you should create those thread and announce it there.

Topic: Impact of Bitcoin growing Dominance on the Crypto space
### Original post:
Bitcoin being the pioneer cryptocurrency has always had a big gulf between it and other cryptocurrencies in the market mostly in term of valuation. Although this is expected, the growing dominance BTC is having on the entire crypto market does not speak good for the crypto space...As at the time of this publication, btc dominance in the crypto market account for 68.4 percent, with this being the highest since April 2017. The question is what does this growth in dominance imply?those it suggest an immiment pump? since the bull run started not long after such high dominance was recorded or those it imply further dump for altcoins and increase it btc valuation...Please share your opinions.

### Reply 1:
bitcoin dominance is not growing. it has always been high and above 95%what is growing is the ratio that bitcoin's market cap has compared to the sum of 3000+ altcoins and tokens market capitalization. and there simply are two reasons for it: death of about 1000 of those altcoins and hard dump of the rest.the only impact this has is that it wakes up a lot of newbies who thought just because an altcoin has a huge market capitalization it must be a good investment. but the 90% loss over a year is making them face the reality now.

### Reply 2:
Well, a few years ago there were only a hand full of Alt coins out there and then there was Bitcoin. People were not spoiled for choice, when it came to Alt coins, so these Alt coins did very well back then. We think about coins like Dogecoin and LiteCoin and NameCoin etc..Now, people are spoiled for choice with over 4,000 altcoins (alternative variants of bitcoin, or other cryptocurrencies) that have been created since 2009. So you have 1000's of Alt coins having to compete for a limited amount of the total market share of investors that are willing to invest in Crypto currencies.

ahh ok, well understood so farand the seed always creates the same private key and the private key always creates the same public key when restoring the wallet?So just like the seed always stays the same, do the private and public keys stay the same?

Topic: Take bitcoin as the virtual currency, that perform better than physical currency
### Original post:
Since 2009 when Bitcoin was launched by satoshi, Bitcoin has performed better than most physical currencies. Why I create this thread is to define the role of decentralized digital currency like Bitcoin as an alternative currency in the economy, and to dispute the claim by some Bitcoin haters that discard Bitcoin as a none physical represented currency and only exists on the Internet.But Bitcoin has out performed most physical currencies such as the dollars and the rest of other centralized currencies. Due to the decentralized nature of Bitcoin it allow bitcoin to be use anywhere and at any time without any restrictions. Bitcoin perform the role that other currencies can not serve any purpose, take for example if you leave and saved your money in your local bank currencies and it happens that you traveled to another country you may have problem with apending your money and tou bank savings may become useless and the only option will be Bitcoin as the only alternative.Note: this explanation was born out of my own personal experience, and i hope others here will share similar experience too!

### Reply 1:
The problem is Bitcoin price keeps growing overtime due to its deflationary supply feature. Bitcoin can be categorized in different type based on user perspective. It's very hard to use a currency that has an unstable value to replacedthe current currency we are using right now. For me Bitcoin is best to categorized as an asset and not pure currency since its value is increasing like Gold over time but Bitcoin has an advantage since its supply is limited while Gold, Fiat and other precious metal has an unlimited supply.

### Reply 2:
Let consider bitcoin impact within it first thirteen years to other currencies, take a look at it market capitalization as well, i got an article some times back that also talks about the most googled word on the internet is bitcoin and in no doubt it has been the only branded name across the universe that everyone soughted after, why is because it offers something new than we've been experiencing right from time with the management and handling of finances from being centralized

Topic: Something you need know about lighting network
### Original post:
There are wallets that are custodial which people can use for lightning network. Everything the person needs is to download the wallet do the backup and generate an invoice to receive payment.I have read before that not your node not your coin. There are ways you can be able to run your own lightning node to use lightning payment. Connecting to other nodes and allow people to open channels with you. This will help you in having privacy. On Electrum wallet, you do not need to have your own node but open a channel directly. It is not custodial lightning that you will just download a wallet, do backup and generate invoice. You have to open a channel. The channels that depend on lightning nodes just like light client wallets depend on full nodes.

Topic: Where are the Bitcoin PTCs, PPM, PPC and RevAdShare Sites gone?
### Original post:
For your info, PTC - Paid to clicksPPM - Paid per 1000 impressionsPPC - Paid per clicksRevAdShare - Revenue Ad sharing websitesAll these types of sites were available before when BTC used to be under $1000, where have they gone now? Do you guys know about the current state on their existence as of now?

### Reply 1:
They're mostly still around, it's just that every time the bitcoin price multiplies, for example from $1000 to $9000 now, these sites can't replenish their funds while feasibly paying everyone at the same rate they used to give, because it's like all the users of these services suddenly need several times the amount of money they used to get, as the result of the bitcoin price increase. At that point they have two options, lower the payout rates drastically or shut down operations.I imagine there would be an outage among customers if they get much lower payouts than they used to so most of the times, the revenue ad sharing sites just shut down.Offerwalls are just PTCs that pay you to complete surveys and install apps instead of clicking on links, so they are subject to the same process I described above.

### Reply 2:
I think they're still around though not to the same degree as they were before. With the value of bitcoin skyrocketing, it would honestly be a good lure to the newbies to join such websites in order to make a quick profit. It was replaced mostly by ad-watching and installing apps for a certain time period before you get paid. Kinda like mturks back in the day. Not gonna lie, I tried completing those quests/offers and try to reach the bare minimum to withdraw but it's just not attainable given the limited number of tasks these sites issue per day.

Topic: Buying houses with BTC
### Original post:
I have recently watched a video where the guy says that it is safer to buy a house with BTC (and other cryptocurrencies) than buying through one real estate agent. If I remember correctly, he says that it can be proven through a NFT.That sounds cool, but what about all the regulations and laws of the government? I mean, won't they charge their share? Won't it be possible to get a fine for using crypto instead of FIAT?I know there are already countries that are ""crypto-friendly"", but it seems to be interesting to prove your house purchase through an NFT.

### Reply 1:
Probably when you have whatever that you want to sell you can place your option of buyer, it might be through a Fiat, cryptocurrency especially Bitcoin because in this present time many people do embrace Bitcoin and the normally fix their option of whatever thing they want to sell to Bitcoin, so therefore 1 bitcoin can get you a house if the person wanted in Bitcoin even though you convert it in usdt it will still give you the same value according to the country's rate of their currency so that is why in some countries one BTC cannot afford to get ours depending the position or the location of the environment why in some other countries one BTC will get you a huge house even get you a car depending the environment or the location of the building so in summary it depends the location and the country based on on their currency denomination

### Reply 2:
Unfortunately either you (or the video maker) confuse the terms here. NFTs have nothing to do with regular bitcoin transactions. It's possible to buy a house and make the transaction on blockchain, then receive the house as a newly minted NFT on Ethereum for example, but it makes no sense from legal standpoint, as noone in the world recognizes NFTs as something that institutes property rights.

<link> Whatever the man did , we all know , to sum up now his lawyers tried to prove that he is Autistic and thus trail shouldn't be harsh and all . Now the judge is seriously pissed off and he apparently is not gonna leave the man , even though he did accept the Autism defense , sanctions were kicked out of the picture.This came out to be a little funny , Autistic? Is he mocking the community? Autism is no joke , I have seen people struggling day and night to do a simple task in regards to that , you don't have Autism if it suddenly appeared after death of your best friend when you are in your 40's. Isn't this too convincing? Right after we got to know that the man really did confess his crimes , when he was gonna go into trial he suddenly took the low road. Why was there no mention of it before ? A quote on 17 April, 2020: He is now claiming to be Autistic .. The symptoms usually Begin at the age of 2 or before that , therefore I do think he would have had some support and proof regarding the same.<link> This is him speaking in the conference of 2019 of coingeek , whereas am not able to identify any social problems , I do think he would soon come up with an explanation regarding <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
From this court case and his general disposition, we can see that CSW is a logical and highly intelligent person and unfortunately I believe hes got a Master Plan that no of us are aware of. Whether hes shows autistic traits or pathological liar traits is debatable, but what Im sure of is this case will go on and on and somehow it will play into his hands. He is always 2 steps ahead of everyone - whether we like it or not unfortunately.

### Reply 2:
Well, it seems he cannot fool the judge so easily. I have friends with sons and daughters with autism and it is no joke.They are trying their best to be a good parent even with a difficult situation. If he is proved to be lying with this sickness that he is claiming, we will see more lawsuit filed against him especially the organizations who are protecting people with the said sickness. He might as well claim it until the end or else it will be a bad road for him in jail.

### Reply 1:
Yep! I've seen so many community alert posts on social media, indicating the compromise of the Ledger's ConnectKit Library with Revoke. Cash. I've personally taken some actions and disconnected all of my active connections with most of Dapps. Playing safe in such circumstances is good for funds.I'm not sure why are you creating this thread so late and TBH I've not scrolled any other section yet, maybe there are some of early threads already covering this topic.

### Reply 2:
It's only if you install new software. I don't update to newest versions right away because I've learned over the years that updates often are unstable and you have to install fixes later. It's better to wait for a while. Also, they're fixing this, so if you still using ledger, wait a few days until it calms down and move it to something better. Their updates that allowed them to access your wallet were the first warning for users that this company is not the best choice. Now there's this little problem. Let's see how many people lose their savings because of this bug.

Topic: Bitcoin thief who stole $5M worth of crypto sentenced to 4 years in prison
### Original post:
Source 1Source 2This is the latest sentencing of a Bitcoin thief coming from the US. After he successfully recreated the wallet containing his brother's Bitcoin proceeds from Helix and laundered it through two online mixers service, I believe he wouldn't have been caught If not for his lifestyle and expensive property purchases that attracted the attention of government agencies.

### Reply 1:
If you are going to do something like this you really can't go out and start spending all that money and showing off.Go out to nicer restaurants, fine. Drop $25000 in a club, not fine.Get the fully loaded Honda Accord instead of a low end one, fine. Get a 7 series BMW, not fine.Take a vacation and fly business class instead of coach and stay in a slightly nicer hotel fine. Charter a jet and rent a private villa for 3 weeks, not fine.And so on. It's not like he was not being watched because of his brother.You can't fix stupid....-Dave

### Reply 2:
Kind of seems that way to me since other cryptocurrencies were also found in the hardware. The fact that the Bitcoin constitutes highest amount of his brother's proceeds is not enough reason for him to be tag a Bitcoin thief.IRS had the hardware wallet in their possession but they couldn't access the cryptocurrencies because of some security features. I think he used a software to recreate the wallet and transferred the assets to his own personal wallet.

Topic: Thoughts on this article?
### Original post:
Hayes argued that if BlackRock, which is in ""the asset accumulation game,"" vacuums up all the bitcoin, there will be no more bitcoin transactions and those who secure the bitcoin network in return for fees and newly minted bitcoin, known as miners, ""would be unable to afford the energy it costs to secure the network. As a result, they would shut off their machines. Without the miners, the network dies, and bitcoin vanishes.""<link>

### Reply 1:
If blackrock goes so far as to acquire all bitcoins on the market right now including those that are still unmined, the whole industry will collapse but not for the reasons they state. If anything I think the whole industry will do just fine soon as every bitcoin is mined and is acquired by the people, but having one entity, and a capitalistic enterprise for that matter take over the whole bitcoin network will leave bad taste in the mouths of the people, which would mean that we'd either leave the bitcoin industry, or we'd leave crypto for good cause if they could acquire the top dog there's no reason for them to not take over the rest. And while you guys may argue that ETFs are given publicly anyway, so it's not like they are acquiring bitcoin for themselves, it still is going to be the only thing that would pop into the people's minds when they hear about bitcoin ETF, and impressions last in this industry for a long long while. Miners are gonna do just fine, that's for sure. I don't think the industry would do great if it gets ridden with companies from the outside market taking a stake out of what bitcoin could offer. Judging how we hate centralization in the first place, having<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 2:
There's many ways that this article could be construed.It could be construed as pre-approval fud, to add some fear to the market and around the ETF decision which has been overly positive to date. It could also be construed as a new reveal of truth, right before an inevitable decision, and may bring people back to the reality of what institutions are really in the game for.Either way, it will be interesting to see what happens post ETF and what effect these institutions will have on the Bitcoin network. It doesn't seem entirely logical to assume that BlackRock will be capable of vacuuming enough of the Bitcoin supply to make the entire network inactive, that would assume that everyone sells their BTC to them. There are too many of us that wouldn't do this.What interests me most, is the hint of an adaptation of Bitcoin that will take its place. I know there are some alternatives out there that are also decentralized and have a higher chance of real world adoption, though they haven't yet stood the time test that Bitcoin has.Intrigued to see the events that soon unfold...

Topic: Dream of buying a bike with Bitcoin came true thanks to Bitcoin and my parents
### Original post:
First of all I would like to thank my parents because it is only because of their unwavering efforts that I have succeeded in fulfilling my dream today.Ever since my childhood I had many wishes to buy a bike and I always shared those wishes with my parents. My parents tried a lot to buy me a bike but due to financial problems they never succeeded in buying me a bike. Finally I am undecided whether I will invest and that investment will be in Bitcoin. I explained a lot to my parents about this, they told me that you wait for a few more days, we will buy you a bike immediately, just don't risk so much money. I explained to them that success in life cannot be achieved without taking risks. So dad decided to sell his old bike and promised to give me some of his deposit and mom told me that she has some gold ornaments and the money from selling them will be given to me to invest. But I was having a lot of trouble to take this money and still I took the money and invested it in Bitcoin. I think God was with me because at the time I invested, Bitcoin was worth $16K. But after investing I was always very worried and always monitored the market. I used to feel very bad when the market went <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
First of all I would like to tell you that bicycle prices are normal in the area where I live. I can easily buy a bicycle with a small amount of money. But I didn't talk about buying a bicycle. I talked about buying a bike. And the bike that my father had was a bit old model so I didn't ride that bike unless I had to, that's why I wanted to buy a good quality bike from my childhood. And so much for buying that bike.

### Reply 2:
Congratulations on your success. Bitcoin has fulfilled the dreams of many like you and continues to do so and many are losing through it so it is the fortune of many and the misfortune of many. It is very plausible that your father sells his old bike and your mother sells jewelry to give you money to invest in bitcoins. It's nice to hear such a story, but it remains to be seen how true it is. I would expect you to prove the wallet address where you bought and sold the bitcoins through the message sign of that Address. Because such false stories are seen a lot lately. Because now many people are adopting various false techniques to earn merit

Topic: Offline bitcoin vending machine using lightning
### Original post:
Here's an interesting project that uses lightning to create a completely offline bitcoin vending machine. It's even battery powered, so you can just grab it and use it anywhere.Video: <link> <link> works basically displaying a specific QR code for lightning, once a lightning wallet scans it, it generates a PIN.Under the hood it uses the LNURL-pay protocol to create a PIN which is displayed in the lightning wallet. The user then types the PIN in the machine and the product is delivered.This sounds like a really useful way to sell stuff in conferences, meetups, etc, as it's very portable and easy to use.

### Reply 1:
I guess that they can fit as well at every corner of the street, or supermarkets, or bus/tram/train stations in coffee, snacks or tickets vending machines. I can't wait!

### Reply 2:
I'm quite impressed with how everything looks and works, but it's worth noting that the price shown [$250] in the title of the above video, is just for the vending machine alone [depending on certain situations and our locations, the overall cost is around $350 to $400]!With a bit of creativity, you can use it to sell your domains

Topic: Disoriented Bitcoin User
### Original post:
Good morning, or whatever pertains to you at the time of reading this. I have followed Bitcoin for years, almost since the very beginning and recently I have become detached from it; I do not like this.My question to the community is this -""What do you suggest someone who was informed about Bitcoin, but has lived under a rock for 6-months learns or reads about Bitcoin to catch up?""I'm looking for something good to read, watch, contemplate or consider and it doesn't necessarily need to be a recent development if it's something relatively unknown.Although this is more for a personal enrichment, I do think it would be helpful for newcomers as well as those of us that are ""rusty"".

### Reply 1:
Some of the notable ""events"" that I remember on the top of my head, but you might've probably heard of already, that I'll list anyway just so if you've missed any of them:July 16: Twitter hackers who targeted Elon Musk and others received $121,000 in bitcoin, analysis showsAugust 11: MicroStrategy becomes first listed company to buy bitcoin as part of its capital allocation strategyOctober 8: Square Invests $50 Million in BitcoinOctober 15: Taproot Has Been Merged Into Bitcoin Core: Heres What That MeansOctober 21: PayPal allows Bitcoin and crypto spending December 12: Pornhub Might Have To Push Bitcoin AdoptionAlso, Specter Wallet has been getting a lot of attention on Twitter since the past few months:<link>

It's actually a solid answer, because it's sort of a ""teach a man to fish"" situation. Sometimes the simpler things evade me. I don't know why I hadn't thought to do this. I hadn't heard of any of those events. I'll probably stumble across them when I start doing as LeGaulois has suggested, though. This gives me a few freebies, and I appreciate that.Many of us have.

Topic: The bitcoin wiki needs help
### Original post:
The Bitcoin Wiki is a great place to put information of lasting value with a much higher information density than forum threads with hundreds of pages but it only works if enough people contribute in a constructive way.With this post I would like to both advertise to use it and ask how people get more rights there aka. who's in charge?The deletion requests has over 200 items accumulated which of 95% can be acted upon immediately and the others need a determined voting to get to a conclusion. Delaying this is bad.Less appreciated articles lurk around since years without getting either support that would justify their survival or in my opionion the deletion that's long over-due.There is tons to do and with more hands helping, the wiki could really be even more awesome than it already is

### Reply 1:
Well, I appreciate your offer but in the wiki there is no guidance right now. Look into the special pages if you feel like cleaning up stuff.Most of these lists help find sites that may be deleted.Orphaned pages might not have been visited in ages. Either link them from where it makes sense or suggest deletion.Pages with just one contributor that were not edited in a year and not visited in months might be candidates for deletion.Popular pages might be worth putting some love in the design and content. Make them look pleasing. Add references. Add more facts. Add an image or two. Remove ""noise"".In general, put pages on your watch list and care about changes. Vandalism happens (like referral link spam or people trying to change bitcoin addresses to their own addresses) and with a vigilante community, these survive only some seconds or minutes.Read the discussion pages if you feel like something is not ok with a page. You will find other people's suggestions that you might want to comment on or add suggest your changes.Be bold. If you think it's a good idea to <truncated> an article, do it. Reverting this is much less work than doing it in the first place and as long as you don't star<rest of post truncated>

Thank you for the link. To me it seams this effort to recruit admins failed last year but not due to the lack of willing and trust-worthy people. I bumped the other thread and am curious of the outcome.Also this thread is hereby closed as a duplicate.

Topic: Questions of the day concerning Bitcoin payment
### Original post:
Is increasing gas fee for BTC the only way to speed up its transaction speed? Also how can one use a lightening network in a BTC wallet? I've heard about this but I don't know so much about it..Apart from Bitcoin is it fine to add other coins as a means of payment in your local business? Is this fine or it's better to stay with Bitcoin only.

### Reply 1:
A sidenote so you don't get confused: the term ""gas fee"" is used for the ethereum chain... We don't talk about gas fees in relation to bitcoin (we just talk about ""fees"" or ""transaction fees"").But to answer your question: as a ""normal"" user, you can pay a sufficiently high fee, so the miners put your transaction into the block they're trying to solve instead of someone else's... If you don't you'll have to wait untill all transactions with a higher fee (in sats/vbyte of transaction data) are gone from the mempool (or at least untill a miner decides to add your transaction to the block he/she is trying to solve). If you pay to little fee, there are ways to solve this... For example: by paying a miner directly to include your transaction, by executing a CPFP or by bumping the fee (in case you opted in RBF).The rest of your questions were answered by OmegaStarScream

### Reply 2:
As for your local Business, I would advise you stay with bitcoin, because at a local level, I believe bitcoin is one of the major and easy to get coin you will see at that level.

Topic: Are miners or investors more important?
### Original post:
I don't understand why people spend 1700 dollars on a mining rig, when they could spend that same 1700 dollars on investing into bitcoins, because you are not guaranteed a return if you mine solo, only if you pool, and at that point investing would be the better option as your return to time to risk ratio would be much profitable than any other method of acquiring bitcoins.I am actually looking to invest in bitcoins very soon. is it even possible to buy large amounts of btc at once?

### Reply 1:
Depends on what you mean by ""large"". Anything under $100,000 worth shouldn't be too difficult. Much larger amounts than that are possible, but not as easy and certainly not advisable, as bitcoin's market cap is only around $100,000,000 at the moment, so it only takes few million dollars or so to seriously disrupt the market.

### Reply 2:
the way i see my mining hardware investment (when i'm actually able to make it...) is long term. if i buy 100 coins today, then the price goes up over the next five years, awesome. but if i'm mining for those same five years, i'll probably not only generate significantly more then 100 BTC, but i'll be less afraid to spend it (on more mining hardware, maybe!) if i have a steady supply of BTC coming in. now, right now buying any hardware is incredibly risky, with the whole ASIC thing pending. i'm in sit and wait mode, as far as new hardware goes. not enough info out there from any of the products for my taste.

Topic: Sending Crypto to the wrong address
### Original post:
We're developing something to reduce human error in crypto transactions, especially those in which some mistake was made when writing the receiver address.Can you guys help us have a greater perception on the user side?Did it happen to you?How comfortable are you every time you transfer to a remote address?Would you be more comfortable using a helper?What do you use today to mitigate this risk?Thanks

### Reply 1:
We don't need that.If you write an address manually and make a mistake, it's almost impossible that it's a valid address and your wallet or the service you are using won't allow you to make transaction.

### Reply 2:
Being in this space needs a lots of responsibility. Never happened to me, coz I always check the receiving address before sending.To prevent incident like this, what platform should do is to show a summary of the transaction before a user send it. E.g showing address, amount and what coin. With this, user can review not twice but many times before clicking the confirm button to send.

Topic: Why mixers?
### Original post:
Recently a man was deceived by someone who had change the electrum source code on an old version of it. He lost 1400BTC(!)I had made a similar question in the past, but the answer didn't satisfy me. Why should that hacker use a mixer? If he try to sell the bitcoins from his main address (the one with the 1400BTC) he will get caught, because he will prove that he is the hacker.If he send 1BTC to 1400 owned addresses, though, no one can prove that the person that owns those 1400 addresses is the hacker, right? They can only ask them where did you get that one bitcoin.

### Reply 1:
And one day he will recive a letter from local police station that he is being summoned for a questioning as a witness in a crime. He will have to take a day off and appear at the police on pain of a fine or restriction of liberty. Explain himself, provide source of this 1 BTC. As part of the investigation, the police may confiscate computer / telephone for months. What for? Just mix and pay 1-5% fee. Or deposit to exchange x, exchange to monero, deposit to exchange Y, withdraw bitcoin.

### Reply 2:
Lets say there is the following chain of transactions:1,400 BTC from a known hacked wallet to a known hacker's addressThat 1,400 BTC is then split in to 1 BTC chunks and sent to 1,400 other addressesSomeone then deposits 1 BTC from one of those addresses to an exchangeWhat is the chance that the hacker has sold all 1,400 BTC simultaneously in exactly equal 1 BTC chunks and sent them to 1,400 different addresses? How did he sell them all so quickly? How did he find enough buyers? Why did every buyer want exactly 1 BTC? The chances of this happening are astronomically small. The only logical conclusion is that the same person depositing that 1 BTC is the same person who hacked the 1,400 BTC. Best case scenario then is his coins are seized by the exchange; worst case the exchange are handing his IP and KYC details over to law enforcement. Even if the hacker bounces the 1,400 BTC around multiple different addresses in multiple different amounts over multiple different transactions, it is still fairly trivial to trace them all back to the initial address.That's why you use mixers. Good mixers will completely break the chain between inputs and outputs.

Topic: Like the idea but getting discouraged...
### Original post:
I really like the idea of bitcoin, I think it will be looked back on like the invention of the light bulb.But, I don't seem to have a good way to get some bitcoins. I have .05 from the faucet, and I appreciate that, but I'd like to get a larger amount.I'm running the generator on my computer, but the calculator says it will take on average several months to generate a single block, and the difficulty will probably keep going up so I'll never get one.I wanted to buy some from Mt. Gox, so I signed up there, and then I have to sign up for Liberty Reserve to fund it. Then it turns out the only way I can do that is through ANOTHER third party, who only wants to accept money from other ""internet currencies"" which are only available from internet currency exchangers. In other words, if I want to pay in USD, there seems to be absolutely no starting point to get it into the system.There are people offering to sell bitcoins for cash in the mail, but who knows what they'll do if the exchange rate varies while it's in the mail.It's extremely frustrating.

### Reply 1:
Well, if gaining bitcoins was very easy, it wouldn't worth that much, would it ?Yes, it is not as easy as buying some shoes. Because bitcoins seller will not be very happy to use current paiement method (credit cards and stuffs). So you have to accept some risk. Personnaly I bought my first bitcoins with cash in the mail. I lost 10$ trying to deal with bitcoin2cash. I succeeded in buying for 30$ though, with bitcoin4cash.You can consider selling real stuffs for bitcoins. I sold some linux stickers (you want some ? PM me) for 40 BTC. I also sold some silver and 7 grams of gold.Earning money is no easy task. If you find a good way to do it, let me know.

### Reply 2:
Do you use amazon? If you regularly shop there I have a deal where you get %1 of your purchase back in bitcoins simply for shopping through the links on the site. Im currently updating the site with other deals to follow the same idea.Latest ones-Popcap games %5Buy.com %1etc.....

Topic: Hocnet: A competitively decentralized internet using Bitcoins
### Original post:
Has anybody seen this description of Hocnet? It's billed as ""A competitively decentralized internet."" It seems to be a sort of p2p mesh network where nodes that provide services such as routing are rewarded with payment. Although there's been some discussion on how to do payment, Bitcoin figures prominently in the plans. I think the financial incentive to miners in Bitcoin is one of the major drivers of its success so far, so I believe that the same kind of financial incentive to mesh net operators could be a huge driver of mesh net deployment.<link>

### Reply 1:
Good question. It's addressed here:<link> Hocnet is focused on payment for mesh net services and relies on other elements of darknet type stuff for the actual network technology.

### Reply 2:
It seems that development stuck on how to implement the payment method because Bitcoin by it self can't accommodate it. Was Rapidly-adjusted (micro)payments considered?This seems like a perfect match, but the method relies on Transaction Replacement feature that is not yet implemented. The last I heard about it was from this thread: Trustless, instant, off-the-chain Bitcoin payments

Topic: Entering the Privacy & Anonymity Atmosphere. What are the costs?
### Original post:
Throughout this one decade since Bitcoin's genesis, cryptocurrencies have advanced to a point where we now have a general idea of what makes Bitcoin better than other cryptocurrencies, why we need certain functions to be added to Bitcoin and so on.One particular concern I have been confronting for a while now is how improving privacy through Bitcoin may change the King of cryptocurrencies forever - and it may actually be for the worse.To be fair, I am heavily obsessed with privacy and a lot of members out here probably already know it. I have a lot of respect for those who fight for their own right to be anonymous and to have the wanted level of anonymity without being considered a criminal by anyone else. So props to o_e_l_e_o, LoyceV and all the other users who've taught me a lot of stuff about this. You've helped me turn it into an obsession. Today we are slowly disrupting the equilibrum between pseudonymity and anonymity to the point where anonymity takes the lead. With that being said, by taking a look over both what's getting ready for the next Bitcoin updates and what we already have, we can see that the list of things that give you more privacy through Bitcoin increased sig<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
I wouldn't describe myself as someone who is obsessed about my privacy, maybe cause I'm only just recently realizing the dangers of identity leaks and data harvesting. I currently take the most practical steps to reasonably protect myself.As said above by @o_e_l_e_o, we should create an environment where there should not be any cost of wanting to maintain anonymity while transacting, that is sort of the reason that originally attracted people to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. At this point in time, the system is not too hostile and one can still navigate through anonymously, whether it would be worth it in five or ten years would depend on the adaptations and evolutions that would take place.Bitcoin was stiffly met with hostility from centralized sectors when it was launched, the government's are probably taking an alternative approach to put a leash on the network if they can not outrightly control it. I would rather we had a more privacy centered community which governments would struggle to regulate than the other option - Ease and convenience usually comes at the cost of privacy and decentralization.

### Reply 2:
Every new projects came with a unique feature(s) just for the purpose of overcoming bitcoin in the system after bitcoin was created, the exhibited feature of Monero is the default genesis from beginning as stated on whitepaper as to come out with something unique from others, but its fine, meanwhile, same malicious acts and criminality had both occurred using Monero and bitcoin and many others too, but at such bitcoin wins because of its first mover advantage not because of its moderate/less privacy system. This implies the stability, bitcoin had acquired even if it accepts same characteristics of excessive privacy policy.In a rare sense, Monero higher privacy is good one and i can't see the reason why there's this rejection and delisting of XMR token, and if so, same rejection should also goes to mixers too as well. Conclusively, bitcoin would still be adopted either with more or less privacy policy because of its first mover advantage and wide usage.I might sound too off point but pardon my manners about my question I'm going to ask o_e_l_e_o, at your personal text, you opened to buying XMR for btc, ""ain't this negative and repulsive news from OP about Monero stops you from accep<rest of post truncated>

Norways financial supervisory authority released a Risk and Vulnerability analysis ... compares bitcoin to monopoly money ... noting that U.S. authorities have signaled they want to remove this system. <link>

### Reply 1:
Already discussed here:<link> think we should chill a little bit, for all we know, perhaps the employee that wrote the piece just googled and found the Schumer comments:<link> count on most Norwegian Departments to allways be telling the correct facts or the truth. I highly doubt that the US will crack down on bitcoin. And we shouldn't take what comes from the US govt. at face value either.Fact is, we don't simply know if bitcoin is just another state sponsored project. TOR and Stuxnet is two examples of other state sponsored sophisticated software.So unless somebody takes their time and contact the Norwegian Financial Authority about the matter and get somthing of more substance, we shouldn't start making a feather into 10 chickens at this point.But on another note, if the US went public with that they wanted to ban bitcoin, oh the Streisand effect, then surely a few more millions users would learn about it and how they could use it for all sorts of purposes online, that would add to the popularity of bitcoin actually.

Nah, don't believed anything that John McAfee is saying, specially that he has a questionable history.And I guarantee that he blurted it out so that he will became relevant in the crypto discussion again. Because once he 'disowns' his so called $1 million prediction, and calling bitcoin an ancient past, this clown was totally forgotten. Anyway, we should taken any statement from John with a bag of salt.

Cointelegraph is just reporting the news, which is what it heard and what it sees, nothing wrong with doing that even though it knows it is 100% John McAfee being John McAfee.Satoshi Nakamoto is not a guy who would talk to a loudmouth who accepts bribes to shill projects. Nothing to see here but friendly entertainment.

Topic: Massive adoption of BTC could reduce the Transaction fee.
### Original post:
If a vendor wants $10 per day profit from 10qty of goods, he'll simply attach $1 profit on each of the goods making the total profit $10.Now, if the QTY of his goods he sell increases to $100 per day, he should be able to sell at a cheaper rate. Making the profit on each goods $0.1, or if he wishes to maintain the $1 profit, he would still make much profit. Why does the BTC model differ? If there is a congestion in the network, the transaction fee becomes high. Does it therefore means that, if BTC is massively adopted, the transaction fee will be outrageous?

### Reply 1:
This is great. I stumbled on a poll created by @Pmalek about the Lightening Network few hours ago, it was informative and interesting. And now I have encountered it again. With LN it therefore means that the problem of BTC high fee is 50% solved.Thanks for sharing.

### Reply 2:
Users who move their coins from quality personal wallets have the absolute power to decide the fee levels they are going to send at. The problem is that most users overpay because they rely on their wallet's fee estimates, which are usually bad. Another reason users overpay is if they are paying for certain services or goods and they only have a limited window of 10-20 minutes to send and have the transaction confirmed, unless they don't want to be subjected to having to pay additional coins due to bitcoin's volatility. And then we have crypto exchanges and gambling sites who always overpay on the fees to avoid customer complaints and delays in withdrawals.All this affects the fee calculators that most people use, and without looking at the mempool manually, users just agree to whatever fees are suggested to them. Theoretically, all users could send their coins at 1 sat/Vbyte and those would be included in blocks. But there would be a huge race of who gets in. The community has great power in deciding the network fees, they just don't use it and many times, they aren't in the position to do so.

### Original post:
Bitcoin is very famous already and Bitcoin gained so much in value (for example Bitcoin was around 250$ in 2014 and is now (2022) at 40,000$). As a result, many people are rich from Bitcoin now and some are rich enough to cash out a bit (like USA where its very common to cash out Bitcoin because Bitcoin is adopted, especially in California). Being and getting rich from Bitcoin is not a self-fulfilling prophecy and people need to work hard for it: HODL In gratitude for it, we can see common patterns. Very likely, Bitcoin will continue to be a formidable store of value like Gold and Bitcoin will deliever a good competition against Gold as a store of value. But what are rich Bitcoin people and aspiring rich Bitcoin people doing else except Bitcoin? Lets collect some facts! - Owning a large house and a pool- Large glass front in direction of your pool- Watering your large garden extensively- Your garden is always in top style- Living in a mediterranean climate zone (or similar warm areas, like California (or Florida))- If you dont own a large house and a pool, you are living on a rooftop (including a pool)- Advocating for a free market- Owning an American Flag (Murica!) and supporting <rest of post truncated>

You are right, Bitcoin can be a real game changer for everyone. But to be successful, we can also be normal, private citizens and don't need to be enterpreneurs. Some very early HODLers are private citizens, like Lazlo but he should have kept a few of his Bitcoins, when he purchased his Pizza. It's unfortunate for him but he was an early Bitcoiner.

### Reply 2:
they will probably buy it back after selling it above $60k and I know they will wait for the price below $20k to buy it back, usually people who are long in bitcoin and hold it are not that easily lulled by their wealth throwing their money away, of course they will spin the money them to multiply profits

Live cost can be pretty high in those places, and 1 of those currencies is worth nothing.just like 1 satoshi is worthless to us (cannot even be transacted), a currency which is worth less than 1 satoshi per unit, that unit is worthless as well.You cannot buy a lunch with 1 satoshi in Venezuela. Everything there is calculated in thousands or millions. We lived that in Brazil few years ago. And from time to time government just cut off 3 zeros from fiat value, and life goes on.Those metrics are just useless...

OP,why do you think that this is ""very important information""?Who cares about the national currencies of <truncated> info doesn't mean anything.People in those countries seem to be OK with their national currencies(maybe except Venezuela)and I don't see these countries adopting bitcoin anytime soon.

Topic: You Think Bitcoin Save Your Economy
### Original post:
With the recent situation with the pandemic going on. Has created many economic challenges for all.Do you think Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency could really help people bring back their economy?This be in the form of trading. Use of the currency? creation of? education. etcWhat are your thoughts on this. Could this cryptocurrency help people give some new direction?

### Reply 1:
I think what @Upgrade00 said is true, for a global scale it doesn't have a significant impact. and will only have an impact on individual crypto users who already held it before the pandemic came. as for most people who end up flocking to save their assets during a pandemic and store them in bitcoin, it is temporary. because we have to know, between longtime crypto users either during the pandemic or before the pandemic, and they are still surviving.for those who only know that bitcoin is a savior of assets in times of crisis, that doesn't sound very good. maybe for a while it will be very effective, but gradually they will return to a situation where everything has been exchanged into their respective fiat currencies.

### Reply 2:
Definitely Bitcoin can save economy of country, if a country is serious into it, just take a look of certain countries that embraced cryptocurrency, they are most digital and developing country now, and take a look of those countries that abandoned or restrict cryptocurrency, just compare them and check the differences, so it's obvious that cryptocurrency can equally bring a country who invest in it into life when their are shortages of economy and when crisis happen, it will be easier for such country to recover their lost within short time after crisis, so in all ramifications cryptocurrency will enhance elevation of country economy if it's really plan well by their finance minister or ministry.

Topic: Reusing an existing Ledger seed phrase
### Original post:
So a few years ago I got a Ledger, which I then sold afterward (after reformatting) but not without keeping the original seed phrases (card itself is with me).Will I be able to restore the keys anywhere on a decentralized wallet such as Electrum, instead of purchasing another hardware wallet?

### Reply 1:
What pooya87 said. But why stop using a hardware wallet? There's no reason to not use one unless you're only planning on holding crypto that's only worth less than probably $200. Don't fall for the ""I can keep my device safe"" excuse, because most people simply aren't capable.

### Reply 2:
Reuse address is bad. Reuse old wallet is bad too.You can create a new wallet and send your Bitcoin to a new wallet.It's better if you use Sweep function. You don't have to create a new wallet and manually send your coin to a new address you own. Sweeping will automatically do it for you.In Electrum:Wallet > Private keys > SweepRead Electrum guide<link> Vs Sweeping Private Keys; What you need to know.

I got this notification from a telegram channel which I follow. It is a telegram channel of a Youtube influencer who talks about cryptocurrency in his regional language. When I checked the notification from that channel it stated I was curious to know that Barclays had invested in Bitcoin! Did a simple search and found the accurate story. If your read the complete article you will know that this investment has nothing to do with <truncated> this is how influencers and media has been promoting their hidden objective, that is to earn money no matter what can be the consequences and what it may end up?This is why you need to do a search before believing anything promoted.

I believe some news source were to an entent not to be treated as genuine and reliable and that's why I personally don't give in for reading any whow news that are not from a reputable source, bloggers make use of key words just to entice us read through their articles of earn per click threads, we have to be very care especially some news could appear to be too real to be true, in such scenario then an alternative consult may be made regarding such before believing or spreading such news as well.There are some also that may come with a malicious attacks embodiments unknowingly, those kinds of punicode sites that targets phishing accounts details, i will advise to also verify a news from source, content and site used just to be in safety and off any form of an attacks and their shit posts.

influencers get paid to speak. or tweak their message to whatever drama/trend gets them most noticed in the hope of getting paid due to high subscriber numbersthey are not interested in the truth, they just want to clickbait stories to get more viewers to get paid moreits like TV doctors. if your too busy being on TV selling snake oil's then your not actually being a real doctor treating real patients(dr Oz, Dr Phil, and that idiot paid by alex jones). anyone that has time to do book tours, speaking gigs at conferences and regular podcasts/vlogs is doing it for the money, not for the actual desire to speak <truncated> like this forum. anyone with adverts in their avatar or footer just want to speak BS just to get as many messages made to earn as much as they can in their campaigns.always DYOR (do your own research) and never ROSM(Rely on Social Media)

### Original post:
Up until relatively recently, cryptocurrency hadnt captured the interest of the general public; it was reserved almost exclusively for the engineers, developers, and entrepreneurs who had been involved in its conception around a decade ago.However, the bitcoin bubble in 2017 caused cryptocurrencies to soar in value, and led to millions purchasing cryptoshares and even setting up their own mining farms.Despite the considerable drop in the value of bitcoin over the past year, experts are predicting a new cryptocurrency boom in the near future, possibly from 2020.

There should be some big names from the dot com era that are heavily invested in crypto.Recently I've seen a documentary about Netscape and there were some mentions of cryptos from some people.In that list there is also missing Mark Cuban! I'm 100% certain the he is invested!

### Reply 2:
Definitely there are more celebrities in the network than we can imagine,they hardly live a secret life,so most would tend to keep their cryptocurrency investments private,though one or two would definitely be made known to the public.This is a potential investment that has a high amount of ROI based on one's investments,many celebrities are wealthy,so they have more opportunities to earn high the network,i don't see them missing out

According to The Block, up to 61% of Bitcoin hodlers could sell at a profit. Towards the end of the year, should Bitcoin prices stay about $8,000 per coin, 61% of hodlers could sell in their cryptocurrency. The Block looked at the overall potential to sell at a profit, with regards to both old adopters, and new traders. <link> is hodling? So, what exactly is hodling? According to eToro, to hodl is to to hold on to your coins, even when the market dips, rather than sell up and cash out. If you dont have a lot of time for trading on your hands, this is most likely the strategy for you. Some of the most successful Bitcoin hodlers include the Winklevoss Twins, Satoshi Nakamoto (the founder and creator of Bitcoin), and exchanges. <link> Hodling Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is a pretty surefire way of earning profit on your coins. Riding out the fluctuations of the market is preferable to selling at a low because youve given into FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt).

100% holder at 3000$ could sell with profit.I don't think 61% is a reasonable nubmer, and it's just clueless.what about people who bought at 20k, or 15k, because 15-20k is the range that they buy and sell so much. very big volume, and some of them might never take back half of invested money.

Any other information you'd like to see on this website?Thanks!

### Reply 1:
Thanks a lot mk4 for your feedback!Good point on both the domain and the APY amounts. Maybe we could add a calculator too, so that you could see for a given amount of BTC the actual APY across the different platforms.

### Reply 2:
Website is looking fine but I would like to see risk information notifications for users that any Bitcoin sent to this centralized platforms is not their anymore.They are trusting some third party website to give them some small profit, and if they go down and hacked customers could loss all their money.You could also add information what service was hacked and breached, I know about BlockFi but maybe there are others.

### Original post:
<link> it's not really saying all that much to say they'll accept it ""If it becomes huge and accepted""... but it's definitely not outright hostility.Perhaps he's viewing Bitcoin more as 'just another currency' than a payment mechanism.Also reported in Press thread:<link>

### Reply 1:
Yeah.. I'd have expected him to say something more negative, as I viewed Bitcoin as more of a direct competitor to the ideas behind Square - but I admit I don't fully understand what Square is aiming at.It was just surprising to me that he was at worst neutral, perhaps even slightly welcoming towards Bitcoin.

Exactly.Because you have other tech names like Django core developer Alex Gaynor doing everything he can to crap on bitcoin: - <link> supporting the use of Bitcoin for software-developer tipping platform GitTip:- <link> it is good to see @Jack not dismissing Bitcoin out of hand as something they might use some day. (though it would be cannibalistic as Bitcoin is not just a currency but a payment system, but hey -- if Square wants to add the capability where they become a front-end for Bitcoin transactions and save a little on interchange fees, that would be fantastic for Bitcoin!)I described how today a merchant can use Square's register even though Bitcoin is the payment method:

Topic: What will happen if we find THE REAL SATOSHI ??
### Original post:
Just curious I have seen many news about who claim to be satoshi and who might be satoshi. Let say we skip the part where we got the proof satoshi then what. Will the price go up??What will he do next

### Reply 1:
I think at this time it's not important that who is inventor of bitcoin! because there are many developers around bitcoin now, no need searching inventor of bitcoin! but we are definitely intersted about inventor of bitcoin to know about him, because he was inventor of bitcoin and also beginner of cryptocurrency, he is a respectable person as a inventor of cryptocurrency.

### Reply 2:
it depends on a dozen things in my opinion.for starters it depends on who the real Satoshi is. for instance if we find out that Hal Finney was the real Satoshi then it could even boost the confidence in price.the next thing would be the timing of that revelation. for example if we have reached mass adoption and the market has grown to a decent size then it won't affect the price that much but while we are still in a small market that can be easily manipulated, the effects can be big and in any direction which is unpredictable at this point.

Topic: Bitcoin and Inflation and why bitcoin?
### Original post:
We are in a time of crisis and I have to say that inflation is so high, it affects everything. A lot of people have been expecting bitcoin to exert its anti-inflation properties, and then things didn't go as expected, assets like bitcoin are not immune to short-term negative effects. I see that many people are starting to be negative and skeptical about bitcoin's ability to fight inflation.But if we don't just look at the short term but look at the long term, looking to the future. We'll see what bitcoin can do.+ In 2010: with 10,000BTC we will buy 2 pizzas.+ In 2016: with 100BTC we can buy a car.+ In 2022: with only 10BTC we will buy a house, maybe many countries will not need 10BTC to own a house, sometimes only 3BTC to 5BTC.Just looking at these things, I can tell you that, if BTC is not the best anti-inflation asset, you won't find a second asset that is more inflation-resistant than BTC.Let's feel for ourselves what is going on in our daily life, is this true? I believe you will have your own final answer.source pic: <link> Fiat is designed to die slowly.source pic: <link> is always true if we zoom out and look at the history of bitcoin.Buy bitcoins before it's too late.<link>

### Reply 1:
Inflation's built into fiat currencies by the central banks which seems like a bizarre stipulation that most fiat users don't even think about. It's targeted at 2% yearly under stable currencies. Unstable <truncated> would only dream of a 2% inflation rate. Losing 2% of your purchasing power year over year is massive, and that's in the best case scenario when the central banks can keep a balance on the economy. If they choose to ramp up the money printer, it'll reach a large multiple of 2%.For folks that think Bitcoin's fluctuation in price is too much to handle, I'd argue that a guaranteed yearly loss on your purchasing power is worse.

### Reply 2:
3BTC can buy a house in my country. maybe even 2 houses if you chose outside the city.an early investor can look at BTC as a hedge which is really true when we zoom out. of course for new investors it look different particularly to those who bought at the price peak.

Topic: Change with the flow
### Original post:
I just created a thread where I used the word ""Golden opportunity"" which led me to a though that is we crypto enthusiast should start using the words as ""Bitcoinish opportunity"" or ""bitcoin opportunity"" right? I think we need to upgrade our vocabulary as and when there is a change. Like crypto enthus value bitcoin more than gold then why golden opportunity. What do you think?

### Reply 1:
@Mandoy I would say it has an impact. The flow of the terminology may hit the ears of people who are not yet exposed to bitcoin yet. I would say for those how are still living in dark. They will share and read about Bitcoin. This publicity might not be a requirement for Bitcoin as it is way more strong by it technology but, it can help blowing the bulbs of those who are still unaware.Don't you think so?

### Reply 2:
I like the idea, although it will be very hard to make that a reality.There's literally hundreds of years of tradition that makes people say ""golden opportunity"", ""gold standard"" and things like that.Even after dozens of years in the fiat world, that hasn't changed to ""dollar opportunity"", so if we ever see that change, I figure it will be hundreds of years from now.

Topic: Nuclear and gas fastest growing energy sources for Bitcoin mining: Data
### Original post:
<link> to the report, coal alone accounts for 37% of total bitcoin mining electricity consumption in 2022. Among sustainable energy source, hydroelectric power accounts for 15%. In the report, clean energy generation for mining bitcoin has increased if compared to 2021.We can see on the images how fossil fuel energy production is decreasing, while clean energy production like natural gas and nuclear energy are increasing.

### Reply 1:
Bitcoin Mining Council report has an information that the percent of sustainable electricity mix has increase of 6% from 2021 to 2022, Q2.I think it is a good transition but it is a normal change because more geographical areas have been involved in bitcoin mining. We see in newly adopted locations for Bitcoin mining, they have good sustainable electricity resources.

### Reply 2:
I'm hopeful that the shift toward cleaner sources of energy will be swift. It's important to break away from what's ruining our environment, and if Bitcoin can shift, it'll be inspiring for other industries as well as help Bitcoin's reputation. I still don't think that Bitcoin should be blamed on the scale it gets blamed, as electricity sources are often not something people can easily choose (there's a big role played by the country you live in, and how its energy system operates). Moreover, the argument that Bitcoin mining is unnecessary and should thus be stopped doesn't quite hold when there's tons of gaming people do, which also isn't necessary and affects the environment, and yet nobody's strongly campaigning against GPU and CPU companies to make them stop making even more power-hungry products.

Hello Soldiers!As you know, Bit-pay (and Gox) are currently at the massive CES show in vegas. It's happening RIGHT NOW. There is huge media potential there, and we all know the media LOVES twitter these days, what with Egypt revolting and all. So, it's time for FeedZeBirds+Bitcoin to show its marketing power and blow this shit up!In coordination with Tony from Bit-pay and Roger Ver, I've created several FeedZeBirds twitter campaigns. Each one is tagged with #CES, so every time someone tweets them, it makes it more likely for reporters and pedestrians at CES to see the tweets and visit Tony's booth. This is our goal, to bring foot traffic and press to them. I'm calling on forum comrades to toss a small donation to any of these campaigns. Your donation is immediately paid out to our army of several hundred FeedZeBirds members who will Tweet it. Your donation of .1 buys over 3,000 impressions! I also encourage you to make your own #CES campaign on FeedZeBirds if you know how (extremely easy) - just make sure you mention ""#CES"", ""bitcoin"", and ""booth <truncated> <truncated> <truncated> <truncated> <truncated> this is time-sensitive... so do it now!Here are your orders:1) Donate to one <rest of post truncated>

Topic: Indonesia joins the regulation of cryptocurrencies in this 2022
### Original post:
Since blockchain technology was implemented and spread throughout the world, a wide variety of countries have decided to create measures to include cryptocurrencies as a new form of payment, such as Indonesia, which has been seeking the regulation of crypto assets for some time, and this It is due to the great increase in Indonesians who are investing in these currencies, especially in Bitcoin, it is estimated that from 2020 to 2021 BTC transactions increased 14 times more, demonstrating how popular these assets have become in that country; BAPPEBTI, the governing body, in charge of maintaining control of the trade, declared its intention, expressing in an official statement that ""With the new rules that we had published, it is expected that we and cryptocurrency exchanges in Indonesia can work together to help ensure that every cryptocurrency transaction is legally regulated and safe for investors in Indonesia."" a good outlook is expected this 2022 for the Indonesian territory.How would the regulation of cryptocurrencies help the country?SOURCE: <link>

### Reply 1:
the percentage of tax that will be applied is very low when compared to other Asian countries such as India which imposes 30%. so maybe people in that country won't protest this tax problem. but the fact that crypto is only seen as an asset is also important. it looks like the country wants to regulate crypto without having any desire to adopt it as a currency.

### Reply 2:
Thought his may be the case, any regulation and news can be beneficial to cryptocurrencies in the near future. The fact that Indonesia recognized the need for implementing regulations means that they see its potential effect in the future. I just hope that this regulation would not hinder the development of cryptocurrencies in their country as this can backfire easily and be a double-edged sword.Though there are countries that started accepting BTC as a form of legal tender, we are still far away from such vision where every country would recognize cryptocurrencies as a valid form of payment for services and products.

Topic: How to Get Rich Quick - Bitcoin
### Original post:
Ok, it is not what you are thinking. Bitcoin is not a Get rich quick scheme, but the UK series ""How To Get Rich Quick - Season 1 episode 3 includes some footage of a rich entrepreneur, Dave Fishwick, creator of Bank of Dave, discussing Crypto currencies as one investment option to become rich. Luckily for us, the Bitcoin price at the time, generated a small profit when that episode was shot and he even commented that the profit he made then, were the equivalent of 3 years of interest in a local Bank. I made 800%+ profit on my initial investment over a period of 4 years. (200% per year) - Go watch the series, it is full of good tips for the budding entrepreneur out there. <It is also not focusing on Crypto currencies, but all the methods that can be used to increase your wealth> Edit - I wonder how many people will only reply to the Thread title and not on the content of the actual topic now.

### Reply 1:
I took the average of the different profits I made, since I started buying bitcoins on a regular basis. A lot of the coins that I own now, was not coins that I bought, but rather coins that I received for work that was done. (My work pay a percentage of my wages in Bitcoin)It is just nice to see that mainstream movies and series are slowly shifting their focus from ""Bitcoin being bad"" to ""Bitcoin being good"" and that is exactly what we need now.

### Reply 2:
Lol, you got me there @Kakmakr I'm sure that those who thinks that bitcoin is a get rich quick scheme have understand that it's not how it works. But it's really a good investment if you're willing to risk, how much money you wanted to invest and when to book profits. I think my profit is around 800% as well, as I have been buying them when the price is < 4 digits and book some profits in December 2017.

Topic: Ways to prevent 51% attacks from bad actors/states
### Original post:
Im just curious. Would it help the network if say, 1,000,000 people each ran one miner, even if it wasnt profitable. But it would further decentralize the network and make a 51% attack more difficult? If so, why hasnt there been a bigger push in the community to make this happen? Thanks

### Reply 1:
Interesting links. Was not aware of all of this. So its essentially impossible for a 51% attack to happen at this point?

### Reply 2:
Here's my take: if we can get a million folks to each run a miner, it would go a long way in shoring up the network, even if there's no profit to be had. This would make it significantly more difficult for anyone to carry out a 51% attack and ensure the network remains decentralized. However, let's face it, convincing that many people to run a miner without a financial incentive would be an uphill battle. Furthermore, running a miner can be quite pricey, so it's not a viable option for everyone. Nevertheless, this is a thought-provoking concept that merits further contemplation.

Topic: Disappearance of cash and bitcoin as an alternative?
### Original post:
Atm has been disappearing for years now (not completly ). With the Covid crisis, people were encouraged to pay by CB on the pretext that banknotes could carry viruses. Some banks refuse cash deposits and withdrawals. Some currencies are worthless: sometimes they're used to fuel fires, or to create bags (Venezuelan bolivares, for example). What does the future hold for cash, and can btc become an alternative?Thank you

### Reply 1:
No, I don't think so, a lot of transactions are still settled in cash< see and after 2020 more than a quarter of transactions are still settled in cash and it's a preferred option for many when you want to trade from the local store or pay for daily requirements. I expect this percentage to continue to decline, from 71% in 2019 to 25%, which is a significant change, but if we reach zero, this may take more than 50 years.Source61% transactions were settled with debt, which shows that sometimes cash makes us feel guilty when we spend a lot of it. While I can pay 10,000 dollars with a single click, the pain it causes when I pay it with cash is greater.

### Reply 2:
I think the era of cash (paper money) is gradually diminishing as many people turn towards digital currency or even transferring through electronic means. If we read about the recent reports that the fiat devaluation is actually caused by the excessive number of paper money printed not to talk of the expensive amount spend on the printing process this cash, this has actually prompted the government to promote the method of cashless policy which has brought about the creation of fintechs. This factors have had an impact of cash been used less. But I dont think that total cash less policy can be achieved sooner or later because there are rural areas that still the basic network service to run this cashless policy. Also the transaction fees and sometimes the slow payment process during transaction is a thing that would still make it hard to get away from using cash. Yes bitcoin is already an alternative because many people run both inter or intra border transactions using the bitcoin. Because aside the slow transaction process and the high transactions fees it so much more secure than the even the fiat transfers.

Topic: Should the physically challenged be exempted from bitcoin?
### Original post:
I consider how bitcoin adoption is ever increasing each day despite bitcoin running dip in price, many people have seen and taken the good advantage in using the digital currency for many reasons that best suit their needs, now i consider this set of physically challenged people (blind, deaf and dumb) who may also want to make good opportunity out of it for an adoption, as we all know they would have heard about bitcoin but not knowing how to go about it, should we consider them in participating from this great benefits in bitcoin or assume an exemption for them.Why do i need to raise this is because i have centers allocated for these set of people from my location here and i see it a good advantage for them to as well participate in using bitcoin but to be sincere i lack the first move to helping this challenged people out and i see bitcoin as a currency that shouldn't have a barrier of usage just as the fiat is.I will like to hear from our suggestions, various ways we can use to aid these set of people (blind, deaf, dumb) to know about bitcoin, and if there are instructional materials or steps that could help facilitate their awareness to bitcoin, its uses and application.

### Reply 1:
Blind people can use one of many screen readers which already exist for computers, to read the interface of wallets.And cryptocurrencies do not require audio, so deaf people can use crypto normally.

### Reply 2:
We have good content in English about Bitcoin, this content is growing and developing so it can easily be translated to all other languages or even sign language, or used to help the deaf, there are many tools available to convert text, speech or video in English into the languages that Understood by people with special needs.Therefore, disability is not supposed to be a cause, but most activities are related to the return on investment, and because this category is small in the investment world, it is therefore ignored.Community adoption is the best solution at the moment.

Topic: hey
### Original post:
I have a potentially better idea. How about if mtgox limits people from dumping as many or more Bitcoins on the bids that would move the price for 5% or more. Same goes for jumping on asks.So let's say someone wants to dump 1000btc on bids but yet there are only 900btc in bids in the price range from spot to 4.99% below and mtgox simply doesn't accept his order. He can still place it at spot but he can't single handendly crash the price beyond 5%. And if 5% is too little, then how about 10%?Comments?

### Reply 1:
That's kind of why I thought my idea could be beneficial. I was watching what happened this weekend live and the speed and fierceness with which the crash happened probably contributed a great deal towards a larger and more volatile swing.My idea is of course not suppose to stop the market forces from working but at least it can slow them down just a bit so people have more time to react. I don't know.. Naturally I'm not for any type of forced regulations but exchanges can experiment with different type of rules. Just like they allow partial depth table to be seen and dark pool orders they can come up with order placing rules and let the market decide what it likes and what it doesn't.

The person behind this must be some Bitcoin fan. He did not had to disclose his identity to be able to do this. He has to get this printed and get a van hired for some hours. All this can be done without revealing his own identity. He need not pay the person in the poster . I do not encourage phot of some influential people though without their consent for promoting anything. Because this can be abused in a number of ways. My first reaction on seeing the image was that it is photoshopped but I wait for responses on this thread from experts regarding this.

### Reply 2:
Yes, a BTC fan who correctly wants people to know that their money is only safe when it is with them, through buying BTC and holding it in the correct way. That way their money cannot be traded or used to buy assets by third party services like banks and centralized exchanges, just as Silicon valley bank did with their depositors funds and lost it.

Topic: Revision of High transaction fee in bitcoin.
### Original post:
We know that Crypto transaction fees are paid when you do an action on a blockchain. The fees prevent blockchain networks from being flooded with transactions and to prevent legitimate usage of networks.The reason behind the transaction fee could not be limited to;1. Faster confirmation time: Bitcoin transactions are processed by miners, who prioritize transactions with higher fees. We know that every business oriented person is after profit and the highest bidder is welcome first. As we look forward in promoting and spreading the usage and acceptance of bitcoin, this fee should be reviewed.2. Network congestion: During times of high demand on the Bitcoin network, there may be a backlog of unconfirmed transactions. The fee will discourage many from using the network so as to decongest the server.There should be alternatives to these motives for general adoption. I researched that on a Monday (one day), the total value of all transaction fees paid to miners hit an astronomical sum above $11 million on that one day, according to Blockchain.com data.If this issue is been addressed, bitcoin will prevail. The fee is deterring the adoption especially in our rural and local areas.This tra<rest of post truncated>

Small holders can use lightning network. You can get those lightning network apps that already set up a channel for you. There are many of them that have good reputation. You do not have to use one of them, you can use three or more of them. Exchanges have total control of your coins and the exchange can be hacked. Also the exchange wallet may be under maintenance and in a way you will not be able to use your coin when you supposed to use it.

### Reply 2:
It is true that Bitcoin fees are considered a problem for adoption, but it is a problem that has solutions and has been discussed a lot. If your transactions are rare and for large amounts, wait until the fees are reasonable and then broadcast your transactions. However, if you use Bitcoin on an almost daily basis, use the Lightning Network.If you have not already opened your channel, use <link>

Topic: Mexico is the next El Salvador?
### Original post:
We all know that El Salvador is already using Bitcoin as legal tender officially and there is already a lot of good feedback from it, there are already some people visiting or migrating to El Salvador because of Bitcoin being a legal tender, but on the other hand, there are still some people criticizing it and talking negative things about El Salvador's decision.So now, Mexico seems started to take a look at this case too, using Bitcoin as a legal tender in their country.Mexico got 128million population right now and El Salvador got around 7 million population according to Google.It seems this will be a very big win for the Bitcoin community once will be implemented.What are your thoughts about this?

### Reply 1:
Yes, it is possible. Bitcoin is virtual but has a monetary value which means users can freely send money to each other without dealing with exorbitant fees and without the need for a bank account. As technology advances, so does its capacity to meet our needs. This can be seen through the rise of bitcoin.Bitcoin is slowly but surely penetrating the global economy, and in our modern world, it is a currency that generates less friction than fiat currencies. This is definitely worth a look for those who are interested in such things including Mexico and in my opinion using bitcoin is safer and just as easy in other words a new way for people to send money quickly and securely to each other around the world.

### Reply 2:
So if one Mexican senator(who happens to be pro-Bitcoin) says that Bitcoin will become legal tender in Mexico this automatically means that Bitcoin will become legal tender in Mexico. It doesn't work that way. What if a US congressman or senator says that Bitcoin will become legal tender in the USA? Would you believe this news? I wouldn't.I don't know anything about the financial situation in Mexico, but I don't believe that Mexico isn't a worst financial condition than El Salvador or Venezuela. I also don't think that the Mexicans are so desperate that they would embrace Bitcoin/altcoins right away.

Topic: Meet The Bolt Card, an NFC-enabled Lightning card
### Original post:
CoinCorner has created an interesting product. A physical card that you can use to tap to pay via lightning in person.This video explains how you can link your card to the CoinCorner app: <link> store that has BTCPayServer can accept payments via NFC, which means they can accept payments with this card, as you can see in this video: <link> can create a giftcard and then just hand them to anyone, who can then receive the sats with any wallet. This is basically a lightning version of the opendime, as you can see in this video: <link> currently selling each card at 4.99(they give you a 50% discount if you are a user of CoinCorner) with a maximum of 21 per customer, and you need to use their app to fund it for use as a debit card. They offer free deposits and withdrawals using lightning.You can also use the card without having an account with CoinCorner:At the end of the day this is just an NFC card with a nice design. You can of course DIY your own service. Here's a video about how to use the card with other service, like ln.cash for example to create the LNURL and then use a generic free Android NFC writer app(NFC Tools) to setup the card: <link>

### Reply 1:
I have some misgivings too. Not really sure about theyre usecase , more of a gimmick I suppose.My main concern is whether any artists have been <truncated> for the use of their art

### Reply 2:
I don't get how the card itself can be used for Lightning payments. I don't think that people would pull out a random custodial app just to make LN payments to stuff such as BTCPayServer stores.Maybe it's just me, but what good are all these crypto-backed cards if they cannot be used to make crypto payments.Let's face something, a basic truth. The majority of people will always have a card. That's not going to change any time soon. So the only way all these crypto-backed cards can be useful for anything is if the payment networks can automatically relay those payments towards the corresponding wallet custodian, which then relays the payment to the corresponding blockchain (since we all know that the big payment networks would never agree to such a co-operation). Something like this:Card -> Payment processor (e.g. Visa) -> Wallet Custodian (receives fiat funds) -> broadcasts corresponding transaction to LN on behalf of user.This is necessary to achieve ubiquiticy [not sure if that's a word] of payments using crypto under the hood, a necessary step to global adoption of crypto as a payment network.

Topic: Multisig methods don't need multisig bitcoin to prevent thefts
### Original post:
People are talking about multisig support as if it would have prevented the recent thefts. It probably would have; but it would be nothing to do with multisig. That same security is (mostly) already available.Here's what Gavin said in the Ars Technica article:In other words: a second secure machine is needed to approve a transaction. Let's say it's as simple as a message popping up on your mobile phone saying ""approve the following withdrawals"". In multisig, answering ""yes"" would sign the transaction with the second private key. That would definitely be great. However, what is to stop the single current signature required being obtained in the same way it will be in this multisig world?No private key stored on the ""hot"" wallet; the mobile phone app stores the private key and signs on demand with approval from the owner. Now imagine that that app was in Zhou or slush's pocket.This is not to say there aren't additional advantages to multisig (prevention of damage on theft of mobile phone being one), but the above would have prevented the thefts without needing multisig support to be ready.There are already people doing this: BCCAPI as used by BitcoinSpinner, Electrum, StrongCoin, Blo<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
With multisig, will it not be possible to have two independent servers, where each of them can sign a transaction, but checks that it makes sense first? This is a solution which is both fully automated and more secure than keeping keys on a single server, even if encrypted.Also there could be a multi-tiered approach. The hot server will have a small amount of coins for immediate use, requiring just local keys. In addition a larger amount of coins will be in a 2-of-2 address with keys in the hot server and a lukewarm server (which is more secure than just a key in the lukewarm server). If the hot server is close to running out, he polls the lukewarm server to send it some coins, which it will agree to only if the transaction makes sense, is in a limited amount, and it notifies the operator. This obviates the need for manual intervention in each and every transfer, while still offering damage control.

### Reply 2:
I suppose; but if they've got root access then installing a handy ""/usr/bin/read"" that emails them everything that is sent wouldn't be too hard.The key part of the protection is that it's done by another system.

### Original post:
As a large exchange and currently the most popular crypto exchange, Binance announced that it will provide or facilitate Bitcoin miners with a nominal value of $500 million and will be awarded to Public Bitcoin mining companies and Private Bitcoin Mining and digital asset infrastructure globally.In its announcement a few days ago Binance will seriously support the mining industry and will also look for cloud mining vendors.This plan emerged when Bitcoin Miners had a difficult moment in recent months and the bitcoin price continued to fall to touch -72% of the previous ATH. Of course, this year has been an unfavorable year for miners, while electricity costs and maintenance costs continue and are increasingly expensive.data from: <link> to data from The Block Research, Bitcoin Miner revenue continues to decline from its highest in November 2021 with revenue of $1.7 billion and to date in September Miner earns $550 million in revenue and that's down about 67.7%, which is definitely a huge drop. and the loss of miners is also caused by a decrease in the price of bitcoin.And as a solution for Bitcoin miners who had experienced losses, Binance Pool as one of the world's leading crypto m<rest of post truncated>

Because if you are running an unprofitable business, the best possible thing to do is to lock up your assets for 2 years to take out a loan at 10% so you can continue to run your unprofitable business and end up even more in debt than you were to begin with. Don't be fooled in to thinking this is Binance doing something good for the network. It isn't. This is Binance doing whatever they can to make more profit for themselves, at the expense of anyone and anything else. Just as they have always done.The last retarget saw the difficulty increase by one of the highest jumps ever, and the highest since May last year. We are on track for another 5% jump in this period. Hashrate is at its highest ever, and continuing to grow. The ecosystem is ""running and growing"" just fine, without this cash grab from Binance.

### Reply 2:
The already low block reward and the steadily falling prices have put a lot of miners out of business, but whether the loan will bring back the miners' confidence to rebuild their bitcoin mining, I think why binance didn't build it for themselves, because we know they own the market the world's largest cryptocurrency and binance can build the world's largest bitcoin mine too

Topic: 90% of bitcoin is owned by 2% of user base
### Original post:
Price discovery is impossible with the whales controlling 90% of all bitcoins minted. The original intent of bitcoin as a neutral asset disappeared long ago. Those at the top are trying to get more users in to keep it's price (and their investment) stabilized. Bitcoin kind of reminds me of the push for solar energy to replace engines using fossil fuels. Big marketing push by those who benefit from it's adoption even though it doesn't have the value advertised.Two 1.5 hour videos on the subject on streaming TV interviewing early adopters and investors who have made and lost money.

### Reply 1:
It would be nice if you share the source where did you find only 2% of a circulation controlled by normal users and 90% controlled by whales? I haven't seen such news anywhere. So I am curious to know more. Don't forget Bitcoin is a truly decentralized cryptocurrency. Anyone can accumulate whatever they want by availability. Not a centralized that can mint whatever they want. Regarding loss and profits, it's a highly volatile cryptocurrency, so people take advantage. Nothing wrong with that.

### Reply 2:
This is a good topic of discussion, but it's quite unfortunate as you weren't able to back up your statements with concrete proof, source, or image which justifies that 90% of Bitcoin is actually owned by 2% of its user base because I and other members of the bitcointalk forum love fact, and we would have been very pleased having you dissect this allegation of yours with facts. However, thou Bitcoin transaction is transparent and can be seen by anyone on its blockchain, I doubt if it is possible to see a hierarchy of users with the highest amount of Bitcoin, as a criterion for you to have come up with this statement of yours.

Topic: We All Know, The halving time will be full of drama
### Original post:
Yes, like the title above, we all know the halving time is will always full of drama, this always happens at that time, but I don't know why many people forget and still spread FUD everywhere. If they understand that and know it always happens on every 4 years, they shall be calm and relaxed to face SEC, Binance, or anything drama. I hope this lesson gives you an important point. They create this to dump Bitcoin, they do this to scare you, they do this to buy Bitcoin at a cheap price, and After buying with a lot of money, you already know that today Bitcoin price is pumped like crazy, right?So, I just want to say; Don't forget, The drama could happen again and repeat until the halving time. you must be strong and patient. you will definitely win if you face it with a quiet and strong hand if happen again in the near future.Cheers

### Reply 1:
The best course of action at the moment is to exercise patience because, as a result of recent news reports about hacks at other exchanges and the SEC, many newcomers to the market are terrified and are selling off their Bitcoin out of panic and FUD. I don't blame them for doing this because they are aware of how long this bear market has lasted.As a Bitcoiner, I have never personally experienced Bitcoin halving; instead, I only hear that the Bitcoin price do go above its all-time high. Since I've learned a lot from this forum and am actively looking for ways to acquire more Bitcoin before the price starts to rise, nothing can make me consider selling my current Bitcoin holdings.

### Reply 2:
It's just FUD in general not necessarily because the halving is around the corner. I'm pretty sure the government could care less about the halving. The FUD recently has mostly been before the spot ETF announcements it's a pretty safe assumption that it's been coordinated.

Topic: Robert F Kennedy Jr a Bitcoin Holder
### Original post:
<link> a recent news, financial records of Robert F Kennedy Jr shows that he is a bitcoin holder, and reported to have own between $100k and $250k worth.And that's why recently you will hear him to be a bitcoin supporter and attacking Biden and his cohorts for being anti-bitcoin or anti-crypto.

### Reply 1:
Probably it's a donation to him and this is not a personal wallet? Not sure though.But I do agree that he was ranting about SEC and Gary Gensler with regards to the stance against bitcoin and the rest of crypto.And there could be political motivation behind, perhaps they can used it to sway young voters on their side because they are into BTC and then telling positive things about it and defending mining as well.

### Reply 2:
I totally agree.Ten years ago this would have been a major news and will help put Bitcoin in the mainstream media, but fast forward to today it's just another lucky person who was able to get some bitcoins and possibly still hold them.I will be willing to place a bet that if the personalities of all Bitcoin holders were public there would be a lot of eyebrow raising names on the list.

Topic: Bitcoin Suisse tram in Zurich, Switzerland
### Original post:
Saw this in Zurich, Switzerland, last Sunday:Nice to see something like this in the real world.

### Reply 1:
I'm pretty sure Zurich and Geneva are the 2 biggest cities in Switzerland anyway. Even if it's just Zurich, that's pretty good exposure, there must be 10's of millions of tourists and other foreigners passing through Zurich every year, many of whom using the trams.

### Reply 2:
That can be a big dream come true if we can see half of all countries of the world giving a good treatment to cryptocurrency, and even if there will just be 20% of them that would be enough to create a sort of snowball for others to get on board. Unfortunately, progress can really be so slow and adoption can be taking time, we can not force people and the governments to come to our viewpoints. We need more time and patience here. One day, I am sure that there will be more and more countries to pattern after Switzerland for that matter.

### Original post:
Tulsi Gabbard US Presidential Candidate OR a BITCOIN LOVER?<link>

### Reply 1:
Ohh that's surprising! I know her since she was elected as the first Hindu member of the US congress and I remember reading a story in my local newspaper about it. But the fact that she is a crypto lover, has come to me as a surprise. But I would not generalize her as a bitcoin lover because I don't see any bitcoin holding in her asset filing, it's only ETH and LTC. But if she gets elected as a ""President"" in 2020, I hope more crypto friendly legislation will be formed in US from its current stringent and confusing state. However, the way people have chosen Trump in the election due to his aggressive stance against many issues, which now lead to a national shutdown, I think people in 2020, will like a calm and positive person like Tulsi. Fingers crossed!

### Reply 2:
Even if she doesn't make it to the whitehouse her campaign is likely to accept bitcoins as a donation currency which is good advertising. Also she might promote it as a solution to the trillions of dollars of debt

Topic: Bitcoin Bank - Safely store your bitcoin
### Original post:
My idea would be to create a bank to safely store people's bitcoin and other crypto for people who just want to hold for a lot of time.They would register with the passport or ID, it would cost 100 GBP + 1% to deposit and verify people's identities.Then, to withdraw, it would take 3 months, they would have to show the passport and have a meeting via zoom once a month during 3 months stating they would want to withdraw, it would cost 300 USD plus 1% of the value.It would compensate for people who want to hold for a lot of time without having security concerns.

### Reply 1:
Own Bitcoin private keys and have your own bank. Not your keys, not your bitcoins.By that, who needs your custodian Bitcoin bank as they will not have keys, not have coins?They can store their bitcoin by themselves, being non-custodian without any service fee, and without KYC.Why KYC is extremely dangerous - and uselessWaiting three months for withdrawal, damn no one will use your service.Being non custodian, people can send their bitcoin permissionless and don't have to wait 3 months like your service.

### Reply 2:
Op I don't need to read everything in your thread. Your caption and the content of your thread is wrong. Op I must tell you, you brought a very wrong idea to the forum and that will not even included in the plan of bitcoin even in the future. Well what you saying is not far from centralized exchanges so you can save your coins in the central exchange platform but remember once you do that the coins will never be your custody again but the owners of the exchange will be in control of your coins. But if you are referring to bitcoin to be saved in bank then lock this thread because that will never happen in any day.

Topic: Speculation will drive the btc ride further as always
### Original post:
Some says there is no use of btc and hence no demand of btc. So no one is buying.Another type of people who wants to see btc sub 7k, so they can buy and make quick profit.But data shows btc is being traded from localbitcoins and dark market widely. In the end, speculation and sentiment will drive the btc ride. On May 2020, btc may exceed 40k.or go sub 6k. Lets wait and ride the btc coaster.

### Reply 1:
It also seems to me that now someone is manipulating the price, such a change is not typical for bitcoin.

### Reply 2:
So, you agree that currently Bitcoin has no real use (in wide area) and what causes the price movement is mostly just speculation?

Topic: About Bitcoin paper notes
### Original post:
I think a bit about this, and I invent a method of using bitcoin notes in close to usual banknotes way.You need 3-th side in this, say <truncated> need to create an account on paperbitcoins.com and preload it with some bitcoins on you'r main wallet.Next you need to create a bills what you need. Say 500 mBTC, 1 BTC, 1 BTC, 2 BTC, 2 BTC, 5 BTC, 10 BTC.Then you got the barcodes, related to this bills. It's not bitcoin keys, it's <truncated> codes.Then you need to print the notes like thisin my example it will be 7 notes with nominals 0.5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 5 and 10 BTC. Probably you need to use a different colors for different face value for usability reasons, but it's not matter. You need you'r barcodes on that notes. Actually paperbitcoins.com can automatically generate for you 7 svg files with you'r notes.Then you need a RSA SecurID token, connected to you account on <truncated> also need the public key from your main wallet for your change. You can paint it on your RSA token for example.Say, you need to pay 2,9 BTC.You find 1 BTC and 2 BTC notes in your wallet and give it, with your RSA token, to the seller.Then the seller scan codes from your notes, enter the authentication code from y<rest of post truncated>

How is this different from banking with a debit card? Except that if the site gets hacked you are SOL?

### Reply 2:
When you banking with a debit card, you have two options:1. rollback payments, and headache for issuer, and increased fees as result, and this is not Bitcoin.2. non rollback payments. And anyone who have or had access to you debit card can stole your money.My grandma can't do that.Many people (in Africa, or India for example) don't have a mobile phone, or have a phone that can't do that job.But if you can, obviously you can use your phone instead of hardware RSA token.

Topic: US Govt file public notification of sale of ~$130 Million in BTC from Silk Road
### Original post:
Today I read the news the govt of USA took a decision to sell approximately $130 million worth of BTC linked to Silk Road forfeitures.Source: fintelegram.comThey are focusing on ongoing legal repercussions which are associated with illegal activities. Those BTC linked to Ryan Farace aka Xanaxman and Sean Bridges both of them are part of a larger effort to combat money laundering and suspicious transactions. Farace and his father Joseph, who were convicted of conspiracy to commit money laundering, and they tried to transfer a vast sum of BTC to an overseas account.US governments investigation team found a hidden connection to Bridges, who is a former Secret Service agent involved in the Silk Road investigation, his name adds more complexity to the case. The court ordered them to forfeit their bitcoin, Although Bridges agreed to return the stolen bitcoins to US agents, Farace and his father claimed not to have access to the bitcoins used for darknet transactions, lol..What do you think, how will be the impact of the market, good or bad?looks like they have enough resources to make the bottoms they want.

### Reply 1:
Technically, it's a lot of money but comparing it to the institutions, it's definitely peanuts. If we see the impact of it, there could be a slight move but compared to what the institutions sell-offs and buy orders. There is no doubt that they've got that much. And if the seized one are going to be sold, it is for sure that many would come to take it as it's like cleaned already by the government as it's obviously because it came from them. WHat matters there is the amount of Bitcoin that will be put up on sale.

### Reply 2:
Whatever they sell on the open market or they use OTC that doesn't mater.is $130M a big number?the significant daily sale by Grayscale is amounting to 5x than the so-called $130M sale related to Silk Road forfeitures. Where such consistent large-scale sales from Grayscale struggle to influence potential short-term price movements, $130 million is the equivalent of dust compared to the Grayscale dump!By the way, don't you guys know what is the per-day transaction of Bitcoin?look coinmarketcap, more than ~16 Billion bitcoins are traded every day and we are speculating with their 130M dust LoL...

Topic: Is there a way to combat this mining concentration AND get paid (some question
### Original post:
Andreesen said that one mining pool had veto power over system changes. I don't think that, in itself, is a big deal. I know how to encrypt my wallet. On the other hand, I have no real understanding of what he's talking about.1. Where are the ""rules"" about these large mining pools? I didn't see it in Satoshi's white paper.(please answer!)2. Why does this matter? Does the person who is awarded a block get to ""control"" it forever?3. Instead of some commie a$$ appeal (sorry, I'm and 80s kid) to donate to smaller mining pools (which some of you were making), why can't I loan them to these ""more virtuous"" mining groups and get kicked back some of the discovered blocks, thus receiving a return on my investment - rather than ""DONATING?""If so, could you please such an enterprise!4. Sorry if I sound like an arrogant buffoon that has a Bobby Knight poster on my wall, but I doubt I'm the only one who has the same misconception. I'm buying BTC to try to make $$$ and am ""tech-challenged.""

### Reply 1:
If I loan them money that is intended to steer them to a particular pool, then they have MORE resources to mine with and can receive an incremental profit greater than otherwise and still reimburse me part of the additional profit? Why wouldn't that work? If not, these guys didn't really think through the design all that well.

This patent is for executable QR codes, ie, actual byte-code instructions encoded in a QR code. This doesn't affect Bitcoin or anything else using QR codes for URIs or IDs or any other kind of non-executable data.

It looks way too broad. Anyone using it for bitcoins prior to his filing date would be grandfathered in anyway.

Topic: Why the next Bitcoin halvening could be the most dramatic one yet
### Original post:
Bitcoin, the worlds largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is gearing up for a halving in May 2020. Like any blockchain, Bitcoin must undergo updates. A halving is a form of system update that occurs after 210,000 blocks have been mined. This has happened twice since 2009, most recently in 2016. With one due next year, were taking a look at why the next Bitcoin halving could be the most dramatic one yet. What is a Bitcoin halving? A Bitcoin halving occurs approximately once every 4 years, after 210,000 blocks have been mined by the system. According to eToro a Bitcoin halving means that the rewards that Bitcoin miners receive for validating transactions are reduced by 50%. So, after the last halving event in 2016, the blockchain went from mining 3600 BTC per day to mining 1800 BTC. The Bitcoin halving date scheduled for May 2020, only 900 BTC will be mined a day. This means that the reward for mining is reduced by half. Currently at 12.5 BTC per block, the reward will fall to 6.25 BTC. So, lets take a look at why the next Bitcoin halving could be the most dramatic one yet. <link> Heralding a bull run Historically, Bitcoin bull runs have been linked with halvings.

### Reply 1:
This would be a much waited event and still the most uncertain one.The halving of litecoin showed that a bearish market won't stop the price from rising. But again Bitcoin is a hot topic for investment and with all those leverage trading, whales and exchanges may act in an unpredictable way to make the price much more volatile.

### Reply 2:
In my opinion, the first halving ever was the most dramatic, since it was the first time when the halving code was executed in the live environment. After that, we know that the next halvings will be safe, so there's less uncertainty about the code. What are they smoking?

Topic: Bitcoin isn't dying, it's alive.
### Original post:
We can see the price of Bitcoin is going down gradually but no one wants to understand it depends on your stock market it is also a digital currency through digital transactions and it is currently in bad condition Elon Musk said in 1 reply on Twitter. Bitcoin is as cold as winter you have to wait for this of course bitcoin price may go up at the end of this winter so be patient everyone. So if we all wait and if we all hold on to what we have, it's going to get $30,000 to $40,000 by the middle of the year and get to a very good price and it could get to a hundred if we hold it tight, so everybody's disappointed. Let's save Bitcoin by holding instead.

### Reply 1:
Let's take it from the real sense with real life approach that when we call bitcoin as a volatile currency and still yet what determines this volatility is base on its demand and supply market and it's working perfectly fine according to these as written from the whitepaper and it concensus protocols with blockchain and has never cease from its participation from the role it's expected to olay as a currency over the years, people use it to make purchases of goods and services with bitcoin and has continue to serve as an exchange medium yet being a currency but i wonder some people raising uncertainty alarm whenever it goes dip causing fear, isn't it better to refer them to where it has started from and where we are currently to consider the difference between bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and why bitcoin is the most preferred cryptocurrency on the internet, high volatility or bear moves in bitcoin price does not amount to it failure but rather it pattern to move ahead with time.

### Reply 2:
Yes Bitcoin is truly alive, just look at the volume traded and exchanged. It's the same shit every crypto winter, oh Bitcoin is dead, crypto is finally done and while the FUD is being spread, a lot of these same institutions helping spreading FUD are accumulating. Then once the winter is over, FOMO kicks in hard.

Topic: Bitcoin Operations and Security Standard (BOSS)
### Original post:
If any of us want bitcoin to succeed, we need to achieve the following:Establish security and auditing standards that bitcoin companies and comply with. This can be publicly posted and edited and companies can post a statement of compliance such as: Complies with bitcoin security standard V2.1The goal of this is to ensure bitcoin can self-regulate instead of running to the government and begging to be saved from the bad guys. I'm not anti-government regulations per se, but calling in the government to regulate a brand new industry will most certainly stifle innovation. While there seems to be circumstantial evidence to suggest ZT may have either been a naughty boy or just plain stupid, we need to proceed judiciously. Note that accusations are easy, and tomorrow anyone here with any business could be accused of wrong doing should something go wrong.We need to put in place transparency and self-regulation so that rampant speculation will have no place.The fiat financial world is heavily regulated because they had to learn all their lessons the hard way. We don't need to. We should simply apply the lessons here and make BTC a far better product. For example:V0.1 of Bitcoin Operations <rest of post truncated>

Admit it.. you couldn't wait to use that acronym for SOMETHING

### Reply 2:
My guess is that when presented with a BOSS business and a competing business, the BOSS business will attract more customers. Competition ensures most companies will do the right thing and WANT to attract confidence in their business.If I'm wrong and everyone wants to keep the current state of affairs, then Bitcoin may not be able to compete with the fiat world and will remain a hobby among the few thousand users here.That's most certainly going to happen, but less frequently than without BOSS. And everytime it happens, we can amend BOSS to mitigate the newly identified risk.

Topic: Do you want to be a hero? (maybe not)
### Original post:
A man in Lebanon was hailed a hero after he takes a bank a hostage. And the reason why he did that? it's because he can't withdraw his money from bank. He had a family emergency, so obviously, he needed that money for hospital bills and all his saving is in that bank. And the hostage ended after the negotiators were able to produce $35,000 (29,000) of his savings upfront.<link> don't know if I can good to that length to hostage the bank or something. But one thing is for sure, if people could just learn how to put their money on bitcoin or crypto, in which they have total control, maybe in times of need, you can just transfer some and convert it to fiat anytime you want. You don't need to be a hero.In other news, Video Shows Tanks Protecting Crisis-Hit Banks In China, Internet Says ""History Repeats Itself"".

### Reply 1:
this is one of the questionable request that should be laid on banks requesting why? because many had gone through lots of difficulties in the process of bank restrictions to one's finances, bitcoin is a good opportunity that take away this embargo for real, which has lifted many from the trap and dungeons of centralized system of hostages, with bitcoin there's freedom ones you know how to remain truly decentralized by staying away from centralized exchanges which share similarities in bank especially with KYC related issues. better you stay off their banking system because yours can be different case entirely, once you don't fully depends on banks with your finances then overlooked all their downfalls and embrace bitcoin. preferably bitcoin and not other cryptocurrencies, then the solution is easy and simple, p2p.

### Reply 2:
Putting ones savings into bitcoin? One of the biggest deterrent of this is the volatility of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is highly speculative; someone can have $1000 worth of Bitcoin today which that reduces to $600 in a couple of weeks. An emergency can come up at any time, and if it occurs during a down market, the person may not be able to get the complete funds to save the situation.Secondly, the bank is still a factor here as the person would need to convert back to fiat.If the bank can withhold savings which have been there for a while, they can definitely delay an incoming transaction and restrict the user from cashing it out.Advising people to put their money in ""Bitcoin or crypto"" could lead many to shitcoins; a large amount of altcoins are not worth investing in.

Topic: What your family thinks about that you into crypto
### Original post:
Hello everyone, good morning, yesterday I had a conversation with my family about crypto(BTC if we being specific).Im HODL for a long time now, and really believe that in the end crypto actually do fly to do moon( More about Moon:)my family thinks its a bullshit, and think that im wasting my time and money. I try to explain it countless of times and it seems that is simply imposable for to them to understandSo, im just curious what your family/friends think about it?

### Reply 1:
Never tell your family that you are into crypto. Since I'm from a third world country, money is very important here that your family might be greedy to you for the sake of it. Since my family knows that I'm into crypto, the decisions I make are being hinder by them which forced me to separate ways. It's hard to admit but they only think cryptocurrency as a source of income. Nonetheless, I still support their financial needs.

### Reply 2:
^ When that for a long time? If you are buying around in the year 2017 which bitcoin is very high you should still hold until now but if that last year then, you can get your profit now. Nevertheless, I don't force my family to get involved in crypto if they don't. Just explaining them once but if they did not listen to me, I will not forcing them. But, recently my brother and sisters are now getting in touch with crypto because they saw that I did not worry when it comes to the financial problem. Showing your self that you are improving with crypto they are a spontaneous embrace of what crypto it is.

Topic: Is it a mistake to make a separate Bitcoin channel on YouTube?
### Original post:
I took note of all the various comments in my recent threads, and many thanks for those. I'm planning my YouTube channel at the moment, and it seems to me that a dedicated Bitcoin channel is not a good idea. I very rarely watch them any more, as they seem to be contradictory, and often over complex, and many of them seem to show a lack of understanding of the purpose and technology behind Bitcoin. There seem to be 3 main categories of Bitcoiners ( apart from undecided newbies of course), and these are speculators, businesses and weath protectors. I don't want to target the speculators, as those are either gamblers or highly technical statisticians. My advice to business users is to embrace Bitcoin as an efficient means of international payment, but they may be advised to sell their Bitcoin receipts to avoid losses as a result of its volatility. My target audience is van dwellers, and others living offgrid, and who are considering Bitcoin as a form of saving and wealth protection.So, should I accept that Bitcoin has now become an established medium of exchange and savings, and just include videos about it in a general offgrid camper channel? The alternative would be to create a dedi<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
You said it yourself, your target audience are van dwellers, so your first proposal works the best in my opinion. Making a separate channel isn't a mistake though, it's just that you have to work double your normal workload to pump out videos for your van dweller videos which I think is nice given that nomadic lifestyle is gaining traction right now and then you have another channel that's totally different, so it's on you. If you don't mind the workload then create a separate channel but if not then stick to your first choice. Good luck with your channel.

### Reply 2:
It is very important to include all the necessary infrastructural materials that talks about bitcoin all in your package, meanwhile what will make it more outstanding is the headlights on the headline which gives opportunity to draw the attention of people, i know some would prefer the use of YouTube channels for visual learning that in reading articles but the whole thing must be simple and captivating as well.This as well is not a bad idea because you will need some extra effort to make edge over your competitors who have similar channels created, this is where the role of bloggers set in and it will five you more advantage to get more clicks if you're able to make use of the role the bloggers could perform all by yourself or employing someone for it.

Topic: How Bitcoin Distribution Is a Bullish Sign For Greater Adoption

There are a number of differing metrics analysts use to determine the health of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Hash rate and transactions are two of the most popular but distribution in terms of the number of addresses can also be used to determine adoption rates.Bitcoin Addresses IncreasingOver the past two years the number of BTC addresses has surged indicating that the asset is undergoing greater adoption. The largest gain is the number of addresses with less than a million satoshis which also suggests a more even distribution that is not just a few whales or large exchanges.According to director of research at The Block, Larry Cermak, this is a very bullish metric.This is probably the most bullish chart on Bitcoin Ive seen to date. Even though a single person can own multiple addresses, this to me clearly indicates user growth and an improving distribution.This is probably the most bullish chart on Bitcoin Ive seen to date.

### Reply 1:
though the number of UTXO's can indicate something. it also has to be taken into context, other things like the richlist of the largest hoards can prove indicative aswell.. the more coins held in large addresses indicates lots of coins in exchanges which if at a extreme level is usaully a sign people are ready to sell, indicating a bearish trendwhich means when less funds are hoarded by exchanges and more is hoarded individually then there is less available in exchanges which would indicate a stronger bull signaland ofcourse there is the mining costs. if there is not much profit in mining then the speculation buffer is thin which means good value to buy. again adding to a bull signal. where as if the mining costs were low but price was high then people are happy to sell, indicating a bear signal.

### Reply 2:
Well, as they are saying, the more the merrier and in the case of Bitcoin the more users there are the better it would be as far as adoption is concerned. One thing for sure is the significant growth in Bitcoin addresses taking into consideration its limitations can mean a lot and can be used as a signal for something that can be happening soon. This can be real growth that we are all dreaming about. How this can be influencing and translating into numbers in the price of Bitcoin is something worth looking forward to.

### Original post:
Sorry if this question has been addressed somewhere... but I couldn't find it.It's my understanding that anyone who gains access to my wallet.dat file... basically has ""the keys to the kingdom"". He has all of my money.That means that backing up my wallet.dat file is important. But it also means that every backup I make, is one more copy that could fall into the wrong hands. No? Kind of like making multiple copies of my house keys...?What's the best practice with securing the safety of your wallet.dat file?Also, couldn't there be encryption of my wallet.dat file built-in to the bitcoin app. In other words, upon launch, I am prompted to enter a password. That password un-encrypts my wallet.dat file. Later, when I close the app, it is automatically encrypted again. This way, I could make a zillion backup copies of the file... without worry... because no one could actually use it without the un-encryption password.No?Could PGP encryption of the wallet.dat file be built-in to the app?I apologize that I'm talking over my head, technology-wise...

well, if you're savvy with pgp or truecrypt, you could do your encryption yourself.that said, i don't think it's a bad idea to have the option to store the wallet as an encrypted file which requires a passphrase upon every bitcoin start, etc. that way the file is 'encrypted by default', which is not a bad place to be.

### Reply 2:
Poor argument. Not all people can be an experts in safety. Why not to help people with transparent encryption of wallet.dat? It should improve security a lot. It can be quite easy, idea is the same as for private keys in GPG. File itself is encrypted with master password and when people want to make a transaction, application ask for password. Maybe there can be short password cache. With this simple thing wallet.dat is almost unusable for other people.Do you think it is easy? Say it to my mum.But UNIX like system never became a mainstream. With this attitude, bitcoin never became mainstream too, because it will be too difficult to be safe. Imagine that many small companies have its 20 computers on the same LAN, with Windows sharing 'on'. Will people believe in bitcoin anymore after somebody will steal it's wallet.dat from their computers?I fully accept idea of bitcoin, but currently it is still game for a geeks. If we can take it seriously, we have to make it user friendly as much as possible. Answer that 'something does not belong to bitcoin core' will fail. It is also reason why I'd like to see exact specification of bitcoin protocol. Then there can be both simple clients for ge<rest of post truncated>

Topic: Black Rock Influence
### Original post:
From my research I found out a stat might not be accurate all corrections are welcomedBlack Rock currently own 70,000BTC worth of Bitcoins 70,000 Btcs worths: 70,000 * $43,000(at average) =$2.9B+as theworld largest asset managerWith this kind of worth could they massively influence the BTC market??Probably any time they want..Edit : stats

### Reply 1:
I think we're all having different stats cause...According to my research, they own over 118.585 Billion dollars. Not sure if that's their worth of Bitcoin though...but It can't be over 11,439 BTC worth.But the main question to answer here would be if they can influence bitcoin market. I'd say, being the largest asset manager, they should have a small chance of doing that. And that chance would be the capacity to attract other investors and have a good impact on the legitimacy and adoption of Bitcoin as they specialize in alternative investments.

### Reply 2:
They can manipulate the market through massive Bitcoin sales, just like GrayScale did recently. But we expect they to have this heavy influence only on short run, because once they manipulate the market once, they are going to lose the resources to do it again in the future, unless they purchase the coins again when the price hits the bottom.That is why average independent investors should take advantage of such manipulative events to buy Bitcoin cheaper and take the coins from the hands of the whales of this industry, so their power decreases as Bitcoin becomes splitted among more different investors' hands, decreasing the potential of future manipulations happening in crypto market, at least in big proportion.About Black Rock, only now people are starting to talk about it more frequently. They not only own huge sums of BTC, but also large positions in titan global companies like Google, NVIDIA, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Disney.

Topic: Let's Discuss ""Give a Goat""
### Original post:
This thread will have nothing to do with the fine efforts put forward by CoinLab, Heifer Internatinal, OXFAM, or any other entity that currently utilizes a 'Give a Goat' program.Together, let's explore if there's a better way to accomplish the same feat but on the local level incorporating Bitcoin. I'll present a brief outline, whereupon the pros and cons of such an endeavor will be discussed.From what I've read, the 'Give a Goat' program is available on all six continents, not just to a handful of African nations one may expect. And, for the most part, small villages and remote rural areas are the norm as to the location of the recipients whom receive the goats. Thus, it's safe to assume that the main suppliers of the goats are also local, for it wouldn't make sense to truck in the goats from afar.The goat suppliers are definitely a for-profit entity, receiving prevailing compensation for their goats paid via the charitable entities, possibly at the lowest possible price point.Enter Bitcoin. What if a charitable organization worked in concert only with the goat supplier? Surely the price of a goat is well cheaper than $50 USD in the most famish regions, possibly in the 20-30 dolla<rest of post truncated>

It has been 12 years since Satoshi disappeared on December 12, 2010.Now, it seems to have become something quite different from what he originally set out to do, doesn't it ?I want to hear ""How did you see the development of Bitcoin at that time ?And how do you all feel about the current situation, which is far from the ""pure"" world that he aimed for ?""

### Reply 2:
It's really been a long run for Bitcoin and there's a high tendency that this technology would be 'here' for more years as our technology advances. But to answer the question if it is a failed project, it depends on your view point. If you view it as a mode of payment, then this technology still is so young because many countries are still not supporting the usage of this currency. But on investors' viewpoint, it is successful for having a 'continuous' growth in its price over years which makes it still a good option as an asset even if its market value is too volatile. As more countries adapt to this technology, we would more likely see growth on how this currency will be acknoledged by more people.

Topic: The Demise of BitPak
### Original post:
The Demise of BitPakAbout three weeks ago, I received notification that BitPak, the first Bitcoin wallet for iOS, had been removed from the Apple App store. I had not been given any reason why, just a simple electronic notification that it had been done. I was traveling at the time, and did not have the time to contact Apple to inquire about this.About a week later, someone from Apple called me on the phone to let me know that BitPak had been removed from the App Store. The guy on the phone sounded like a nervous teenager. I asked him why this had happened, and he said ""Because that Bitcoin thing is not legal in all jurisdictions for which BitPak is for sale"". I inquired as to which jurisdictions Bitcoin was deemed to be illlegal in, and he told me ""that is up to you to figure out"". I asked him which laws Bitcoin violated, and again, he replied that ""that is up to you to determine"". I told the kid on the phone that he has in fact told me nothing and was most unhelpful. Unfortunately, my other business ventures are taking up all of my time and resources, and this I no longer have the time to deal with this. I would have continued BitPak development had the app stayed in the store, b<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
You should have told him you have determined it violated no laws, and that it's up to them to prove it violates a law, since they are the one removing the app.But anyway, it's Apple, what would you expect?

Was it hosting the block chain in the app? Maybe AT&T and Verizon said get rid of it because of data or something.

Topic: The vast majority of Bitcoin-based investments aren't good enough.
### Original post:
The beauty of a market with a sound currency is that businesses have to keep up with wealth stored in the main-accepted currency. If they don't, they fail because it would be more profitable to just hold money. People say this is a bad thing and people should be forced to invest in business, even with the given risk of investing in poorly-managed operations. The fact of the matter is that it is clear an economy based on sound currency is going to encourage more efficient, hardier businesses as opposed to one where money cannot be saved and invested when the time is right. In essence, allowing people to suffer a huge loss in opportunity cost just gives people more incentive to invest better, spend better and overall live better. Consequences are more potent. Money is held accountable. Losses hurt more.Why would a system of where waste and destruction can be taken with easy, make society any stronger e.g. an inflationary economy? How can more businesses failing left-and-right, buildings left vacant and people left bankrupt build anything except move things around in a zero-sum game? Why shouldn't economies based on a deflating currency be the way of the future? Is it bad that people <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
At the very least, it will eventually stop being inflationary.

### Reply 2:
They aren't good enough to profit by selling to a global economy, true. But it's important to realize that the Bitcoin economy is larger than just the investments denominated in Bitcoins, and the mere existence of Bitcoin enables this larger economy to profit from investments that do not, nominally, keep up with the rate of growth of Bitcoin itself.

<link> believe that) odds are that Bitcoin based companies will succeed, and perhaps some will be backed by VC money.What kind of Bitcoin company is mostly likely to score an investment round by a VC? An e-wallet? Social site with integrated Bitcoin features? A B2B2C company?(Of course that if this happens the value of Bitcoin will either skyrocket just because of this investment, or will have already skyrockted prior to the investment)

### Reply 1:
It will be something new. Maybe it will be a micropayment or sms based mobile payment system. Due to bitcoin phobia in the USA, it will probably be China or some other country that attracts VC investment.

### Reply 2:
I'm also aware of several other Bitcoin centric companies that have raised substantial amounts of venture capital.

Topic: Excessive Bitcoin fees
### Original post:
What will happen when only large institutions can afford to use Bitcoin's blockchain, due to rising fees? Won't this centralize the network if most can only trade bitcoin on centralized exchanges?

### Reply 1:
I'm a bit confused about what you trying to say but Bitcoin will never become centralized because Satoshi made Bitcoin for decentralization. If the fees are rising it's just temporary there is something going on that is why you see transaction fees rise just like today because the price touched above $50k that is why people right now panic to move their BTC to the exchange before it drops and make a profit.

### Reply 2:
I guess bitcoin developers will not let it get to that point. Also there are layer 2 solutions like lightning network and liquid network. Bitcoin network to become centralized has nothing to do with the transaction fee. You can hold small amount using lightning network or liquid network and hold huge amount on the blockchain.

Crypto mining firm Core Scientific sold over 7,000 Bitcoin in June via the open market to bring its holdings down to about 70% over the previous month.The US-based company said in a public statement on Tuesday that it had roughly raised around $167 million after selling 7,202 BTC at an average price of $23,000. The firm was left with 1,959 BTC and $132 million in cash as of Jun 30 a drop from 8,058 BTC holdings compared to its 31st May filings.Core Scientific mainly used the proceeds from the sale for ASCI server maintenance, debt repayments, and investments in additional data-center capacity. The company hopes to continue selling BTC gained through mining operations to further fund operations, maintain liquidity, and reduce debts.CEO Mike Levitt said in a statement:Our industry is enduring tremendous stress as capital markets have weakened, interest rates are rising and the economy deals with historic inflation.He added:We are working to strengthen our balance sheet and enhance liquidity to meet this challenging environment, and continue to believe that we will be operating in excess of 30 EH/s in our data centers by year-end 2022.The firm was able to generate 1,106 Bitcoin in Jun<rest of post truncated>

It's neither, they are a public company and they are required to give out this information.Since we don't know how many of the large private farms operate we really can't tell how many operations of this size are doing what.It really is more a data-point then anything else.7kBTC and $167 Million over 30 days is about as important a fact towards the market as Dave was out of the good coffee this morning and is drinking some really old stuff.70kBTC and $1.7 Billion may move the needle a bit more, but 7k not that big a deal.-Dave

Topic: Would Bitcoin Be Badly Hurt if Binance Goes Down?
### Original post:
I really am no fan of Binance because I found their KYC annoying. What is not in doubt is that CZ is supposedly one of the most credible faces of crypto. How much harm do you think a Binance implosion would cause Bitcoin? Is the US a big threat to the coin market?<link>

### Reply 1:
Whether you like it or not, it's always a yes. Smaller hacked or shutdown exchanges always give a bad effect on the market, how much more on largest exchange?Shutting down of binance is highly unlikely to happen (for now) maybe on their US based offices/market, but it doesn't speak the same on the rest of their offices/market. But obviously it will have a mid to high bad effect on the market for some time.

### Reply 2:
Binance implosion will really go a long way to affect the market of bitcoin but nothing is new to the cryptocurrency market again after other big incidents occurred and bitcoin is still standing firm and still continue to exist. CZ is a big name in crypto and also his exchange Binance also plays a vital role in the crypto market because of the large amount of bitcoin they hold in their possession. If anything happens to Binance, especially coming from the US government, the market will definitely be affected and we may witness some changes in the market for the time being. After a while, the market will regain its former status but this situation only affects those that their minds are not set into the market yet but are on alert when a negative news pose threat to the market. They panic to sell or withdraw their funds.

Some even said that bitcoin market is matured already that this bull run trends may not become possible by 2024. But the good news is, you should still believe in bitcoin, it will not disappoint you in the next cycle.According to Ontario Securities Commission head, the chief executive officer, Grant Vingoe, he said that they know from their research that 30% of Canadians are willing to invest in crypto asset by 2024.I believe if this kind of research is conducted in many other countries, more people will want to invest in crypto by 2024. And what should we expect by that time and 2025? Bull run.

### Reply 1:
Even if this data is totally accurate, who's to say that they wouldn't change their mind? I could almost guarantee a huge majority of people who bought into the bitcoin hype at near all-time highs were also planning on holding. But yet? Most of them panic sold.

### Reply 2:
You are right, some people would have been holding by now. There would be some bull and bear market before 2024. But I am only saying that time investment would likely be huge which will drive bitcoin to all-time-high.If it turns out as planned, there won't be bull market by early 2024. Even if bull market started it, it won't yet be significant. It would be a good time to hold if invested early before halving. I so much believe in 2024 halving to drive bitcoin to all-time-high.

Topic: Sensitivities of Bitcoin secret hunters.
### Original post:
Most importantly in private and security situations pertaining your Bitcoin holding, trust no one and don't be so relaxed with the family that they would never betray you.Just in I traveled to my place of origin and so also other relatives who lives apart came in too due to a family emergency occurance that everyone has to be present.At our arrival in the central family from different destinations, it was actually a great and happy moment being around seeing ourselves because we all have not come together like that for long now.At some point a cousin said to me that... Let me see your beautiful phone so I gave it to him, then I watched to see what he was doing in the phone. I found out he was trying to penetrate on my wallets but unlucky for him that they are all on passwords and at his notice that I am being observant, he began to point out those wallet Apps in my phone that... What App is this and this and this? What is it used for? And suspiciously, he was only after knowing what my wallets Apps are such as the Binance exchange, Ethereum and what I uses them for.Then I told him some of them are system App which I don't even know about their importance and usage in the phone whic<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
I just want to ask, is your cousin a kid or a young person? If it's the latter, then you've done well. It's not safe to trust anyone with your phone.It's usually recommended to secure your personal apps on your devices using passwords or other security features. This is to prevent others from accessing your private information. I never let anyone access my mobile phone for any reason. All my mobile wallets, exchanges, or any app that accesses my funds are hidden on my phone, and only I know where they are.Besides being a Bitcoin user, your phone often contains a lot of important data. If it's accessed by someone else, you could be at risk of theft or losing your funds or information. I've heard of situations where people's phones were accessed without permission, even when the person claimed to be making calls or watching movies as a friend or family member.So my best advice would be not to give out your device where you access your funds, or hide them on your device in a way that only you can access.It's not his fault. The forums server seems to be experiencing some technical difficulty and at this point is slow. So maybe op might have clicked the post button several times. So it'<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 2:
It is unfortunate that you have been exposed to such a situation, but it is better to store your cryptocurrencies in a cold storage wallet and for the wallets on your phone to be watch-only, with some balance in other wallets for emergency purposes.You must also choose the password so that it is unique and cannot be known by anyone, and avoid storing it digitally or in a place that is easy for others to access. If you are in a shared house, it is better to have a Multisig wallets where you leave one of the seeds in your house, and the other two in a safe and separate place.I almost did the same thing, but I decided to open a new tab before refreshing the page and found that the post had already been posted.

Topic: Investment risks of holding bitcoins
### Original post:
Hi,I have been reading quite a while regarding bitcoins, and I keep reading that one advantage of using bitcoins, as opposed to traditional electronic money such as e-gold, is that the government can't shut it down, being a de-centralized, peer to peer network.I though of different objections:1) Since you can't spend bitcoins to buy food at the grocery (the same way you can't use euros to buy food at at US store, you must first sell euros in exchange of dollars), you need bitcoin-dollar exchanges - and those are centralized organization that the government can shut down.What government can do too, is forbit payments from credit card companies to those organizations, so it become very hard to be able to sell bitcoins for dollars.2) Even though it's true that government can never entirely shutdown bitcoin, the same way that it can't entirely eliminate bit-torrent and peer to peer networks, it not necessary to completely eliminate the bitcoin network in order to destroy the monetary value of the bitcoin.Basically, if the bitcoin network were to be banned, or bitcoin exchanges were to be banned, people would have to go to the black market to exchange bitcoins for dollars, which would b<rest of post truncated>

e-gold was destroyed on money laundering charges by the DOJ.bitcoin network and exchanges clearly violates money laundering regulations as well.And that's only 1 thing.I'm not saying those laws are good, but you have to be very naive not to be aware of them, and the risk they pose to bitcoin speculators and investors.

Re-invest again on Bitcoin and other altcoins. I have business that gave me profit sufficient to sustain my daily expenses and cover all other fix expenses such as monthly bills from insurance, water, electricity and so on. All my crypto holdings is just for my investment venture outside my business.I established my business through taking profit on previous bull run. I mention this because some newbie might be inspired of having their own business using crypto profit and use the profit later on for crypto investment instead of investing purely on Bitcoin without any consistent source of income aside from your job. Right now, Im employed on my own business which gives me a lot of freedom to do what I like while still invested on Bitcoin.

### Reply 2:
When you take profit, you can choose to convert it to stable coins or fiat currency but stable coins have some risk.First risk is, it can be frozen in your wallet.PSA: Most Stablecoins Can Be Frozen, Even in Your Own WalletsSecond risk is it can be depegged. With fiat currency, it does not degeg to itself.If you worry about decreasing purchasing power of your national fiat currency, take profit and convert it to US. dollar.

They're not encrypted, and there's no authentication, so you shouldn't send to an IP over the Internet.

Time has passed, but this practice remained. The methods are various, including direct taxes, indirect taxes, inflation, censoring access to information, indictments, prohibition, slavery, unfair trials, collecting personal information and using it against honest people. However, all these lead to the same supreme goal: the power has to stay in the hands of the elites, while the poor has to work for the benefit of the elites. People fought back, but empty handed most of the times. This epic battle which lasts since ancient times is best described by Murray Rothbard as ""the great conflict which is eternally waged between Liberty and Power"".One way for obtaining freedom and liberty was through private money, but governs don't agree with such competition.

I exchange bitcoins to euro 200,000 euro and then 100,000 euro to usd and recive 105,000 usd.

Topic: A quick reminder from Eric Adams, mayor of the City of New York.
### Original post:
Hey folks, Bitcoin is coming down, hitting a certain price never before seen in probably 90 days. I know that's not really bothersome. We've been in countless similar situations in the past. But we know others are probably troubled when Bitcoin is losing almost 40% from its ATH price. The fear level has risen. As a matter of fact, extreme fear is being recorded for the last couple of days.[1] Perhaps a reminder from the mayor of New York City could help ease the fear. Take note that this is the man who promised to take his first 3 paychecks in Bitcoin as mayor. When asked if he had received his paycheck in Bitcoin already, and was told that the price of Bitcoin has come down, he simply laughed it off saying, ""Well, you know what, sometimes the best time to buy is when things come down so when you go back up you've made a good profit...""[2]So, there you go, as simple as that; these are buying days, folks! Let's all enjoy the bargain sale![1] <link> <link>

### Reply 1:
By the looks of it, he hesitates to say Yes. But it's good to know he has yet not received his first check or he'd lose some money already. In the past 12 years, history kept repeating itself. The downtrend is always going to be temporary.It'd be tragic to see more panic when that happens. But I'm sure there will be a lot of traders here happy to buy at a low price including the mayor.

### Reply 2:
Oh yeah, the bargain sale has come like a Christmas gift for all of us. Im not surprised at all with the prices going down. Pick up the history chapter from any year and you will see that at the beginning of any year the crypto would be bathing in red and making its way to ATL (All to Low) of that year or marginal space. This is an immensely great opportunity for all of us to bag more coins. I salute to the Mayor that he is sticking to his words and also motivating all of us that he is still positive no matter how much the price has dropped for the bitcoin.

Topic: My Past nine months bitcoin journey
### Original post:
I am away from my home working in an office and it is hard to manage both work and house at the same time for me as i came late from office. So most of the time I order food online say 3-4 times in week and was happy with that until the point i realised that i was wasting lot of money on junk food. So i decided to have my future plans as i was already investing in bitcoin so i decided to reduce my weekly budget for ordering online food and decided to invest that money into bitcoin despite the prices and just go on investing till the time being. But i made a plan that every time i would add on the fixed budget of $10 extra to btc investment and from next month increased my intial investment by $10 also.For example say my weekly budget or food expenditure was $40-$50 weekly on my 3-4 order i would reduce it to half and say invest $25 weekly and next week it would be turned to $35.Along with this I was also planning to buy some gaming stuff for my time pass but i dropped that idea for the same reason and decided that i would keep on investing in bitcoin only not any other altcoin also .So this was my plan and investment was done every week.1st Month InvestmentsWeek Investment Bitcoin <rest of post truncated>

Congrats! You'll make it a habit if you keep this up. I hope you get a raise or have a side job since you're increasing your BTC investment per month. You cannot keep on reducing your food budget can you?Have you explored blockchain games with ""play to earn"" feature? Rewards are in altcoins but you can always trade them.

### Reply 2:
If investment is your goal, then the price drop from month to month doesn't matter even if it's an advantage, because holding in the future is the real goal, one that will make you feel at a loss. without looking at the price

Topic: will KYC laws permanently stifle bitcoin?
### Original post:
Even though we do not officially advocate ""asset concealment"" using bitcoin, I feel like many of us deep down like bitcoin for its potential in that arena. Personally, I would love to have a bitcoin debit card, complete with the near universal acceptance of visa/mastercard. I would be able to change the bitcoin address associated with this debit card whenever I want.I am in the camp of people who feel that real world local prices will continue to be listed and paid for in the dominant local currency (whether it be USD or sea shells), not bitcoin. Therefore, I tend to think that bitcoin's success is dependent upon the ability for a bitcoin user to transfer in/out of his local currency. Unfortunately it is this transfer process that triggers the KYC and money exchange laws. And further, once those laws are properly adhered to, I feel like most of the advantages of bitcoin disappear (anonymity being paramount).There are some incredibly bright people in this group. I'm wondering if we can have an ""thought experiment"" about how we could transcend the KYC laws, yet still offer functioning debit cards? Is this even possible?I hate to say it, but I feel like unless bitcoin can be safely an<rest of post truncated>

Sorry, I reread my post and it may have not made much sense. I know that it is no threat to bitcoins directly, and it is possible for a third party to do these things. Let me try to rephrase. I feel most current holders of bitcoin hold them precisely because they can be anonymous. If a bank comes in and offers ""credibility"" to bitcoin at the price of the your privacy, I don't think that bank would get much business from us. You may say, ""well, there are people that use bitcoin who don't care about anonymity and they would like to have a bank like that."" However, my point is that the people who don't care about anonymity and plan to bend over and expose themselves to government scrutiny anyway would rather do it in an easier manner...by just using their government's <truncated> I feel like bitcoin is in a catch-22. Expansion ultimately triggers the KYC laws, but the KYC laws turn off most of bitcoins current user base. People who are not turned off by KYC would probably just rather use alternative investment vehicles.Perhaps a new business model is required to better protect our exchangers. Otherwise the community is just going to keep playing monopoly with itself, because the risk <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 2:
It's literally impossible to assume that any particular feature of Bitcoin is an overwelming reason for adoption. It is more likely that, even among the early adopters such as this forum represents, the *potiential* for anonimity is a bonus but not a critical point. In most of any person's transactions, anominity is irrelevent. Take those FRN for example, I am as anonymous as I choose to be whenever I buy groceries in cash, since the only other party involved is Kroger, and they have no reason to care who I am. However, anominity for such a casual transaction isn't critical. This is the case for most Bitcoin transactions as well, and will continue to be so forever. It's the potential that, should one desire, one could remain anonymous in a particular transaction. The choice to forgo (some) privacy in return for convience is one that everyone makes, but the important part is that it remains a choice. It will, even if BitBanks become a dominate form of institution within the Bitcoin economy. I doubt that they will, and if they do it will be a limited form of banking; likely restricted by reason of free market forces to a single city. Such banks would be unlikely to share customers' i<rest of post truncated>

Topic: WHEN WAS YOUR WORST MOMENT AND CHALLENGE WITH BITCOIN ?
### Original post:
I believe everyone here onboard this platform once had a very though and challenging moment with bitcoin at the initial start. At first it seems unrealistic then looks like a scam but at last it was a real deal. sharing our experiences and worst moment might just help others build on and also bring us back to the very first beginning of our journey into bitcoin then. This would also help us evaluate how far we have gone and also creates room for more on-boarding of more adopters. Sharing our experiences on how we started would also encourage more to be steadfast in the system. This would go a long way in helping others at the verge of giving up on bitcoin.How was your worst moment and experience like and how were you able to handle it then ?

### Reply 1:
My worst moment was after the bull run way back 2017. I managed to buy myself a personal computer during that time while studying in college from doing different crypto-related tasks. I was already planning to give some to my parents the next year of that since I have nothing to spend on after I bought my PC. I promised them that I would handle the expenses for fixing our garage thinking that my income will continue until the market crash happened in 2018 and I lose 80% of my crypto portfolio. I told them that I can't handle the expenses anymore since the value of my assets went down a lot. They don't understand how crypto works so they thought that I was scammed and heard many hurtful words from them with that experience. I've never sold my assets during that crash since the value is almost worthless. I stay away for a few years on the crypto space to focus in my studies. After I finished it in 2020, my group chat in crypto started to become noisy and I found out that the crypto market is starting to go up again. I immediately checked my portfolio and saw that its value recovered by 70%. I was able to recover my money during that pump and use it as a capital to start my crypto jou<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 2:
Early on I made some bad investment decisions with alts and various projects within the cryptospace. No breaking losses, but a waste nonetheless, especially since those decisions that did turn out profitable were in hindsight not profitable enough to justify the risk. Waking up to a project turning out to be a scam, or at least not as groundbreaking as expected -- not a good feeling.With Bitcoin itself though I just watch the ebb and flow of the markets. I watch them closely and with great interest, mind you, but at this point lamenting about missed buying or selling opportunities feels like complaining about the weather. So no bad moments with Bitcoin, but a few with the cryptospace surrounding it.

Topic: Strong Hands Are Buying
### Original post:
We know what time we are going through right now, but we believe everything will be over very soon. And we are hearing lots of FUD and what we are doing is only sharing the news and creating this FUD viral, but those who need opportunity, they just make something else happen. But it's true that this 900B down makes the times very tough for us. But those who believed in crypto saw an opportunity at this time. who we call the strong hand. And they are grabbing much more this time. In the meantime, two of the most powerful crypto influencers added more bitcoin to their treasury. And that is called strong hands grabbing bitcoin.

### Reply 1:
We do not even know if the price by the end of this year will be lesser than $15000, bear market can last like that of 2018 that started in January and lasted long all through the year, that is just it. I understand that it is a buying zone, because people that buy now and hold for like 3 years will make significant profit even if the price of bitcoin still decreases further this time. I agree with this.

### Reply 2:
I mean, if you're bullish on an asset it just makes sense to buy if the price goes down, right? Nothing really surprising here.Also, they're pretty much almost like DCA-ing. And yet most people still try to time bottoms.

Lately i've been going back throught the old satoshi posts and there are at least two i found really interesting.First this one<link> the other is this one<link> main difference i see between bitcoin and a regular commodity is that a regular commodity's price is aligned around production cost, whereas bitcoin is the other way around which is the production cost gravitate around the demand's price.So thats the eternal question around bitcoin is what is supposed to be the ""right"" price for it ?My reasoning is that instead of asking this question peraphs the good question is how to know if it is overpriced ?And the answer would be another question, how do you inflate artificially a commodity market ? By people with too much monney hoarding it to expect the price to rise and making more profit out of it than just exchanging it as utility as a regular use.With this reasoning people with lots of monney hoarding expecting to make a profit would end as the Hunt brothers.People using it as its supposed to be as a commodity or currency would not loose too much as not having too much in stock at any point. Then ok there are always external economic factor that lead to people being more in sav<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
The main difference between Bitcoin and a commodity is that a commodity consumed.The price is always determined by supply and demand.However, the quantity theory of money states that MV=PQ, so the value of the money supply is PQ/V. The supply comes from MV and the demand comes from PQ.The theoretical price can also be thought of as the risk-adjusted discounted future price.Whether or not it is overpriced depends on how you think it compares to these metrics.Hoarding temporarily affects the supply. The price rises as coins are hoarded and likewise it falls as hoarded coins are sold.

### Reply 2:
Well, most governments define Bitcoin and Crypto currencies as Commodities, because they want to protect their Fiat currencies from disruption. All other Fiat currencies can be traded as Commodities (Forex Currency markets) and the same goes for Bitcoin... so it is a Currency and it can be traded as a Commodity. Satoshi just showed the world what will happen if it is only traded as a Commodity... which is not the route most of us wants this experiment to go. (It will be much better if it is a currency, because it will generate miners fees and that is the oil of the whole Bitcoin eco system)

Topic: What is a good hash rate for mining BTC??
### Original post:
Undoubtedly, hashrates are what keep BTC secure. And one needs at least 51% of all the hashrates in the world to comfortably brute force Bitcoin. And to benefit from this, one has to purchase a reliable mining hardware, as it just doesn't depend on price or cost of power alone. I get all these. But where I'll need guidance and more inputs is how then can I get a good hash rate suitable for mining? <link>

### Reply 1:
The last two are litecoin and kadena miners.It mainly depends on the power costs, then the efficiency of the miner, and then the price of the gear in order to get the money spent on the miner back in profit before the miner breaks or becomes unprofitable. The electricity price is from the start something that can turn people away, right no I would say even 10 cents is too much to even think about starting mining, then it comes to your budget for starting mining.There is no ""good and suitable"" hashrate, there is just a profitable one.

### Reply 2:
Bitcoin blockchain is not like password or characters that someone can brute force using a special equipments and tools, only what can happen is miners with over 50% mining hashrate to take advantage of chain reorganization to make 51% attack possible. To mine bitcoin, with the present difficulty adjustment, you will need powerful ASIC miners like Antminer S19j Pro, Antminer L7, Antminer Goldshell KD6 to mine bitcoin. You will have to join a mining pool. To summarize this, you will need to make sure mining bitcoin is legal in your country, calculate the electricity cost and also if your area have cold weather.I hope people like philipma1957 will give you better options to go for about this.

If I wanted to kill bitcoin, then I would write more convincing information that certain people were mining and buying back bitcoins when it was very cheap and now they are manipulating the cryptocurrency market. SBF is one of the representatives of manipulators. And if I see such articles, then I think that the manipulators still have plans for bitcoin.

### Reply 2:
So it will come to the surprise of absolutely no one when ECB walks back their blog statements 50 years later, by which time, several countries and millions more people would adopt it as legal tender.Today I saw a news article: ""Messi invests in money that did not exist 20 years ago"" (they're obviously talking about crypto).That particular argument is going to become unworkable as the decades pass. Today, you can no longer say ""money that did not exist 10 years ago"", now can you?

If so, it's essential to understand the concept of consolidation and how it can benefit your overall Bitcoin strategy.So, what exactly is <truncated> in the world of Bitcoin refers to the process of combining multiple smaller inputs (Bitcoin transactions) into a single larger input within your wallet. This means taking those scattered dust-sized fractions of Bitcoin and amalgamating them into more manageable, larger units.Now, why is consolidation important, particularly for those employing DCA strategies?Reduced Transaction Fees: As you accumulate Bitcoin through regular purchases or earnings, your wallet can become cluttered with numerous small inputs. When you eventually decide to spend or transfer Bitcoin, each input incurs its own transaction fee. Consolidating these inputs into larger ones reduces the number of inputs, thus decreasing transaction fees when you send Bitcoin.Improve<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Well consolidation in Bitcoin is like tidying up your wallet like you merge those tiny bits of Bitcoin into bigger chunks. It's super handy if you're regularly adding to your stash through dollar-cost averaging. This not only makes your wallet less cluttered but also cuts down on transaction fees when you decide to spend or send Bitcoin and it makes your Bitcoin life smoother by improving overall transaction efficiency and beefing up security. We just have to keep in mind the costs involved and privacy concerns before diving into consolidation

I thought they would instantly give customers $20 after registration but this is a referral program offered by Swyftx to all users. It also requires you to verify your identity before it is deposited to your account. I'm not against it but the way it was written in the article made me believe I would only get it at crypto coffee. This is my first time.

### Reply 2:
This is adoption at the very raw level where a real product and service is sold for cryptocurrency. Interesting to see the owner accepts SHIB. If I live nearby I'd probably visit, drink a coffee and take a photo of me for my Instagram. It's possible or someone close, Swyftx is also based in Brisbane. They claimed to be the most popular in AUS. Every country has one.

Topic: What efforts have you made to raise bitcoin awareness in your community?
### Original post:
We live in a modern world, and it is the responsibility of those who are educated to educate those around them, because not everything in this life is learned in school. Aside from attending school, there are numerous ways to learn. We wake up each day and see new things, so learning is all around us.In 2016, a friend of mine suggested that I come and invest in Bitcoin; I was shocked, and I told him that I would not. I thought it was all a scam, and I don't like online stuff because I don't believe in it, so I told my friend, ""Okay, since you said it's not a scam, teach me about bitcoin."" I did some folder research on it and discovered that it is true. My friend introduced me to bitcoin. I began learning how to trade it, and from there I began investing in Bitcoin. My investment gradually grew in my favor, and I began to enjoy the fruits of my labor. I was so surprised when my people transferred the thought I had for my friend before I joined to me. I started spreading the word about bitcoin, and while not everyone believes in it, it has made me less suspicious. Even now, most people believe it is a scam. I noticed that some of us here are raising awareness. No, charity starts at h<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
As far as I can remember there are threads recently of members teaching bitcoin in their community, so that is a good start. And then some members who had businesses online and offline accepting bitcoin as well to raise awareness.So there is a lot of effort that we can do, we can even talk to our friends around or even have small talks. Not necessarily about the benefit and what not, but just introducing bitcoin to them and wake up their curiosity about it is enough, in my opinion.

### Reply 2:
For me I'm not doing any conscious enough to spread awareness about bitcoin. It's better if they will have to discover it themselves and see how they will benefit it from investing or trading BTC.I mean how can you raise awareness if they are not into it? You can talk about if for hours but when you go home, these people might dismiss it and forget about what you have talk earlier about bitcoin.

Topic: Bitcoin clients getting k-lined from the IRC bootstrapping channel
### Original post:
At 21:11 dutch time (CEST), around 10 minutes ago from when I made this post, the Bitcoin clients are getting k-lined.(note, times are CEST.)Code:--- SNIP ---[21:11:36] * u4euc453wZ599zQ has quit (K-Lined)[21:11:37] * u4mZRTtQwC6NskZ has quit (K-Lined)[21:11:37] * x398030675 has quit (K-Lined)[21:11:37] * u4m5AmvGVaM8MNU has quit (K-Lined)[21:11:37] * x92119461 has quit (K-Lined)[21:11:38] * u4iQ9mpGopGTd6D has quit (K-Lined)[21:11:39] * u4iqow5D1WqBmPH has quit (K-Lined)[21:11:39] * u4qsjyU6VRAtfRD has quit (K-Lined)--- SNIP ---Anyhow, this leaves the bitcoin network unable to operate.I see some clients getting back slowly.But this worries me.I suggest we apply what ever other bootstrapping mechanism we have right now, and release 0.3 ASAP.Someone in #freenode suggested this:Code:<gwillen> Xunie: as a potential user of bitcoin, I would suggest that if your project is going to connect to IRC in the background, you should document that fact somewhere. I'm suddenly much more wary of using it now that I know that it does this.This does make Bitcoin seem a bit... malicious to say the least...

It's a relief to hear this.And what were you exactly testing?Like, how can it affect the whole network?If this is a bug that can bring down the whole network, it's pretty serious, heh.

Topic: Is it supposed to take this long to generate some ""phat coin""?
### Original post:
So, I've got the BC client running on my PC for about 2 weeks now.... with ZERO bitcoins to show for it.The FAQ says that, after I get all of the blocks from the network, ""Your average coin creation rate will be (6 * 50 coins / hour) * (your CPU speed / the total CPU speed in the Bitcoin network). At the moment (June 2010) it might be something like 50 coins / day, for example.""Well, I checked the wiki and my clock count matches the count they have there (69649). And the 50 coins / day is a figure that was given for just a month ago.Right now, I'm doing about 400 khash/s, and I've yet to see a single coin.Ideas?

### Reply 1:
The difficulty for generating a block has gone up, it's currently at 181 when it was as low as 23 a few weeks ago. Check out this page for help in calculating your probability of generating a block:<link> in mind that block generation is a lottery, each hash you compute is a ""ticket"", so the faster you generate hashes the more chances you have to win the lottery. For instance, I have a desktop at home that can do about 1600 khash, I ran bitcoin for 3 hours and generated a block, however my desktop at work has been running bitcoin for days with no blocks generated.

### Reply 2:
More incentive for us to create wealth generating services so we can get bitcoins from others.

Topic: My Champions in this Bitcoin Winter
### Original post:
It is glaring that Bitcoin is now in its winter season because of the sharp drop in price. But, just recently I observed that regardless of the fall in price of Bitcoin, an exchange company just put up a giant billboard in my area advertising Bitcoin. The Message is ""Leave Talk, Buy Bitcoin"". Which means "" Stop Talking, Just Buy Bitcoin""The price of putting up such advert is very expensive. We all know that people and businesses are into Bitcoin for personal gains but the truth is that regardless of the challenges Bitcoin is facing, there are some die-hard supporters that believe in the goals and visions of Bitcoin. This individuals and businesses are willing to take the risk and damn the consequences of their continuous unwavering support for Bitcoin. These are my set of Bitcoin heroes that deserves commended. Some of them are highlighted below;Nations Adopting Bitcoin as Legal Tender: Presidents Nayib Bukele and Faustin-Archange Touadera deserve commendation. I might not be able to justify the reason and the implementation process of the adoption of Bitcoin by El Salvador or Central African Republic. Politicians cannot be trusted because most of their economic decisions always ha<rest of post truncated>

Great Information OP....... Right inner my college, during examinations the Bitcoin logo was advertised tagged "" BTC says no to Examination Malpractice "" I'm too lazy to go taking pictures of it , but I'll give it a trial I have also seen alongside the road stating ""BTC is freedom for ever "".As per The Salvadorian President, he has been a great influence for the utilization of Bitcoin BTC within the Nation. Still amazed that some firm's and the average investor's do not use Bitcoin for them business as said by Aljazeraa. Should Bitcoin really be boring before it gets the full awareness it deserves ? Still patiently waiting to see he's prediction come to reality ( Bitcoin reaching 100k this Year ).<link> The aspect of using Bitcoin, out fiat don't really like posses all of those skills. The community have also been helpful in grooming once writing skills as you've said addition of vast information and that's priceless.

Smart people know that the time to invest is when the market is in the red, although many are still quite cautious due to speculation that Bitcoin may not have bottomed out. The current situation is a possible indication that something positive may be happening, although it remains to be seen whether it is a recovery or a bull trap.As for the billboard, it is still a very popular way of advertising, especially in areas where people still do not have access to the Internet to the extent that it is the case in developed countries. Although the idea itself is understandable from the perspective of the advertiser, I hope that they understand how important it is to educate people who buy Bitcoin, if possible before they buy it. If you are not educated and do not understand what you have bought, such an investment can easily turn into a very expensive loss.And as for the rest, I would like to comment on the lending companies, which have proven to be a serious problem, and I see no reason for them to exist at all, and if they have already begun to fail, they should have been allowed to fail until the end. It's just an encouragement for some new companies that will start doing the same bus<rest of post truncated>

Topic: Importance of not letting others know about your crypto holdings
### Original post:
So let me share a real incident with all of you that happened two months before in India. There was a businessman and he used to own some crypto for trading and also as an investment. His friends came to know about exact amount he had which was quite big amount in my country. It happened because he casually mentioned it to them and showed them his investment and profit. Now these friends made a plan and kidnapped him and then asked him to trasfer all the crypto to their wallets. It was about 3 BTC in total. But the good thing was that he escaped them and then told police about all this and the funds were recovered. But he could might have lost his life and all the crypto because of this incident. So the lesson here is to never tell anyone exact amount you hold. You can inform just one member like your parents or wife about this so that they can recover the funds in case anything happens to you but never tell this information to casual friends or distant relatives.

### Reply 1:
This topic applies to many things in life. For example, it's even been said that you shouldn't talk about the things you want to do. Those who say this are right. Because Bitcoin may not be the only thing stolen. Methods that will allow you to earn income for buying Bitcoin can also be stolen. That's why we shouldn't talk about everything. There's no point in saying that and taking risks. The outcome of such events can also be undesirable. Therefore, paying attention and thinking for a few minutes before speaking can save us from negative consequences.

### Reply 2:
You may share it to those people who you really want to share it with ,that's just simple but avoid sharing your 100% asset. There's no need to show everything because it will just put you at risk; of being borrowed from or killed. These possibilities are no joke and has tendency of occuring especially if that's the wrong person whom you shared it with. Keep in mind that money talks and money is a powerful piece of paper. Just know the limits or lose everything, you choose.They know their thing. If they really want to brag it they might be expecting something from other people which is for others to envy him/her(just an example, it could also be an inspiration but this is more likely to happen). If there is awareness on the risks, then he must be okay with consequences.

Topic: What you can benefit from investing in Bitcoin
### Original post:
As a late investor in Bitcoin, I have come to realize some benefits from investing in this cryptocurrency which includes:1: With just your smartphone you can carry out financial services.2: In bitcoin, you have full control of your financial assets. You have ownership to your private keys which is not always available in our normal banking.3: As freelancer who works online, you can use bitcoin to facilitate some of your transactions.4: As a business owner or an entrepreneur one can accept payment in Bitcoin. 5: When there is currency devaluation, one can use Bitcoin to protect their wealth even though there is risk of price volatility.For any individual who has not invested in Bitcoin, I would advise you to give it a try. Ignorance shouldn't prevent you from investing in Bitcoin. Read, research, and gather all the knowledge you need to know about it here.

### Reply 1:
Bitcoin investment is never too late, even if it seems late because of the current price. You can always find a way to invest in it, especially in holdings. You can do DCA, where you can buy a portion of bitcoin in a certain period of time, for example, every week, depending on the financial stability of the investors. I also enter a late year in bitcoin, in 2020. I am discouraged when I see the high price of bitcoin, but the thing is, I didn't stop investing. I kept on learning and finding a way to earn in bitcoin, and it didn't go wrong because I discovered a lot of ways to earn and it came out fine because until now I can earn on my own, I can earn through my knowledge and experience. So bitcoin investment will never be too late; you just have to find a way to earn it. It's up to you on how resourceful you are.

### Reply 2:
Exactly by using bitcoin you can see or monitor your own transactions you have full hold on your coins if you are using decentralized exchange you can send or receive bitcoin directly without any third partyIf you are someone who values their privacy even working it would be really great to use bitcoin or crypto as a way for your clients to pay you

Topic: Today is the story of my investment in Bitcoin
### Original post:
I decided yesterday morning that I would buy 1 bitcoin from this dip market. But I did not have enough money. With which I can buy 1 bitcoin. I had an Fixt Deposit of $ 6,000 in the central bank. And the bank would paying interest at the rate of 5.5% APR. I broke it down yesterday and decided to buy Bitcoin with that money. But with this money I will not be able to buy 1 bitcoin. On the other hand, my dream and desire is to buy 1 bitcoin. I then decided to take a loan and applied to the bank for a loan. But I told the bank that I would use this money for business. The bank agreed to give me a loan of $10,000 at 10% APR interest. I take advantage of that opportunity and take out a loan. And the remaining $ 4,000 I borrowed from my uncle and promised to pay him 8% APR interest, which is more then bank interest. Finally i bought just now 1 BTC price at $20,000. It gives me a different feeling That feeling I have never had before. I think if I hold this bitcoin for 2 years I can get 100% -500% profit. Then I will be able to easily repay my debtors with an average interest of 18-19% in 2 years as an average of 9.something% APR and I will be able to keep a huge profit.

### Reply 1:
I find is an extremely risky move. Of course, it may pay off. But I hope that you have a backup plan in case bitcoin price doesn't go as expected in the next 2 years.And yes, make sure you have very safe means of storage for your newly acquired coins: hardware wallet or even safely (offline) generated seed or private key; and the backup/recovery should also be safe and offline.Best of luck!

### Reply 2:
Yes i am using Hardware Wallet. Since I'm holding a full of bitcoin. And i bought it with borrowed money. So I have to take care of it a lot. So I saved it in a hardware wallet. As if one is not stolen in any way. The rest is my luck

Topic: Carrot Courses: Earn bitcoin while learning about Bitcoin
### Original post:
Carrot is a company that pays small amounts of Bitcoin for completing different tasks. You get sats in your carrot app and then you can withdraw them to your own lightning wallet. You can also read Bitcoin Magazine articles directly from the app to get some free sats as well.Recently they created a new site, Carrot Courses: <link> currently have one active course:But they're planning to add more:After you read the material and watch the videos, there are some quizzes. If you get at least 90% correctly, you get a few sats.Here's an example of the type of things being presented in the Intro to Bitcoin course:This might be something that helps educating the population in general in an easy way, and also they can get a few sats for free while doing so. Also, more advanced courses coming in the future might be interesting for bitcoiners.

### Reply 1:
It's a lovely initiative! I haven't heard of the company before, though, so what is its reputation? I tried googling it, but the name is not helping to get the relevant results, and those I got were, I think, for a different company called Carrot (a food store). Of course, the payments are probably tiny anyway, but reputation matters for other reasons, such as being sure that installing it is safe and doesn't add any malware, for example, or that the information one has to learn is accurate. Has anyone tried these courses? What was your impression?

### Reply 2:
This is a very good initiative. It should be something we remember when introducingnew people we meet to Bitcoin, its a nice incentive to earn while learning eventhough Iimagine its small amounts.The website is minimal, I was hoping to find out who is behind this eventhough I probably wouldnt know them but more importantly whats in it for Carrot?

Topic: Bitcoin and LETS
### Original post:
Hey all,I think it would be really neat if someone would approach/email (or whatever) all of the communities using LETS and got them involved in Bitcoin. Perhaps exchanging in/out of LETS could be achieved as well.There is a lot of real world commerce (as in, not just on the internet) on the LETS system and I think it would benefit both systems to form some sort of alliance.

### Reply 1:
Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS) also known as LETSystems are local, non-profit exchange networks in which goods and services can be traded without the need for printed currency. In some places, e.g. Toronto, the scheme has been called the Local Employment and Trading System.Michael Linton originated the term ""Local Exchange Trading System"" in 1983 and, for a time ran the Comox Valley LETSystems in Courtenay, British Columbia. The system he designed was intended as an adjunct to the national currency, rather than a replacement for it, although there are examples of individuals who have managed to replace their use of national currency through inventive usage of LETS.[citation needed]LETS networks use interest-free local credit so direct swaps do not need to be made. For instance, a member may earn credit by doing childcare for one person and spend it later on carpentry with another person in the same network. In LETS, unlike other local currencies, no scrip is issued, but rather transactions are recorded in a central location open to all members. As credit is issued by the network members, for the benefit of the members themselves, LETS are considered mutual credit systems. Th<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 2:
I doubt you can convince them to use bitcoin INSTEAD of LETS. You could try to convince them to use bitcoin instead of national currencies. That makes far more sense. You could to convince them to use bitcoin to trade between different LETS communities without using national currencies.In fact, they don't need bitcoin to do that. They could run one Ripple network instead of two LETS. The problem is that right now the two communities should share the same server since Ripple doesn't have a distributed implementation yet.Nevertheless, I think that all the different critics of national currencies (whether you prefer bitcoin, ripple, LETS, barter, gold or silver) have a lot to talk about.

""Computational problems"" isn't the most informative answer (P2P program is supposed to use only your internets connection, not your processor), so, I am asking here: why in the name of Chuck Norris Bitcoin is using my CPU so much? What is it actually doing?

### Reply 1:
Simple answer because it's 2:38am here:hashing

### Reply 2:
P2P programs don't have to be bandwidth limited. It just happens that the majority of widely deployed P2P networks do file transfers and are limited by your connection speed. The computation work to data transferred is more like distributed computing projects like SETI@Home or Folding@Home rather than file transfer.Suffice it to say that it is verifying transactions and cryptography strength hashes are computationally expensive, and this is good for the value of a bitcoin. For further detail, again, see the paper or the source code.

Topic: A blog about someone planning to retire early with Bitcoin
### Original post:
The other day I've found this interesting blog about someone in Europe planning to retire early by converting a fixed amount of their monthly salary into Bitcoin.He started doing this in the bull market of 2017 and keeps doing it every month, no excuses. A specific amount, 500 euros, is always converted into Bitcoin and stored away in cold storage.This is how his strategy looks like:As you can see, the BTC stack in orange always keeps going up, making it a personal ATH for him every time.In a black dashed line is the actual total invested in fiat, which simply increases by 500 euro every month.And in green you can see the value in fiat(euro) of his current amount of Bitcoin. This one of course varies a lot depending on the current price of Bitcoin.You can clearly see that it has been an incredibly great savings strategy so far, obtaining a lot more value than simply saving in fiat.I'll leave you guys with the url of the blog: <link> the end, perseverance seems to be the key here. He's not putting an incredible amount of money down every month, but still he has managed to obtain a lot of Bitcoin, 4.47 BTC from his last update.Have you tried something similar?, maybe now thinking abo<rest of post truncated>

This is a perfect explanation of how Bitcoin is the best crypto currency to withstand inflation. Many a time people are told to invest not save but they seem to get confused. Investing overtime brings about profits which in turn covers losses caused by inflation. Now Bitcoin currently is the best digital currency that could serve both as an asset and a peer to peer currency.Someone who saved $42k in fiat would find out that in a 3 year period of time $42k won't be worth as much as it used to. However someone who bought Bitcoin worth of $42k about 3 years ago will find out that due to increase in value of Bitcoin, that amount would have been over 46k which would cover for both losses caused by inflation and still leaving an extra amount of profit. Bitcoin is a win win investment asset for both inflation and profit.

### Reply 2:
$500 is already an incredible and high amount at least IMHO. Whether you live in a first-world or third-world country, that amount is already significant and way back even higher than before this crazy inflation came. What we can learn here is that the accumulation through DCA is always going to be worth it. People may find the strategy to be lowkey at the beginning but that's the purpose of it, the effect will be seen in the long term and that's why it is important that someone has a long term plan or if not, a short term plan. But anyway, the majority of us here have already decided to stay in the long run.

Topic: What if you plan to buy BTC for big money: Would you reuse a tested address?
### Original post:
Last night we (five friends) had a lively discussion about reusing receiving addresses. The consensus was: for small amounts, new (never used) addresses are the way to go. Especially to protect privacy. But what if you plan to buy BTC for a lot of money at once? Like 10,000 or 50,000 USD or even more?Would you use an address twice to be 100% sure that the address works as expected and sends the BTC to your wallet? Would you perform a test transaction first and then reuse the address for the main purchase if the test is successful? Or would you trust the wallet's algorithm and use a new address, even if you buy for a lot of money? Fun fact: there were 5 of us and it felt like 8 different points of view! :-)

### Reply 1:
As long as the wallet is not compromised then it's okay for you to use it again. Well, if you prefer to different wallet or different address then that's also okay as long as it is not compromised. The only concern here is that you didn't send it to other wallet address that isn't yours which is to double or even triple check that it's the right address. It's your choice by the way if you use the address more than once or not but as you can see in the post above, that's what I will advice too for you to do.

### Reply 2:
You do not have to do this, what you must do is to ensure that you have downloaded the wallet from the original website and verified the download. Moving on, you must also make sure that you run the wallet in an airgapped device that is completely disconnected from the internet or in a hardware wallet. If you do all this, you can simply take any of the wallet addresses to receive the funds.Take note that your funds is only as safe as the device you store it in, so you must ensure you use it in a very safe environment and avoid reusing addresses because it is bad for privacy.

Topic: Paying with Bitcoin.
### Original post:
So, after reading a thread and realizing that paying with Bitcoin would mean that you'd be paying with future returns, I went on to research the topic of paying for goods and services with Bitcoin. Bitcoin is decentralized meaning that it can be transferred to anyone without the interference of intermediate/ central authorities. This also implies that buying goods and services would be faster and easier if more people owned and accepted Bitcoin. If Bitcoin was adopted and accepted as a means of exchange in many countries then there would be a huge improvement in various and global economies.It'll enable more people to access financial services and knowledge, reduce the rate at which bank charges are being paid, values gotten by sellers will increase rapidly, anonymity and many others. Apart from the loss on the buyers's part, Bitcoin has lots of disadvantages which would be challenges and pose lots of unhealthy risks if adopted.After doing my research, I came to realize that this may probably be influenced by personal choices. Because looking at it thoroughly, some people would pay for items using things like Gold, Land, and other assets. But in the eyes of a money literate, that m<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Why do you think Bitcoin was created in the first place?If not for the fact that Bitcoin has gained stability and adoption rate exponentially over the years that it can now be used as a perfect asset, it was initially meant by the creator SATOSHI as a peer to peer currency without the government as a third party.Another thing that makes people use Bitcoin as an asset than a P2P currency aside from the returns is because of the fact that fees can sometimes be uneconomical due to congestions in the mempool otherwise, Bitcoin is a perfect P2P currency.

### Reply 2:
Op I don't think there is anything to explain here because the first thing anyone would do when he or she join bitcoin investment or want to join is to know the meaning of bitcoin and it advantages and disadvantages and if you have known the meaning then the way you see it from the article and that is how it is. Bitcoin is digital currency which is meant to buy things and pay for services digitally. So if anyone likes to accept bitcoin in his or her business and you have bitcoin to pay for it then you pay and get you product or person render the services you paid for so what are you asking us to tell you our reasons of accepting bitcoin. This is ridiculous. If using bitcoin to pay for gold and land is wrong as you said after your research then there is no need to argue again because you have read it by yourself and yet you are saying it is wrong. Then you let it be.

The accounts are numbered (they are PGP keys) so in this respect, they are pseudonymous.The digital cash is untraceable. Meaning, you can see that account# 38272 exchanged a token, but you don't know where it came from, and you won't know where he spends it. (Because the token was blinded when the bank first issued it.) In fact, you don't even know if he's just exchanging the same token over and over again because he's bored. To learn more about this, google about Chaumian blinding.Then by adding an HTTPS interface, you gain full anonymity for cash token exchanges (as long as the user connects over Tor). But of course, in this case the user doesn't have access to cheques, transfers, or cashier's cheques, since he is now operating ""cash-only"".

The only problem with this system is that you called it digital ""cash"".I like everything else about it though.

Topic: Profiting from BTC: just luck?
### Original post:
Introduced in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, BTC was envisioned as a new global currency for the internet age [1]. While Satoshi intended for widespread adoption, BTC has primarily become a store of value. While I believe everyone should have access to Bitcoin, with its open network allowing anyone to create an account and transact, it's important to acknowledge that profiting from BTC may not be the chance for everyone.Throughout Bitcoin's history, periods of thrilling price surges have been followed by sharp corrections. During these downturns, also known as crypto winters, Bitcoin's price has fallen by a staggering 77% to 93% compared to its previous peak. In simpler terms, the price has dropped 4-10 times. These harsh winters act as a crucible, testing the resolve of Bitcoin holders. Those who remain confident in Bitcoin's long-term potential, often referred to as ""diamond hands,"" are contrasted with those who hate BTC, or ""anti-fans.""Michel Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, has become a well-known figure in the cryptocurrency world. He is credited with leading MicroStrategy's strategy of accumulating Bitcoin since 2020, which has resulted in a significant profit for the company: ov<rest of post truncated>

Luck? Luck does play a role in market changes, but making profits from holding isn't about luck. It's about being willing to hold onto your investments for a long time. Holding onto investments, especially with Bitcoin, can be challenging because you might feel tempted to sell when you see others making quick gains.As a long term holder, it's important to not worry too much about short term market changes. This mindset helps prevent you from selling your coins at the wrong time. Bitcoin has seen so many ups and downs like in 2021 when it reached its previous all time high and then experienced a downturn. This downturn might have led many long term holders to sell out of fear of uncertain doubt(FUD), fear of missing out(FOMO).These types of holders are what I call ""weak."" As a holder, you shouldn't be swayed by short-term market trends. Bitcoin's unique qualities, like its limited supply of 21 million coins, attract investors who understand the principles of supply and demand. When a product is limited or scares, its price tends to rise due to increased demand and limited supply.In the future, Bitcoin will likely become even more valuable.

How challenging it is to invest and overcome hundreds of hurdles to hold your investment for a long time is only known to those investors who invest with a long term objective and who hold their investment for a long time. When you invest many people will call you stupid and many people will laugh at your investment but when you invest successfully those same people will tell you that you are very lucky. We see such people in every society. So since I am investing myself, we should not give priority to what other people say or laugh about my investment, we should only stick to our own decisions. When we overcome hundreds of hurdles and keep investing by accepting all challenges then we will definitely get profit from investment but we should have enough patience for this profit.

Topic: Is my second Transaction working correctly? +Transfer Question
### Original post:
So, I finally got my client to start generating and after I got my laptop optimized for the task and waited over night. My first transaction completed resulting in +50 Coins. Yay!!However, once that transaction was complete, a new transaction hasn't started. Or maybe it has. There's only one transaction in the list but I'm up to 131 Blocks under ""Status"". Is this the way it's supposed to happen? Does it keep processing on the same transaction and generating coins every 120 blocks or so? Or is it supposed to start a new transaction?I have a Screen Shot if needed. Sorry if this is a basic question but I'm sure someone will ask if I don't.Thanks for taking the initiative on this project Mr. Satoshi. Maybe one day I can fire my bank once and for all.EDIT: I decided to stop playing around and I set BitCoin up on my high powered gaming rig, forwarded 8333 to it, and started generating on it instead of my laptop. So then I transferred my previous 50 coins to that client but it's been an hour and nothing has shown up for me to accept the transfer. Both computers are on the same wireless LAN.

### Reply 1:
The transfer is immediate if you send by IP address. If you send by bitcoin address and the recipient isn't online at the time, it might take 30 minutes or more to see it. Also, the recipient needs to be synced up with the block chain before it'll see the received transaction. That means the status bar at the bottom needs to say at least 33000 blocks, like ""x connections 33200 blocks x transactions"".Would it be clearer if the status said ""x confirmations"", <truncated> confirmations7 confirmations8 confirmationsEach block essentially means another node has confirmed that it agrees with all transactions up to that point.

### Reply 2:
Congratulations and welcome to the forum The number of blocks of a transaction is the amount of new blocks that have been generated by the whole network after the transaction. Each new block in the chain means new coins to its creator. One ""generated"" -transaction in your transaction list means that you have generated one block. You're not the first one to find the concept of a ""block"" a bit confusing on the first sight.There's no confirmation of incoming transactions when someone sends to your Bitcoin address, all transactions are automatically completed. Did the transaction show up in the transaction list?Other nodes aren't going to know which IP you're sending to, your client just connects directly to it. Both IP's are fine as long as the connection routes to the right computer. Anyway, I'd use the inner address inside a network for simplicity.

I've been trying to shepherd the article through the process that will get it accepted. The article discussion page is currently going through the rounds trying to decide how much of the article ought to be based upon Satoshi's white paper, with one ""contributor"" arguing to throw that white paper out completely as a source of information.The article itself was put back as a ""regular"" article on December 14th, and has had a very steady rate of development since. There is one agitator who tried to suggest it needed to get thrown back to the deletion discussion, but at least for now that idea has been quashed. Essentially, Bitcoin has met the minimum standards for ""notability"" by the Wikipedia community which is why the article exists now.As a general warning: edit the Wikipedia article at your own risk! It is getting a whole lot of attention lately and as a result has some long-time veterans who are injecting their own spin on Bitcoin. Most of them are only reading the press releases for information and are completely dismissing this website for information. It sort of gives a jaded view of the project, but I'll leave that as it may be.

### Reply 2:
That's what happens when people don't follow sources and just make it up. The article needs a thorough clean up. Would you like every forum goer to just be able to post their individual view of bitcoin straight onto wikipedia? It will happen for a while and the article will get very messy and biased and then hopefully it will be cleaned up

The WP page should discuss the maintenance cost of the p2p network. Not only are there costs associated with the generation of the bitcoins, but their value can only be maintained as long as the 'proof-of-work' network is available and stable.This cost, of course, is difficult to calculate but it is non-zero, though it may be trivial. There is opportunity cost associated with the storage and maintenance of the network itself. This could be seen as analogous to third-party gold storage fees.

Topic: A couple of questions/comments
### Original post:
I've got a couple of thoughts floating around and I guess this is the place to put them. Sorry if it makes for a longish post but I'd rather not just show up and immediately start a whole collection of threads.First a brief introduction, I run an online game and was pointed this direction by a user asking about bitcoins being added as one of the payment/donation methods. I've been lurking here about a week now and after generating a block yesterday decided to do some experimenting, I tend to find playing with things hands-on is the best way to learn how they work. So what I did is design and implement a basic money game like those you would see using egold. You can find the results here <link> It is fully functional, maybe a little slow to process payments due to bitcoind not running on the server (no offense to the coders but I'm not ready to trust that on one of my production servers). Feel free to play with it if you want, in theory it should only hand back out 96% of the bitcoins going in but there's not a huge reserve if someone starts winning so pay attention to the maximum bid it lists. And now here's the questions that I've happened across while experimenting.I would have l<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
That is kind of what I had gathered from my brief look through the code but I didn't want to just assume there wasn't anything to use. It's not really a necessity, I just like the idea of it being verifiable. I am using the highres timestamp so it has microsecond precision and shouldn't be easily predicted given normal variances in network speed and the number of hops to be received, for my purposes it should be as good as I'd get from a PRNG.I see. Given the way that it works now there is a good 10-15 second delay anyway, I suppose what this means is just that if I do end up moving the bitcoind closer to the webserver I should just artificially maintain that delay.Will look into it. For now I can run the full GUI version without a problem but again if I were to move it out onto one of the webservers I would want to make sure there was some way to get at that information just in case.Thanks for your responses, enjoy your winnings

### Reply 2:
The requested max bid is automatic based on what kind of balance it has available, it'll change as people play and is basically there as a warning so you don't start bidding more than it has available to pay off. Was close for a while, I know the recommended max had dropped to 0.1 earlier this afternoon but for now it seems to have more of a reserve built up.Only issue with having the play again autofill the address is that there is no authentication on any of those pages, you can fill in any transaction id and it will give the page for it. I don't put the amounts or address on that page for that reason either. To do otherwise would require some sort of registration and account and it was intended more as something to try quickly (and relatively anonymously) without needing an account.Would it actually be a problem if the return address was available to anyone? I suppose they are visible to anyone as they cross the bitcoin network anyway, not sure if having it available on the page would give any more information than could be gotten anyway. I suppose I'm just accustomed to being very careful with any data entered by the user that may be private, if there isn't any harm done by hav<rest of post truncated>

Often times we attribute the benefit of Bitcoin only to financial and economic sector of various businesses and nations.

Especially now that it is rising faster than we expectedHere are some of the benefit I can think of:Data <truncated> of data is very essential for a health organization.

Normal funding processes can be time consuming, however, the Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) that is offered by the Bitcoin technology provides a more seamless approach to funding researchers and healthcare start ups by raising funds directly from individuals and organizations that are interested in the research by issuing tokens.Effective Payment process.One of the advantages of Bitcoin technology is the ability to make seamless payment<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Applying blockchain technology to the healthcare sector is something that I have read about, I think but it's not that mainstream. I'm not really sure. I think it could improve some of the old technology that the healthcare industry has and I believe that it can be of help. In terms of BTC, maybe acceptance of payment? IDK how BTC could help as it is or something.

### Reply 2:
Maybe Incase you're missing these out, Bitcoin is being applicable on every sectors of the economy, because people make use of bitcoin regardless of the place or professional settings they are as well as the way many industries have key into the use of the blockchain technology in performing many better security practice on their services, products and data, this will have to depend on the aspect we want to make it applicable and our target towards achieving this base on our desirability of bitcoin on a decentralized network of blockchain technology.

Topic: Bitcoin depletion?
### Original post:
I understand that the number of bitcoins is inherently limited. What happens if someone gets (one way or another) some number of bitcoins and then either loses his wallet to (hard drive crash, hurricane, accidental wipe, death of the owner, whatever). Are these bitcoins lost forever and taken out of circulation? So, finite number of bitcoins going to be infinitely depleted?I gather that the value of bitcoin will rise as a result. They are also divisible, so we should have bigger supply of smaller parts as a result. But are they infinitely divisible?

That still is a pretty hard limit. I would even go so far as to say ""famous last words"" as the folks who came up with IPv4 had to deal with the exhaustion of the address space (about 4 billion IP addresses). Unfortunately the current demand world-wide is about 15-20 billion at the moment, and no end in sight about how many more may eventually be needed, hence IPv6.Back elsewhen nobody thought that there could ever be any exhaustion of the IPv4 address space as the total number of computers that could ever conceivably be put onto a computer network was in the 100k range. Gordon Moore famously made a joke about how microprocessors would become common to the point where a typical high-end hotel would have at least one microprocessor for every doorknob in the hotel. He didn't expect to see that actually happen about 15 years later when quite literally every doorknob in the hotel he gave that address in put in microprocessors... for security purposes.I really don't know how far and wide that bitcoins will go, but limiting them to just 1 million or even a trillion may seem in the long run as something of a major shortcoming.

Topic: When will Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy sell BTC?
### Original post:
MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, has become a prominent player in the Bitcoin market through its aggressive accumulation strategy. Their recent purchase of 850 BTC in January 2024 signals continued confidence in Bitcoin's potential[1], especially considering their reported $4 billion profit on previous investments[2]. This stands in stark contrast to mid-2022, when the company faced criticism for incurring significant losses[3].Saylor claims MicroStrategy will never sell their Bitcoin[4], positioning them as unwavering ""diamond hands"". However, as a publicly traded company with profit-seeking shareholders like Capital International Investors, Vanguard, and Blackrock[5], the pressure to capitalize on significant price increases cannot be ignored.While missing out on 2021's peak proved costly, MicroStrategy's MSTR stock price has surged nearly 500% since their initial Bitcoin investment in July 2020[6]. However, some argue that failing to take profits during bull runs contradicts optimal investment strategies.While Saylor's personal belief in Bitcoin's future might be genuine, shareholder pressure could compel MicroStrategy to reconsider its stance if Bitcoin reaches significant<rest of post truncated>

What you say is true. They can sell shares without selling a single Bitcoin, but what about the new buyers of the shares? They will become owners of Bitcoin. Do you guarantee that they will not sell Bitcoin? Then we will return to the first question: If they sell these huge amounts of Bitcoin, what will happen to the price?Michael Saylor has proven that he is a strong believer in Bitcoin and kept all of his Bitcoin during the difficult days that passed for Bitcoin in the bear market and almost caused the bankruptcy of the company, but he remained steadfast despite all that, but in the end this is a profitable company and it is certain that they want to get some profits, so they must sell. Some stocks or some Bitcoin when the market is high enough for them.

### Reply 2:
I don't think you understand how stocks works. As a shareholder in Microstrategy, or any other company, you are only allowed to buy and sell your share of the company. It has nothing to do with buying and selling any actual bitcoin which you cannot dictate for Microstrategy to do.

Topic: Can Someone Explain This Transaction?
### Original post:
I was browsing recent transactions and came across this one from a few hours ago. It caught my eye since it was 82,273 sat/vB, i.e., $24,663 The high rate was not the only thing, it seemed to have had the fee bumped 6 times in about 5 minutes, it had started at about a 24,181 sat/vB, quite a bit lower but still much higher than necessary. But it gets weirder, it is sending about .91 bitcoin from 2 addresses and sending to the SAME addresses. Is there any logic to what was happening?<link>

### Reply 1:
The plot thickens...The wallet seems to be sending dust to itself lately, several payments of - 0.00000600 BTC.<link> this is something to do with ordinals?Nor I, but along with the other weird transactions at that address, it seems intentional.

### Reply 2:
There is no logical reasoning for this instance but this isn't new, in the past there are much worse incidents like users paid 100 BTC as fee for moving 1 BTC but those are legitimate mistakes while this TX doesn't look like happened due to mistake cause I see there is another similar TX made after using high fee and spent to the same address.

Consider yourself lucky. But you can't always count on luck, because luck is a fickle thing and you can't make a lot of money on luck alone. After all, someday you may be unlucky and lose all your money. In investments, luck should be in the last place.

You must be happy at the profit on your bitcoin investment, bit I will tell you that your have not hodli for up to a circle. If you can hodli your bitcoin in the bear market that is when you are a good hodler. I hope that you don't have plans to sell those bitcoin in the bull market, and if you have plans to to that, then you should have a price target that when bitcoin reaches, you can sell and take profit. This is because bitcoin price will not be bullish alone, the bear market will come after the bull run.

A few years ago, entomologist Dr Dan Bickel discovered a new species of fly while working at the Australian Museum.This museum gives the ability to name new species to their members, who have to bid to win the naming rights. Mark Carnegie and Sergei Sergienko did just that, interestingly, using Bitcoin.I find it fascinating that traditional institutions like the Australian Museum are embracing Bitcoin.So, there you have it, we now officially have a Bitcoin fly:

This seems funny. Bitcoin has become a sign of online payments more than PayPal and Visa, which have topped the lists for years. Therefore, you may find it natural for some who believe in change or not to cling to the past to defend it. Now, when you search for the word Bitcoin, you have to specialize in any field you want to search.

I have an uncle who has the attitude of reading old newspapers and we will laugh at him. But he would tell us that newspapers don't get outdated because there is always information inside that is new to you . This great news is almost two years old and I am just reading it for the first time, indeed information is evergreen. Some people are doing everything possible to promote Bitcoin awareness and adoption. Mark Carnegie and Sergei Sergienko have decided to give Bitcoin a legacy in the animal industry. ""Chrysosoma bitcoin"" will forever be the name of a colorful and beautiful fly that is found in Papua New Guinea. It is also wonderful to know that a reputable organization like the Australian Museum also accepts Bitcoin.

Topic: Proposed solution to the latency problem (vending machine problem).
### Original post:
HiI started a thread about the lack of fast local double spending verification aweek ago. I was away for a week, and couldn't follow up on the thread. Duringthis week, I became even more positive about bitcoin. Contrary to what I saidlast week, I think that bitcoin could be a stand alone system; no issuer basedsystems are needed to coexist with bitcoin. Bitcoin could be the real thing!Kudos to all that have participated in it. However, fast verification of theabsence of double spending is still important. I think, I have a solution thatmore or less achieves it.I should stress, that the underlying bitcoin architecture is <truncated> My solution is living on top of bitcoin, so to speak.Key to fast double spending verifications is to give coins a ""location"". A coincan be local to such and such server in New York, for instance. A New Yorkcoin can be spent anywhere. It is valid anywhere etc. It is just that you canexpect faster double spending verification in NY. Coins don't have to have alocation.My proposed solution is to incorporate an extra field in outgoing <truncated> a double spending verification server. A coin's double <truncated> server is the one of the last outgoing transact<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Gavin, your solution has high latency. I want to solve the problem of locality. You can get double spending verification at a time scale that does not grow with the total size of the network. There are two uses of this. One is for high speed trading, i.e. millisecond latency, the other is for huge networks. The vending machine might be on Mars for that matter.This is why locality should be built in in some way.Your method is simply too slow for me, otherwise it works of course. On this planet, your method would preclude verifications faster than 200 milliseconds say. The speed of light is the fundamental problem.

### Reply 2:
Mars is more extreme but there is an ATM in Antarctica.<link> like this article because it points out the difference between currency and money. There is a fixed amount of currency in Antarctica, but that amount is completely unrelated to how much money the people there own. (mere account balances) Yet, bafflingly to some, the system works quite swimmingly for all involved. The mars situation could work exactly the same way.

Topic: Could supermarkets use local servers to accept Bitcoin in a banking failure?
### Original post:
It seems that the central servers for Sainsbury's, Tesco and McDonalds ( amongst others) are down at the moment. Not so long ago, Visa failed across the whole of the UK. Now I carry some cash to cover me when this happens. However, it occured to me that, assuming that the Internet is still live, then shops could use Bitcoin to accept payments, and link to the mempool via a local server, or perhaps they could use lightning. The main accounts could be updated when the system is live again.I suspect this scenario is unlikely, but is it technically feasible?

### Reply 1:
Do not mind me, I do not really understand what you are expressing. There is nothing like local servers. If you have a bitcoin wallet, there are many servers that you can connect to automatically which are available, all the servers can not all go down or stop working at ones.

### Reply 2:
I don't know if this network of a thing is a global challenge or not, but currently in my location here, its been almost three days we have been having a network issue.This is possible as long as the organization in consideration is willing to make an inventory on that, they can generate data of every payment made in bitcoin since once can have a statement of account in bitcoin, also they can make bitcoin serve as an alternative payment mode whether the network is working perfectly or not.

So you weren't screaming, there were no people around, they just took you to a car in broad daylight and drove away? Unless it was 4 am... That's a lot of money to be carrying around on your phone. You either are very rich and $20k is nothing, or you're very careless. I own much more bitcoin than that and I'd never carry even .1 BTC with me. There's just nothing that I'd need to buy in person that costs this much. For larger transactions I'd send bitcoin from home.When you gave them the phone and password, what happened next? Did they just leave, or drop you off somewhere? I hope the police finds them, good luck. All this could be avoided if only people learn not to carry a lot of money with them and not tell others they're bitcoin investors. The attackers knew that you own bitcoin from someone. These people knew you had bitcoin and how you look like. They recognized you, ""called you to a job"" so they had your number. It wasn't a random robbery.

### Reply 2:
This was not an incident but a long-planned robbery, and if you check well within your circle, you might find more information that will help you trace them than trying to scan through the address in an exploration, as it might lead you into a dead end. Once it's moved into a platform with a mixing service, that's where the tracking might end.Just check the people you might have discussed your holdings with who know how much you own and the pattern they use in luring you into the job interview who know the kind of job you do and can use such a job to lure you in. You need to start making small internal investigations within your secure, and maybe you discover a trace.This is the reason why it's always advisable for one to keep their crypto holdings, especially when it's something worth a fortune. Many people can do anything possible to obtain that amount from you. There are a lot of greedy and hungry people on the street, and their getting their hands on such information will put you in danger as you will be their target.

### Original post:
I was sent this question in email:Why can't somebody just create a version of the software that gives you extra bitcoins?... and couldn't find a good, non-geeky answer in the FAQs. So I wrote one:When you spend some bitcoins, the software on your machine has to prove to the software running on everybody else's machine that those bitcoins are valid.How does it do that? Well, it is a little bit complicated; you've got to understand how bitcoins are created, and how they are traded.First, how they're created: 50 bitcoins are created approximately every 10 minutes. Everybody who is trying to create bitcoins is in a race to try to find those 50 bitcoins; they are really hard to find, but, once found, it is easy to verify that, yes, indeed, your bitcoin software found them, so you get to spend them.Second, how they're traded: Imagine you did find 50 bitcoins (well, your computer found them by running the bitcoin software for a few months or a year they are not easy to find, and are harder to find the more people who are looking for them). You trade them to me by sending them to my bitcoin address. Inside the software, a messages is created and then broadcast to everybody that says These <rest of post truncated>

I like the mining example on a number of other aspects too, as analogies aren't always perfect either. Mining sort of indicates that steady sustained effort is going to get you the block.The point though is that the whole thing is random chance based purely upon probability. The resources, what you devote, is strictly to generate more ""tickets"". I'm sure some people feel that way when they buy up blocks of hundreds of lotto tickets as well. And just like is happening now with Bitcoin, people also put lottery tickets into pools to collectively share any ""winnings"" based upon various rules of those pools. I have heard of groups as large as 50-100 people in a pool of that nature win a multi-million dollar lotto too.The mining analogy breaks down as most miners usually look for a particular vein of ore and stick with that vein where extraction costs and ore quality are rather predictable. Mining stops when the vein runs out, the mine shuts down, or when the extraction costs become too expensive, such as if the mine gets too deep underground to cost-effectively bring the stuff to the surface. None of this has analogies to Bitcoin at all.Also, if you run Bitcoin with a generator for only<rest of post truncated>

Topic: Incubating Funds
### Original post:
How about a ycombinator type program for bitcoin businesses? Say, you fill out an application and VC fundie check the application to see if the business proposal have value and approve/disapprove. Once you got approved, you basically get X amount of funds from the pool and in return 10% of the revenues.This will be more useful for services that need more than just a web host and coding chops.

### Reply 1:
Mizerydearia wanted to build a kickstarter clone for bitcoin which I guess is similar to ycombinator. Maybe this could be a community project that everyone can get behind and also review proposals before they go to the vcaps? Many hands make light work.

### Reply 2:
I would prefer trying to start our own internal VC like ycombinator over kickstarter, but that's mostly because my video editing skills are piss-poor (nonexistent). No reason we couldn't do both if we have enough funding though.

Topic: If everyone is holding their bitcoin, will there be a balance?
### Original post:
I have read several posts encouraging people to hold their bitcoin for the greater good of bitcoin and probably more reward in the future. I have also been able to buy some for myself and also holding. But there is this concern that usually pop up in my head anytime I am meditating and that is what will happen if everyone is holding their bitcoin and no one is willing to sell. This can possibly happen in the future when mining reward becomes too small. I know some people will say that miners will continue to mine and sell to sustain their business but when there is reduced selling, will mining still be a profitable business?If this question appear dumb, please pardon me, I just need clarifications.

### Reply 1:
In as much as you think people aren't selling their bitcoin I will like to clear your doubt that people are heavily selling of their bitcoin, despite people using bitcoin as a store value or a reserved fund there are active people who are utilizing the purpose of bitcoin which is it's peer 2 peer values. So, always have this feeling that there are companies or institution who are paying their investors bitcoin or if they are ordering goods from other countries payment can be in bitcoin. I still need to draw your attention that people are trading bitcoin on forex, binary options and another broker out there so they need bitcoin for that to take effect. Wth all these I have explained tell how do you think no one will transact bitcoin?

### Reply 2:
First of all there will always be a trade of bitcoin as thats how the law of demand and supply works but should there be a stagnant position then the price will remain the same. After all bitcoin has been mined miners will have a reduce profit from the mining and so also as when there is a reduce sells or move of bitcoin from an address to address will also reduce the mining profits. But one thing is the hashrate will actually be reduced which is the reason why mining in the first place is expensive to run. But with everything at a low there wouldnt be need of high power to run it.

Topic: Struggle now to invest in Bitcoin for a bright future.
### Original post:
Many of us know about Bitcoin. But due to a lack of funds, we regret about Bitcoin investment. Many people, particularly those from low-income families, regret when we can't invest in Bitcoin. Though we can't solve this problem, we can struggle to achieve our goal. For our daily needs, we must need money to survive. Sometimes we spend money on unnecessary things. So we can avoid spending unnecessary money because we can survive without it. And we can start investing in Bitcoin with that money. We have to find a solid income source, even if it is small. So we can go ahead with our bitcoin investment. If we struggle now, we may build a bright future. Even students could save some money from their daily spending and invest in Bitcoin.

### Reply 1:
Thanks for the reminder, it's really difficult and majority of us here struggles with money or even to put food in the table for our family. But we all know that crypto gives us financial freedom, not a get rich quick scheme, as others might have seen it. Investing on it and making profits is not going to be easy. As there are a lot of factors and inherit risk.But if you master everything, or at least you have experience the ups and downs of the market itself, you will not regret the struggles early and then the reward of making profits in the future will be fulfilling and there will sense of satisfaction that you made the right decision.

### Reply 2:
I think it's getting harder to build a bright future by investing small amount of money in bitcoins because price is already too high to experience exponential rise. Bitcoin was the best investment option for poor people when its price was very low, probably under 1K but another problem here is that those who were poor, didn't have access to the internet.I think that what you say is easier to do for those who live in EU or at least have access to universal healthcare because it will help them in critical situations and holders won't have a need to touch their Bitcoin savings.By the way, transaction fees are so high that it's even harder for poor people to invest right now. I would say that centralized exchanges give you flexibility to invest an euro or two every day and buy some satoshis but exchange withdrawal fees are so high that it's meaningless. You probably have to risk to leave your funds on exchange if you try to frequently buy small quantity of bitcoins.

Topic: Pros and cons of using new Bitcoin addresses for each transaction?
### Original post:
Can someone please give me a list of the pros and cons of using new Bitcoin addresses for each transaction? It seems very inconvenient to use a new address each time.

### Reply 1:
basically the advantage of making a new address every time is anonymity.when you don't want anyone (who knows your old address, typically customers or, if you made it public potentially everyone) to recognize you that is a basic step you have to do.In my opinion there's no disadvantage except for the minimum raised work for clicking ""new address"".The only exception here is if you want to run a static account (like when you post the address to get donations), because afaik you can't reuse an address once you got a new one.

### Reply 2:
Is anonymity necessary for everyone? llama has his address in his signature. (I don't know if he changes his address though.) Can someone offer me a scenario where changing addresses would be a good idea?

This system intends to minimize the transaction fee (satoshis/byte), finalty times, and node storage requirements on the Bitcoin network, without a centralized architecture. By utilizing recent Bitcoin Taproot and Ethereum upgrades, transaction can be bundled into succinct zero-knowledge proofs on Layer Two Rollups, dramatically reducing the burden on the Bitcoin blockchain, leading to much faster, more affordable, and much less energy intensive transactions. Additionally, by utilizing Nostr compliant event signatures, a trusted and efficient way of storing large amounts of off-chain data, linked to on-chain transactions on the Bitcoin network can minimize the burden of regular Bitcoin node operators. This is accomplished through a series of already proven cryptographic techniques and audited smart contracts that impose proper behavior and protect against abuse. By integrating Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Nostr, this decentralized system makes every effort to revolutionize the cry<rest of post truncated>

running a wallet is not free that's why they have to earn profit from transactions and donations. If you cut off their commission or their way of earning money then I don't think you can use a wallet. Take electrum for example where many people have contributed to electrum like giving ideas and giving money through donations. Mempool congestion is not because of bitcoin system but because of a crypto created that uses bitcoin network and each transaction cause more transactions to be confirmed.

The question is where is this coming from, was it from the developers community or it's something you just come up with through your own personal research and findings?.

Topic: What are your predictions for the state of Bitcoin in 2024?
### Original post:
Since 2022, the value of Bitcoin has begun to fall. Following that, 2023 was a much worse year; in late 2003, a new version of Bitcoin was released. Furthermore, the market is gradually improving and stabilising. By 2024, we expect a slow recovery from our Bitcoin downturn. In the near future, it will also bring us good news. Things will get better with time. Do you think Bitcoin will be superior by 2024? Please share your thoughts.

### Reply 1:
It is true that 2022 was bearish for bitcoin, but opposite was the case in 2023 becuase the price of bitcoin at the beginning of 2023 was $16500 but ended with almost $45000. Which means 2023 was a bull run year. Even if 2003 was a typo, no new bitcoin was released or created.Bitcoin has always been superior. But if you mean that bitcoin will increase more in 2024? Just hold and not sell, bitcoin price did increased after halving in the past. If spot bitcoin ETF is approved by United States SEC, this can also be positive for bitcoin.

### Reply 2:
Bitcoin's superiority is not determined by the price but the network. 1BTC is always equal to 1BTC and the network functions the same way right from when it first went online. When the price drops it gives you an opportunity to buy more at a discounted price.Hownlow do you think fiat will drop in 2024?

Topic: Satoshis Memoir Part 1
### Original post:
Satoshis Memoir Part 1Ive always been better with code than words. I felt now was a safe time to start clearing up some of the speculation around Bitcoin and how it came to be.The phone rings. There was no way of knowing this would be the catalyst which would lead to the creation of Bitcoin. It was 1994 and my life was about to change forever.I picked up the phone, my father is on the other line asking if I called 911. He said there is a police officer at the house saying someone called 911. I told him I didnt and Ive been on the internet all day and playing Doom. He said the police officer wants everyone in the house to come outside to ask about the 911 call and make sure everyone is safe. I found this very strange, why didnt they just call back if someone called from the house?I try to wake up my sister to get her downstairs, my attempts were futile. Its the middle of the afternoon in the summer, why would she be awake.I grab my full trashcan sitting next to my computer desk and bring it with me. My dad and the police officer are in the two-car garage with one door is open. When I enter the garage, I dump my small trashcan full of floppy disks into the trash compactor and turn it<rest of post truncated>

If you needed to know about Satoshi mindset, go through the whitepaper and read to understand everything that was written there, aside this, am less concerned about any other discovery which may also talks about Satoshi or any other story about himself, what we needed is Bitcoin and not even the Satoshi himself and he has done us the very best in giving us what we actually want, maybe that was part of the reasons to his disappearance, who can tell, I may not just have that time in going through the whole full page reading about what you posted when the summary of what's being needed are given on the whitepaper.

### Reply 2:
I'm not sure if I'm the only one who read this till the last word, but I think it's worth reading. As a newbie to the crypto space, I never knew Satoshi had documented such an interesting detailed work history, or is it just a fictional story? His work has indeed brought great change to the financial sector, though we are battling with those in authority. In case there is a particular site to read more of his documentation, please kindly share.

be careful of the fools game of sudden admiration...ive used the analogy before.. (comparing bitcoin economy to wheat farm economy)monsantoGMO said natural wheat is ripe for disease.. monsanto got involved in wheat commoditiestheir creation of GMO wheat is not about suddenly adoring natural family farmed wheat. they just want to control the wheat commodity and have lobbied the EPA to make organic wheat be pressured into higher standards. where old fashioned farmed natural wheat is obliterated by industrial farming of GMO crops that then sue if GMO gets mixed with natural by family farmsnow back to realityhis support of a bitcoin ETF is not the same as supporting real bitcoin transactions on the bitcoin networki guarantee you guys like dimon and fink will both claim their locked custody coins are the clean harvest which people can invest in. whilst then claiming circulating coins on the network are the plague ridden crop no one should touchthey dont think of themselves as bitcoin users. they want to control the upper echelons of international markets. and see the natural form be treated as the enemy/competition taking customers away from their investments.

### Reply 2:
People change according to their circumstances, and that's true in this case as well. Lary Fink claimed that Bitcoin is used for money laundering in past and now he's into it. It means that back then he wasn't sure that Bitcoin could be a profitable asset for his fund but now he understands that Bitcoin is not only profitable for his fund but in fact a game changer in the world of technological revolution. Many ignorant people still consider Bitcoin as a scam but with the passage of time they will understand that whatever they were thinking about Bitcoin was totally wrong and they will regret for their ignorance. In starting many people considered Bitcoin as another Ponzi scheme now they all have huge holdings of Bitcoin. That's why they say that people change their minds when they understand the truth.

Topic: Found spare change down the back of the sofa.....bitcoin style
### Original post:
I started with BitCoin over 6 months ago(possibly longer, I don't recall) and for a period of at least a week had both crappy computers in the home running it, generating. I had made 1000BTC. And then got bored, being in China there's not much I can do with BTC. And did a re-install of my machine.So I forgot all about it until about 2 weeks ago when I came across Bitcoin again, and started up again. Only to find that after 2 weeks I have generated NO coins And I was thinking that I'm going to be BTC poor forever when I just remembered. I had made a backup. After checking it was still there, my wallet with my BTC1000 and I was so happy.Just thought I'd share that story. On a slightly related note; with a AMD Athalon X2(dual core) machine how long will I have to wait to generate some bitcoins? And should I feel rich now that I've got my BTC1000 back again (whats that worth in paper money?).

### Reply 1:
That is some progress in a few months, it makes me sad that I did not keep the generation up when I first started, now I must work for my BTC like all the commoners ~$250 wow.... that is the single best investment I have made in my life, that's nearly a months salary. And my family called me an idiot dreamer for playing around with this! HA HA I shall show them.

### Reply 2:
Guess the best thing for you to generate coins is to join a pooled mining effort.

I propose that we adopt the Thai baht currency symbol, , as the official bitcoin currency symbol and BTC as the official bitcoin three letter currency code.

### Reply 1:
There's nothing wrong with multiple currencies using the same symbol. Many different currencies use the dollar sign, $. The ampersand, &, already has many very well defined meanings, including multiple uses as a prefix. It absolutely is not a currency symbol and using it as such would cause a lot more confusion than using an already existent obscure currency symbol. There is a generic currency symbol, , which I considered using until I noticed the very beautiful . You can type in Ubuntu by pressing Ctrl-Shift-U 0E3F and in Windows by pressing Alt 0E3F. I will be using it and I hope it catches on.

### Reply 2:
I guess if we need to make it a bit more distinguishable then we could adopt the italic version.

Topic: The Debate: Should Your Business Accept Bitcoin?
### Original post:
Hey Crypto Crew,So, I've been pondering the whole ""Should Your Business Accept Bitcoin?"" conundrum. Some say it's the future, while others think it's just a fad. What's your take on this crypto rollercoaster? Share your thoughts on whether diving into the Bitcoin sea is a savvy move or a shipwreck waiting to happen. Personally, I'm torn between embracing the digital gold rush and sticking to the good ol' cash. Let's chat about the pros, cons, and the downright unpredictable nature of this crypto beast. Are you ready to sail the Bitcoin waves or prefer to anchor in traditional waters? Drop your two satoshis below and let's hash it out!

### Reply 1:
This is a much different question from the one in your topic title. Bitcoin can be the future but is not right as a means of payment for your business.15 years down the road, I'll say fiat is more of the shipwreck waiting to happen, but it's still better for SMEs as a means of payment than BTC.Do your personal analysis for your business; Is it an online or offline business? Is there a demand for an alternative means of payment? Is there any limitation using your current payment method? If you accept Bitcoin, do you plan to hodl it or convert to fiat immediately?

### Reply 2:
I will consider bitcoin payment in the future, wherein I think Most people are engaging in this digital money but for now? I will stick to the traditional way of payment. I know that it depends to a nature of the business but come to think if it, Not all person has a bitcoin or aware about it especiamly those elders so We should consider them especially that they are your costumers.

Topic: Possibility of collision
### Original post:
The bitcoin vs the state thread got me thinking about how small of a chance we are talking about.Please rank the following in the order of likeliness:A: You thoroughly shuffle a deck of cards into its original order.B: A normal 6 year old girl who never bowled before bowls a perfect game 10 times in a row.C: A MLB baseball pitcher strikes out every batter he faces in a season.D: Tiger Woods gets a hole in one for every par 3 he faces in a year.E: A person wins 5 Powerball lotteries in a row (Say 80,000,000:1 against each)F: A bitcoin address collision is discovered in the next 20 years using most modern technology.If the 'atoms in the universe' rule is true, my guess:A, D, B, C, E, F.

### Reply 1:
A is not 1 in 52. assuming that a ""shuffling"" produces a random ordering of the cards, you randomly produce 1 out of the 52! possible orderings of the 52 cards. that's 52 factorial, not ""52 excited exclamation"". which comes out to roughly 8.0658175170945e+67 - that's 8 with 67 zeros following it.now, let's get back to our regularly scheduled programming. EDIT: sorry, i completely missed the ! after /your/ 52 and thought you said ""1 in 52"". my bad. i must be getitng blind in my old age.

### Reply 2:
It's not. There are approximately 10^80 atoms in the universe. On the other hand, as said there, there are 2^160, or 1.46x10^48 possible addresses. So the number of atoms in the universe is nearly the number of bitcoin addresses multiplied by... the number of bitcoin addresses! Not quite the same, really.I'm not saying a collision is more probable than the rest of your examples, though. It's just that people are starting to repeat this atom thing just because they read someone else repeating it in another thread.

Topic: Exchange Bitcoin Key
### Original post:
Why isn't there a strategy to grab the private key from the exchange. After all the bitcoins are mine. Are there ways to do this? As in, in case something happens to the exchange like Mt Gox. Why is the key accessible to a hacker but not to the owner of the coin? Why are there no exchanges giving users private keys?

### Reply 1:
Yeah, though I'm thinking along the line in case the hacker didn't steal from all the wallets like Mt Gox. Mine could be one of the unaccessed wallets and I wouldn't have to wait 10 years to get my coins.

### Reply 2:
I think exchanges make use of some kind of wallet that generates multiple bitcoin wallet addresses, which could be enough to allocate funds to their customers. Each address is attached to a particular account, and when deposited, they can see it in their account. The exchange has access to this wallet, but the customers don't. This is the only way they can control the funds from their end.If hackers want to hack an exchange, they target the wallet or how to penetrate their data base and initiate withdrawals from their wallet, so it's not an individual account that's being hacked but that of the exchange wallet that is being penetrated.Maybe they have 10 or more cold wallets where they authorise their withdrawals; if one is being emptied, the others will still be safe, but you can tell which user fund is being touched and which is not touched because they send almost all user funds to their safe.

Topic: Power Of Bitcoin
### Original post:
Cryptocurrency is slowly taking over the world and some hotels are now accepting Bitcoin as means of payment and Bulgaria as a country owns the highest Bitcoin as a country.Around 2018 a friend of mine bought some unit of Bitcoin equivalent to $1,000 and also advise me to do same but I refused and was skeptical about it because I was of the notion that ""what is really moving is coin of a currency"" fast-forward 4 years later my friends share or unit of Bitcoin skyrocketed to $10,000 and I was at thr losing end just to be left with the thought of had I know.When Bitcoin first broke out there was a man Laszlo who exchanged $10,000 worth of Bitcoin for two Papa John's Pizza from Jeremy but fast-forward to today Jeremy can purchase a million pack of pizza worth $10000 and still have more BTC left for him .Nevertheless me falling short of the first opportunity of buying Bitcoin I'm still hoping of an opportunity to present it self so I can get the little bit of Bitcoin to my custody and I also advise both my friends and enemies to buy as much cryptocurrency they can because cryptocurrency is the currency of the future.

### Reply 1:
At one point in time we all have our own time when we were skeptical about it, and we missed out on the early opportunity to acquire it more earlier, but we lost it, due to our distrust then, but we won't sit by and keep on crying, we just have to make every opportunity count, by buying BTC through the DCA method because we are still in the early days of the rise of Bitcoin.

### Reply 2:
Don't waste your time again, Just buy now and hodle. Op people are still predicting that Bitcoin will reach $100,000 in the next bull market and now Bitcoin is still $45k therefore you still have the chance to invest in it. If you have the $1,000 invest in it now that is still on the low key. And it is said by someone here, everyone was skeptical at the first encounter of the technology or the project because many were afraid to loss their money to scammers or others. Well I can't say much about Bulgaria Bitcoin status because I have not heard of it. But in Nigeria, we are the giant in Bitcoin in Africa. Yes cryptocurrency will take over the digital world but it can't the physical. And cryptocurrency might even influence the exchange rate of the fiat currencies in the world.

Topic: make bitcoin.org available on i2p
### Original post:
I was wondering how practical it is to make bitcoin.org available on i2p. The address bitcoin.i2p is still available and it would allow users to use the site when it is eventually blocked by (insert your favorite dictatorial regime here *mine is China*).Actually most if not all services for bitcoin should be made available on i2p for when they are eventually blocked by various governments around the world. Already a number of exchanges are available on i2p(it is even mentioned on the list of services available on i2p's most popular wiki.It is only a matter of time as bitcoin is already illegal in a number of countries (although it has not been banned it's existence and purpose of use violates the law), it will only require it's discovery by the wrong law official for them to take notice of it.

### Reply 1:
So a simple site on i2p copying some from bitcoin.org and having the bitcoin client available for download would be ok?

### Reply 2:
Ooops, it looks like something is not working, this is something that I threw up 5 minuts before rushing out.

Topic: The Role of Cryptocurrency in Cybersecurity
### Original post:
Ever wondered if cryptocurrency is the unsung hero in the realm of cybersecurity? It's like the quiet friend who always has your back. Cryptocurrencies, with their decentralized nature, seem to be throwing a subtle shade at the vulnerabilities of traditional financial systems. No big banks holding all the keys here! Just the distributed ledger silently doing its thing. It's like having a covert agent safeguarding your transactions.In a world where data breaches are as common as morning coffee, cryptocurrencies stand tall, offering a layer of anonymity and security. It's not just about making transactions; it's about doing it securely, like your own financial superhero. So, next time you send some crypto flying across the blockchain, give a nod to the unsung defender in the cybersecurity arena. It might just be the coolest thing since sliced bread, but way more secure. What's your take on this silent cybersecurity crusader?

### Reply 1:
The Cybersecurity on blockchain and cryptos is really solid, and that's because it is an opensource project. Since everyone has access to the code some white hat hackers have made big improvements in this area. But that doesn't mean it hasn't been exploited in the past. A good example is the incident in 2010, it was known as the ""value Overflow Incident"", and one user was able to send 184.467 billion bitcoins. But Satoshi Nakamoto see the transaction, forked the block and patched the code with the help of Gaving Andresen and other Devs.

### Reply 2:
I would rather say that crypto currency is the biggest friend of the cyber criminals. Majority of the international money heists are done using cryptocurrency. Exactly due to the decentralized nature, it is next to impossible to recover stolen funds. All ransomware attackers take ransomes in cryptocurrencies. So decentralized nature of a cryptocurrency comes with multiple negative points as well. While cryptos are more secured, it also comes with anonymity. Which is greatly helping the cyber criminals to siphon their funds to an unknown location. What is your thought about that?

Topic: How does Bitcoin work?
### Original post:
Hi everyone, I am new to this forum, but I have been reading the technical paper behind bitcoin and while I like many of its claimed properties, I would like to see something with a bit more explanation, as I am used from reading other cryptographic papers, which while dense can at least be shown to be wrong. To be able to analyze a system mathematically you need the equations. Pointing at the source code is not a substitute for that. In a paper I shouldn't be the one who has to figure out why something is true; there should be proofs and a stupid computer should be able to follow it.I am surprised you already got this far, since I would have expected people to demand that the system is solid first, before using it. Next to the mathematical points there is also the issue of someone discovering a constructive method to generate blocks. Is there a way to switch to a different hash function if so required?There is another efficiency issue: how much energy or machine operations of the whole network does it cost to verify one transaction? If it costs more to verify a microtransaction than its value, there seems to be something wrong; it might be that this is a fundamental limitation. A <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
There are several threads that have been talking about this specific issue, and it is something under consideration. There is a plan in place to deal with the possibility that the SHA-256 algorithm, which is the one currently being used by Bitcoins, would eventually be replaced. There is also an effort by the NSA and others involve with the cryptology community in general (much more than just Bitcoins) that is trying to find something more secure than this algorithm and put it through a rigorous analysis in terms of ensuring that it really is more secure.This thread goes into much more detail about this issue and includes a quote from the lead developer that is relevant to you question:<link> terms of the ability to verify a transaction is valid, the effort to do that is trivial, on the order of a few cycles and a fraction of a second for even an ordinary computer. The transactions get incorporate into the hash blocks in terms of getting put into the network and recorded on a ""permanent"" basis as having been confirmed. In this regard a considerable amount of effort is put into confirming the transactions and in fact is one of the major functions that is ""rewarded"" by giving those n<rest of post truncated>

### Original post:
With the vast improvement of technology across our world, finances, cryptocurrency, AI and even in the communication sector right now, from the time of 2G to 5G which is widely in use right now, our mobile phones, laptops, network servers now operate on 5G network with its high speed, high bandwidth, low latency and other improvement. 5G has shown great positive effects on the across the technology of our time, given at the speed in which, data is been generated and processed. I like to think this will help boost the Bitcoin network, I tend to believe Bitcoin servers are now running on 5G which will help Bitcoiners in terms of as per:1) Network congestion: With 5G now the network congestion has reduced because of its high speed processing power which would therefore aid the rate at which, Bitcoin miners and the entire Blockchain network carryout its activities with less stress. Which in turn saves time while increasing efficiency.2)It would also ensure safety of data been stored in the network since it connects various devices at a time.3)It would also save cost, like some people interested in running Bitcoin core nodes can now access it without those secluded devices, with bigger <rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Although this is Bitcoin related but it's not solely a technical discussion, I believe it fits some where else not here particularly. The attributes of the 5G network which you have mentioned above is quiet not true statements in regards to how it will help the Bitcoin network. although it will increase the user experience of global internet users but it's not a ground for the attributes you mention.You can read of Bitcoin network congestion [1] how it work, what causes them etc. to get aquatinted with the knowledge hence Bitcoin network connection is caused by factors like high rate of transactions (increase in Bitcoin adoption), cost of transaction fee, lastly size of transaction, each transaction on bitcoin network has a limit of 1 MB and when transactions are higher 1mb it takes more space in the block thereby causing reduction in transaction process which may lead to increase in tx fee. [1] <link>

### Reply 2:
Another obvious nonsense on technical board.No correlation. Congestion happen mainly due to block time, block size limit and how many transaction created by Bitcoiner.You mistook data safety with data availability. Besides, there are already many Bitcoin full node out there.While 5G generally offer better speed, the actual cost depends on your provider. If they charge high cost for 4G connection, i don't expect 5G will make it far cheaper.If you refer to ""confirmation time"" when you say ""speed"", block size limit and block time have far bigger role compared with hashrate and difficulty.

Topic: What happens when network is split for prolonged time and reconnected?
### Original post:
Suppose that BitCoins are being widely used all across the globe. Suppose that all internet connections between two countries are blocked (eg China and US go to war) and people still engage in transactions inside each network. Now all transactions within each network are broadcasted to all nodes inside its network, but not to the other network. Within each network, the longest chain in each would be considered valid, and the BitCoin economy would continue to exist inside each network.Now after several years existing independently, what happens when the two networks are reconnected?

### Reply 1:
Maybe they won't be reconnected. Instead, we will effectively have two currencies. This will lead to the creation of an Eastern-Western bitcoin currency exchange market(s).

### Reply 2:
It does not require an entity to know what happen if the design of the bitcoin network didn't anticipated this kind of event. If it does happen anyway, than it may or may not be intended to deal with it.

Topic: Gary Gensler: ""Bitcoin is not that decentralized""
### Original post:
In a recent interview with SEC chairman Gary Gensler, there was something that caught my attention. The chairman stated that ""Bitcoin is not that decentralized"". That's ""partially due to the prominence of centralized crypto exchanges"". You can read all about it here: <link> afraid he's right, especially when CEXs hold most of BTC's circulating supply (eg: Binance). It's even worse now with the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC. Institutional investment companies like BlackRock, VanEck, and MicroStrategy are accumulating large amounts of the cryptocurrency. We're essentially selling our BTC to companies driven by mainstream governments' own interests. With this, Bitcoin's true value proposition has failed (banks win). At least, the code is open source. If BTC becomes compromised, what's stopping us from moving to a more decentralized chain in the future (Litecoin, Monero)?Your input would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

Bitcoin is <truncated> exchanges and Bitcoin ETF which are centralized are not part of what that makes up the bitcoin network. If we are talking about bitcoin, we should be talking about the network and noncustodial wallets.No, he knows that bitcoin is decentralized but centralized exchanges and other centralized ways of holding bitcoin by other users are centralized is what he was talking about.

### Reply 2:
The network may be <truncated> what happens when big companies, governments, and institutions accumulate all of the BTC (or at least, most of it)? Without people ""owning"" BTC (self custody), the blockchain will become the sole playground of the aforementioned entities. I could be wrong, though.

Topic: Bitcoin header help...
### Original post:
So... I was going through the CPUMiner code (... YES, I know CPU mining is dead, I'm just using this code as an educational way to learn how BTC blocks and transactions are assembled) and was wondering about these two lines: work->data[20] = 0x80000000; work->data[31] = 0x00000280;in the block header setup. Any idea why these values are important to set? From reading the BTC specs, I thought the header padding from +20 onwards was all supposed to be 0's..?So confused newbie to the bowels of BTC... any help appreciated, thanks.

### Reply 1:
Brilliant, thank you. I had no clue these were SHA256 <truncated> I really appreciate it, thanks!

### Reply 2:
This looks like SHA256 related values.The first one 0x80 is the SHA-2 specific padding used at the end of the message (1 followed by m 0)[1].The second one (0x0280) is the message length in bits added at the end of the final [SHA2] block. We have an 80-byte header so 80 byte message * 8 = 640 bits or 0x0280[1] <link>

Topic: The topic of Bitcoin's Achievement is charming
### Original post:
Even though I've used BTC Achieved previously, I had yet to learn that BTC would reach such heights. But at the time, I was confident that BTC would improve. But could the query that emerged within truly get to it at a favorable angle? Then, after much research, I discovered that it would have a favorable position and be the only coin to outperform all the others. The price of Bitcoin was meager in 2013 when I purchased some.Key highlights of 2013:In 2013, the value of Bitcoin increased by +5,575%, peaking at $1,156 in December.Highest price: $1,156Lowest price: $13.30The price at the start of 2013 was $13.30Price at the end of 2013: $755This is when my bitcoin arrived. It would have been better if I had held that lovely moment. But I was unable to succeed. I stumbled but didn't break. It was unimaginable then that the price would increase by so much.I had yet to learn that I would get Bitcoin in this manner in 2024. However, I did what I thought I could. You'll be pleased to learn that I succeeded in this circular game by honing my cunning. Even though I had previously received Bitcoin, this time was different. Right now, my passion is fulfilled. I also own bitcoin. I hope, someth<rest of post truncated>

I want to disagree but this is totally true, past records isn't a good way to predict the future but my mind keeps telling me that bitcoin has a pattern and that it's not going to be deviating from that pattern and it just going to happen the same way again but at a much higher level. I disagree that the illegal stuff has gone down, maybe in bitcoin but there's definitely more people that's using crypto for really nefarious stuff. I don't think stability will ever be a thing for bitcoin though, I still believe it's going to be volatile as ever, that's one thing I believe will never change.

### Reply 2:
Well, I know that it's a quite happy moment for the ones who learnt about Bitcoin in its early days and kept holding their Bitcoin from those years but in current times we would also need to think about those people who are trying their best to accumulate some Bitcoin.I'm happy to see that you have shared your story with us and I hope it will be helpful to inspire all those people who are accumulating Bitcoin on weekly or monthly basis by following some kind of a DCA strategy. You're among the lucky ones and there are many such people who have got Bitcoin when it was cheaper and now holding it in hopes that it will reach $1M per coin. I hope that Bitcoin will surely amaze us when we see its price at $1M, and by then many holders will have financial freedom.

Topic: Sustained transaction averages above 170 per hour.
### Original post:
I see that, according to bitcoinwatch.com, that the average transactions per hour is above 170 per hour, ringing in at about 22 per block. It was not so long ago that the average was less than 20 per hour, counting the award transactions. I think that this shows that there is a grey market of vendors unknown to the forum, and that is much of what has been driving up the market price.

Topic: How much generating power is sufficient?
### Original post:
Taking a step back from the discussions about incentives for generators to ask the question: How much hashing power is actually needed? More is of course better, all else equal, but how much is sufficient?First, what is it good for? Preventing double spending. If the difficulty is high enough that it costs more to generate a (chain of) block(s) that omits a payment made than the payment itself is worth then double spending fraud is unprofitable. That's it.There is more to profit from reverting big transactions than small, so the larger the transaction the more blocks the recipient has to wait until considering it confirmed.For most practical purposes the difficulty won't need to be more than about the worth of a used car per block. Transactions higher in value than that are generally made over longer time, between known participants writing contracts and don't have to rely on the Bitcoin protection anyway.Currently the difficulty should be worth about 50 BTC/block, considering that the block reward is 50 BTC and most generators do it for profit. That's a bit small if you're selling a 20 000 BTC car and have to wait two days for the transaction to be confirmed.But the eye watering b<rest of post truncated>

The problem: Bitcoin allows you to make anonymous or nearly-anonymous payments, but you must reveal your identity if you wish to have physical goods delivered to you in exchange.Solution: The anonymous dropbox depot.How it works: XYZ, Inc., an above-board firm, establishes a physical point of presence (depot) in a metropolitan area. The XYZ facility has a number of lockboxes, each with a digital keypad lock, the combination of which can be changed remotely by the firm's computers. On the front of each lockbox is a digital display, also remotely reprogrammable, which indicates the box number. You wish to order an item from NewAmazon, which accepts BTC as payment. Here is the process:1. Visit XYZ's website and obtain a unique box number.2. Place your order on NewAmazon, pay for it with BTC, and specify the shipping address as:XYZ, Inc.123 Main St.Box 1234 (the number you got from XYZ's website)Your city, etc.3.

Is there a roadmap in place for future development of Bitcoin?

This flat file format should be encrypted natively (though people can choose to embed it in another encryption format, thereby providing double encryption).* Full security audit of BitcoinThis will be needed in order to provide a measure of trust.* Increased anonymity/privacy featuresSimply integrating with Tor/I2P, like BitTorrent programs allow, should help.

If I am correct, Bitcoin *can* work with only the last block. If I'm not, correct me!But this is insecure because if that last block isn't verified, it might be bogus!Every block is signed with the previous block. (Or something like that. I'm not an expert on the algorithm.)So, if you don't have block 10, you can't verify if 11 is valid, you first need 10 for that, and to verify 10, you need 9, and so on.When Bitcoin starts, it begins downloading the genesis block, and verifying it, and continues down the line checking all blocks and saving them. It's like a linked chain!Eventually every block in existence has been checked and saved, and right now that's like 27 megabytes.The block downloading mechanism isn't that fast. If I am correct it writes the whole file to the harddrive everytime -- or maybe just one sector -- when it gets a new block, so it'll write 65000 times to your hard drive... not exactly what you call 'nice'.I have a solution.Anyhow, does Bitcoin need all the blocks to function? YesCan we hardcode a block into Bitcoin to save time? Sorta, we don't want to download just from that hardcoded block on.

I am all for promoting bitcoin but I wish to offer some friendly critique about the post on the other forum. Through personal experience I have found attempting to promote something on other forums is a tricky business. One has to remember forum owners, moderators and users are generally very possessive creatures - they hate marketing or external sites, especially if it sounds like marketing.There is nothing wrong with the article on the other forum, if it was published on a site which accepts articles. Within the context of a forum where everyone has a voice, and everyone has something to say, whether it is worth saying or not, one has to use more tact to push others in the direction you wish them to follow. On a forum or discussion group one has to use the one power open to you - the reader's opinion and ego. The readers in these media often want to say something, they don't like to be ""preached"" or ""marketed"" to. The simple way to achieve this is to spark debate with a simple post like:""I came across this open source project at www.bitcoin.org which seems interesting.

Topic: We should be looking only at the brighter side
### Original post:
Being a Bitcoin investor or a holder comes without it's own ups and downs that makes us want to sell off all of it without looking back, but know one thing, their is actually a light, at the end of the tunnel, we should not be looking at the higher transaction fees, the network congestion, the complications and effort needed to hold perfectly without you selling due to financial pressure, the negativity and speculation around it by hater, the stress and measures put in place to secure it well from scammers, but as a true Bitcoineers, we should only be look at the brighter and the bigger picture of how much you stand to gain, if you keeps on holding, look only at the brighter side of it, because that's what going to motivate you when you feel tired, cheer to all Bitcoineer

No investment comes with risk free. Every business has it's own risk and crypto isn't an exception here. Anyone looking at the risk in business can never become an investor. One just need to learn how to minimize the risk in any business one is planning to do. That is why is important to learn about crypto before investing in it. This will help you to manage your risk.

These two wiki articles explain most of the basics:<link> send a transaction, you say:I was the recipient of this (or these) <truncated> transactions. Here's a cryptographic signature to prove it. Change the owner of x coins from my public key to this person's public key. Then they can prove that they own this transaction by making a cryptographic signature, and so on.

Topic: Bitcoin ETF Hype and Leverage
### Original post:
Hey fellow crypto enthusiasts, I wanted to share a personal experience that I believe holds valuable lessons for all of us. Recently, I found myself drawn into the excitement surrounding a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) and decided to explore the potential gains using leverage. Unfortunately, my journey ended with a loss of 2 BTC.This serves as a reminder for all of us in the crypto community: caution is paramount. Cryptocurrency investments are renowned for their volatility, and the allure of quick profits can sometimes lead to equally swift losses. It's essential to approach such opportunities with a discerning eye and an understanding of the risks involved.Here's what I've gleaned from my own experience:Thorough Research Matters: Dive deep into the specifics of your investments. Understand the market, the cryptocurrency involved, and any associated financial instruments. Knowledge is your best defense.Hype Can be Deceptive: Crypto markets are often influenced by hype. It's important not to let market sentiment alone dictate your decisions. Always balance excitement with a solid grasp of the fundamentals.Manage Your Risks: Leverage can magnify both gains and losses. Only inve<rest of post truncated>

IDK man, the halving & ETF news seemed too big to miss the train

### Reply 2:
In the end, the ETF was just priced in and the shorters were proven right, but that's only after BTCUSD reached a scam whick of epic proportions liquidating most of the shorts in the process. It just goes to show that when a market has high speculation, there will be high price fluctuations also. Shorting or longing BTC based on logic makes little sense. All leveraged positions will be targeted to be forced into closing one way or another. And the high leverage offered on crypto exchanges, as well as the amount of traders with no idea of what they're doing, makes BTC just an easier target for whales to manipulate the markets as they wish.

The burning question here is what job are all three of these characters applying for?

### Reply 2:
I don't have a Koan for you but I can tell you a joke.Three men are waiting for an interview. The first is called in. The interviewer learns that the first man is a mathematician. As the interview is wrapping up, the inerviewer says ""Now before you go, I have one last question. What's 1+1?"". ""Exactly 2"" says the mathematician. Next, the interviewer calls in the second man, who is an engineer. Towards the end of the interview, again, he says ""One last question. What's 1+1?"". ""Well..."" says the engineer ""that depends on the accuracy of the original measurement. So I'd say around 2, plus or minus some amount of error"".Finally, the interviewer calls in the third man, who is a lawyer. Again, at the end of the interview, he asks ""One final question - what's 1+1?"". The lawyer gets up from his seat and goes over the nearby window and closes the shades. He sits back down, and looks plainly into the interviewer's eyes: ""What do you want it to be?""

Topic: Microstrategy Acquires 14,620 Bitcoin, Don't get carried away.
### Original post:
As of 26 December, while others were celebrating Christmas with various activities, Microstrategy were celebrating theirs with further addition of 14,620 Bitcoin which worth $615M. Since their start in August 2020, Microstrategy has bought a total of 189,150 BTC. It's certainly uncertain if Michael Saylor is slowing down soon, given his understanding of the importance of long term investment in Bitcoin. Microstrategy's current Bitcoin accumulation worth over $5B, which guarantees a very good profit in the next Bull market and beyond.Despite all this positive news, I suggest we shouldn't get carried away. Microstrategy has introduced a strategy of continuos purchase of Bitcoin. Why don't we do the same. As respective crypto ethusiast, continuous accumulation is also required, no matter the amount.What do you think?

### Reply 1:
If we are to work with the figure you just gave above as the total amount of Bitcoin Microstrategy currently has @ 189,150 BTC, then I think with the current price of Bitcoin at $43,100 per BTC, then it's accumulative worth is actually more than $5B, as it's currently up to $8B (i.e 189,150 x $43,100 = $8,152,365,000). Hence, this should be a sign for us all to keep accumulating ours just as Microstrategy has done theirs, if we really wants to reap good profit after the price of Bitcoin start skyrocketing after next year's halving.

### Reply 2:
Everyone can invest the amount they want, no one can interfere with this, but we cannot ignore the risks of high amounts of investment. Microstrategy's purchase of Bitcoin and keeping it on the agenda is good news for Bitcoin, but this situation may also reverse in the future. What I mean is that if a person or institution holds a large amount of Bitcoin and starts selling it in the future, this will inevitably affect the market negatively. There's nothing to prevent this.Institutions and companies that purchase Bitcoin have a significant impact on increasing the price of Bitcoin and diversifying their investors. While talking about the positive aspects of such investors, we should also be aware of the negative situation that will arise in case of sale.

Topic: Possible deflation problem?
### Original post:
Hi,What do you think about future deflation problem? Just imagine: if bitcoin will be really, really popular and all of 21 millions will be shared between its users...there are will be a deflation. At first time it will not cause many problems, but later or sooner there are will be collapse of bitcoin. Because prices cannot decrease all the time. System will just collapse, its crazy to think its okay to pay 0.000001BTC for something like an airplane, haha (what will happen if someone will find 500 BTC on his old wallet? He will be able to buy the whole world?)

### Reply 1:
I don't know what bitcoins eventual userbase will be. However I cannot imagine deflation ever reaching the level ArtemZ describes. The reason being that if the smallest possible denomination (which I am going to call an itty bit) becomes too valuable it ceases to be useful. If I cannot buy bread or milk with bitcoins, or pay my electricity bill, or make other small purchases I am going to transform bitcoins into other currency in order to do so. When I transform bitcoins into other currencies I am reducing the demand for bitcoins and this drives the prices down. Now currently I can't do those things with bitcoins, and I am not liquidating all my bitcoins to do so, but that is because i only have a very small amount of bitcoins, and I expect them to appreciate in value. If I had a large amount of bitcoins (and in ArtemZ's scenario one itty bit is a large amount because it has large purchasing power) I would want to exchange part of it even if I expected it to increase in value because it would not be of any use to me. Bitcoins value is determined by their usefulness.

### Reply 2:
Just saying, if we will ever reach 21 million users, there were a potential budget of 1BTC for every user.Of course there will be rich one with several thousand coins and poor ones with only a thousandth of a BTC.Actually it isn't 21,000,000 fix units of bitcoins but 21,000,000,000,000 units of a millionth of a BTC.And i think there's the option to make them even more divisible (not sure about this), so deflation is not a problem here.-EDITED-

Topic: Here's why BCH/BSV lovers constantly attack BTC...
### Original post:
They do not believe in free market economics (letting the free market decide which chain is more valuable).Free market dictates that the BTC blockchain is the most valuable in terms of token value AND hashrate amount (security).They do not like the fact that big block chains (BSV, BCH) have miniscule hashrate compared to BTC, which makes them prone to 51% attacks:<link> inside their heart they know that BTC is the only true Bitcoin, therefore they try to change it as they see fit.They already have what they want (big blocks in forked/worthless chains), but not in their preferred chain (BTC). I hope this clears up the whole situation.

### Reply 1:
I use to hear people say this that what you cant become, then you become jealous of it, that is the same explanation needed in making an interpretation between bitcoin and BCH, anything that is not like the way we are are, cannot perform the same role we play, their fork is not a complete victory that they have gained access over what bitcoin is to the people and the economy, that is why BCH is nowhere to be found wherever bitcoin appears.

### Reply 2:
The average person has heard of bitcoin, but the average person has never heard of BCH, BSV, ethereum, etc. Most people will tell you they have heard of bitcoin when asked but will say no if you ask them about ethereum or any other altcoin.It has been 6 years since I got into crypto and I still struggle to think of anything useful you can do with ethereum other than buying stupid NFTs, running scam projects and rugpulls. Bitcoin is a household name. No other crypto has such name recognition because everything else is worthless centralized garbage.

Topic: Zitcoins
### Original post:
A friend asked me a question recently: what if one day someone invents a new electronic currency that is similar to Bitcoin, but better in some way? Lets call this new currency Zitcoin (for juvenile comedic effect). His point was that this would devalue the Bitcoin overnight as everyone moved to the new currency.However, I believe this is completely false. I think that the value of Bitcoins is not JUST in their engineered properties. It is also through their wide use and acceptance. Therefore, my expectation is that Zitcoins may eventually overtake Bitcoins, but it would take a long time for Zitcoins to be widely accepted.A good analogy to this is mp3 audio vs ogg audio. Ogg is newer and superior to mp3, and yet mp3 is literally *everywhere*, whereas almost no-one uses ogg. Why? Because one of the *properties* of mp3 is its universal usage. Ogg may eventually overtake mp3, but it would take a long time, and certainly not be a cut and dry instant process.Thoughts?

### Reply 1:
Yeah, if the new one was identical it would be vastly inferior because bitcoin is, as you say, already being used.If it was a little better maybe it would get adopted for some niche uses. Maybe it validates faster and some people really need that or something else.It would have to be way better to abandon bitcoin completely and quickly. But this isn't a bad thing, being allowed to stop using a currency if something better comes along is good.

### Reply 2:
Really this is not quite as intuitive as it seems. Suppose I started a currency just like bitcoin (zitcoin is an ok name) and say I got Satoshi to mod the standard client so everyone who trades bitcoins could trade zitcoins as well. They didn't have to if they didn't want to. But it would be trivial to send either or both.So now let's say I could control the minting rate of zitcoins dynamically. So I manipulate the quantity so that it would trade at parity with bitcoins. At least for a while. But as a general policy, I decide that zitcoins would remain value neutral while bitcoins increase in value.There is an interesting effect called Gresham's Law that says ""bad money drives out good."" What that means is that while currently both coins are trading at parity, if you were conducting commerce using both, you would tend to save in bitcoins, and spend in zitcoins. So would everyone else.So very quickly, zitcoins would become the defacto ""currency"" while bitcoins would revert to more of a ""commodity"". As the price diverged later. People would trade 1 bitcoin for 2 zitcoins, then spend them. If they received excess zitcoins they might trade them 2 for 1 to bitcoins, hoping that when the<rest of post truncated>

Topic: Tragedy of the email/discussion forum commons...
### Original post:
I wrote this three years ago, and I'd still like to see something like it implemented. Now we've got Bitcoin, implementing it might be much easier; I'd love to see a bitcoin bbs/forum that uses these ideas to reward thoughtful, high-quality discussion (replace ""email list"" everywhere below with ""discussion forum"" and I think it all still works):I was listening to ""The Ethics of Liberty"" yesterday, and it got me thinking about email lists.Most email discussion lists seem to suffer from a Tragedy of the Commons-- there's not a whole lot of motivation for people posting their opinions to think twice about spouting off, or going on and on and on, or otherwise polluting the list with stuff that the subscribers to the list might consider junk.There are a couple of solutions to these kinds of problems. You can try to set up some kind of policing system, with trusted moderators given the power to bless posts, ban people, etc. You need really thick-skinned, generous-hearted, even-tempered moderators for that to work.A solution that works in the real world that hasn't been tried for the email mailing list problem (as far as I know) is some kind of economic system, where the common resource i<rest of post truncated>

Yes Gavin, the time has come for this kind of forum, and maybe Bitcoin is the necessary enabler.I can think of a few existing systems that almost implement this idea.Answers sites such as Google Baraza or Yahoo Answers issue their own points-based ""currencies"". You get a certain number of points just for checking in every day, and you can spend those points asking questions. If you answer questions, you can earn more points, and you get even more if other people think you provided useful answers.To me the big sticking-point of your proposed system is the distribution of ""new"" forum money. How do you stop spammers and trolls signing up multiple times? If only there was a viable way to force newcomers to do ""work"" to get their initial allocation of forum money...Ah, so we just make newcomers pay a few bitcoins to get started! But the burden of that might be enough to stop the idea from taking off.If the forum has ads, that should provide a small amount of income that could buy some new bitcoins to be distributed each day. What if there was a way to identify people who had made insightful posts in OTHER places, and send the bitcoins to them so that they could participate in this forum<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 2:
What about a system where people pay to post ? 0.01BTC per word, for instance. This way people would think twice before posting.The question is : what to do with the money. It could be sent back to previous posters, proportionnaly to their amount of posting.PS. There could be a market for ""words"". It could be fun.

Topic: Distributed reputation system
### Original post:
I propose an idea for a distributed reputation system for Bitcoin. It is based on a ""marking"" of the public transaction history. Here is how it would work:Every Bitcoin transaction can be voted either positive, neutral, or negative. Only addresses directly involved in said transaction can tag said transaction. Comments can be attached to the vote.An address' reputation can be the sum of (positive votes x BTC amount) - (negative votes x BTC amount). Each address owns their own votes.Since the transaction history is public to all, transaction amounts can be easily verified. All that is needed is transaction tagging. In order to avoid coupling this functionality into Bitcoin, it should ideally be part of a standalone package and call Bitcoin externally (or at the very least, should probably not be part of the Bitcoin core API). That is why Bitcoin needs to be standardized into an API so that third-party apps such as this can be developed; I understand that JSON is a step in this direction, but it has security risks and cannot be public by default. Perhaps what is needed is a tiered approach so that public data can be publicly exposed by default, whereas the full JSON lib needs to be u<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Doh... Just thought of an easy way this can be hijacked. Someone could just create a new address, send all their bitcoins to it, and tag it with a good result...That sucks. It's going to be hard to get anonymous btc loans or other services without knowledge of rep. It's not that important for bc right now; perhaps someone has already thought about this and figured it out. Let's keep the discussion flowing, guys!

### Reply 2:
I think for the time being we can mold existing reputation systems to bitcoin.I was also looking lately at <link> web of trust which has an api that could be used to build a bitcoin specific browser tool.Maybe some kind of firefox plugin.

Topic: Everyone Calls My Child's Name Bitcoin.
### Original post:
Because of the story <link> until now most people, especially my entire extended family and also people around me, call my child Bitcoin.Actually, most of them don't really know what Bitcoin really is, especially old people and small children because in my area Bitcoin is not very popular and only certain people know about it. And with this story happening, those who know that my child's birth expenses were paid using Bitcoin, want to know more clearly and also want to know what Bitcoin actually is.And after I told them the basics of what Bitcoin is and its benefits, they finally understood and in my conversation with them I did not suggest investing, only that Bitcoin can be used for long-term investments that are profitable from other investments. And it can be used for trading, and can also be used as a transaction tool like money. And both must have a Bitcoin address or wallet that can be done privately, because in the country where I live, Bitcoin or other crypto cannot be used as a means of transaction.And until now when explaining Bitcoin I don't know the developments whether they are involved or not.Actually that's not the purpose of this thread, but more aimed at my son wh<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
You don't have to worry on that but should instead be happy and proud because your child has now become a living advertisement for Bitcoin. Certainly, many people would be curious to know why he is nicknamed as such and the story behind it. I am sad, however, that it seems to me it is hard to do cryptocurrency business in your own country. This is actually my first time to hear a story on this nature and you should be proud to be the first one in this forum. Now, am planning to get a dog and named it Bitcoin so my pet will officially be a cryptocurrency.

### Reply 2:
I see 2 points coming up:1) Your son will have to answer a hell lot of questions about the story why he is called Bitcoin, can get quite annoying quickly....2) On a more positive note he will get a lot of attention from girls, because Bitcoin sounds like a lot of money.....Same as your son is called ""Goldchain"" or so...so you should give him a decent weekly allowance so that he can live up to expectations,,,

Topic: Silly and scary questions, and what would you do if that were you.
### Original post:
I became worried and found it difficult to answer after my friend asked me scary and ridiculous questions about Bitcoin ownership.he asked. If friends, new acquaintances, or other people find out that you have a sizable amount of Bitcoin, and you don't tell them. Then you are kidnapped with several people covering their faces, with the aim of getting your wallet address with the risk that if you don't give it you will be killed.And another reason, you have given your wallet address to members you trust, such as family members or your wife and children.And I want to know, what are you going to do.Aren't you going to give the bad guy your wallet address, and you let him get killed. However, your Bitcoins remain safe because you have given your wallet address to someone you trust.Or you will give it away because you still want to live, and you don't have any more Bitcoins.And it was just a casual conversation with a friend of mine who both owns Bitcoin, and I was just wondering what other people's answers to this dreaded question made me want to create a thread.

### Reply 1:
The situation is serious because it relates to your life, you can be killed.First, don't try to make noise and let people know that you are a Bitcoin investor, have a lot of bitcoin and you are rich. It is prevention.If you already did stupid things opposite than above recommendations, you have to prepare a small wallet to gove it to bad guys when serious situation comes. Because you will be able to use that wallet, to save yourself.Even if you give them that wallet, nothing to be sure that they will free you. So let's return to first recommendation as prevention to be attacked. You will be smarter if you keep personal actitivies in secret.

### Reply 2:
I recently caught someone trying his luck with the classic scam ""privatekey bait"".My silly answer, why don't I start collecting these kinds of keys just in case? Let's say someday in a situation OP described, I'd hand over these keys to a robber. More seriously, I'd rather prevent myself from becoming a target for criminals. I thought this situation would never happen.

Happy new year everyone, I am very glad that as many of us who made it to this year made it, and hope the new year brings unimaginable blessing our way going forward.. Amen. Now, I have something I wish to share concerning the sudden crash we experienced yesterday, which saw bitcoin crash to around 40,000+ from $45,000+. Bitcoin so far have very much recovered, but Now.. What do you guys think about that sudden crash?What do you think was playing out? Do you really think it was all about Matrixport's report saying all bitcoin spot ETFs will be rejected by the SEC? No, not at all, it's all a game plan, a strategy to make us panic short and spot sell our bitcoins. In crypto, learn not to care much about sudden flash crash, as long as its bitcoin we are talking about, but care more, and be most afraid of slow bleed.. I will explain this below - read on. Investors responds to flash crash, faster than they respond to slow bleed, flash crash is a tool that is used to instigate fear, panic, causing the chicken hearted to instantly (without hesitation) dump their position(bitcoin). Flash Crash is a tool also used by market makers to flush out over-leveraged traders, and trader who are long<rest of post truncated>

Well your approach of buy, lock up, and live suggests a laid-back strategy. Instead of stressing over short-term ups and downs, you're embracing the idea that Bitcoin's value might skyrocket in the long run. It's like letting your investment ride the waves without getting too caught up in the day-to-day fluctuations. The idea is to enjoy life while trusting in Bitcoin's potential over time. Goodluck!

### Reply 2:
I appreciate the analysis but do people actually really care about this now or everybody just repeats the same old lines about bitcoin and the supposed elite who want you to short-sell so they can fill their bags?I hope that newbies come up with some fresh ideas and perspectives because these arguments have been hashed and rehashed umpteen times on the forum. I dont think anybody is out there to get your bitcoin from the common people. What the governments would really want is for those miners to just shutdown and people to stop taking bitcoin seriously. The so-called elites could not be less concerned about whatever us plebs hold. Those of them who really want to get in on the game are the ones buying up Michael Saylor's debt bonds.The market has matured enough in terms of volatility that nothing can be explained by whale actions now. The news cycle definitely affects the market just like everything else. Those who want to hold, hold. Those who want to trade the chops, do it at their own risk. There is no great conspiracy theory behind it all. Just that its an ecosystem that needs to keep running.

Truth.Personally, I'm not sure if his life sentence is justified. But dude operated a website allowing very illegal activities. His guilt was pretty damn cut and dry. It's not like he was just running a legal marketplace and people secretly used his website for illegal stuff. He knowingly built it for that illegal things.As to that being an unpopular opinion...anyone thinking that either doesn't think we should have laws or is so blinded by bitcoin that they can't see straight when talking about anything related to Bitcoin. Criminals who use Bitcoin to do criminal things are still criminals, obviously.

### Reply 2:
I mean.. he was convicted for creating and operating an online black market that facilitated illegal activities such as drug trafficking, hacking tools, and other criminal enterprises. The evidence presented during his trial demonstrated that he knowingly enabled illegal transactions, contributing to drug addiction, violence, and above all else the solicitation of murder. Ulbricht's platform provided a haven for criminal activities, undermining public safety and the rule of law. While some argue for the libertarian ideals he claimed to champion, the undeniable reality is that the Silk Road facilitated a wide range of illegal and harmful activities.It may be an unpopular opinion here on this forum..but Ross is a criminal.

Topic: Bitcoin community toolbar.
### Original post:
I found this site and thought it would be cool if the entire bitcoin ecosystem could be managed on one toolbar. <link> could provide links for all the assorted bitcoin sites as well as updating exchange prices and allow searching of every bitcoin site from one box. Everyone who has the toolbar installed could be messaged when a new version is released as well as chat to each other. A download link could be added as well as the ability to launch bitcoin from your toolbar. Mybitcoin could be added or even an address book of favourite bitcoin addresses you collect like sticky notes. Privacy and anonymizing tools could also be added for the paranoid. Could someone run a bitcoin exchange using this? A business directory?I know a lot of people dont like toolbars but the ability to have everything in one place in my browser would be attractive. Conduit also has 170 million users. A bitcoin app could also be created for the marketplace that performed similar functions...a desktop gadget for instance.

I was around for the first fork, the one true bitcoin (kidding), and then there were a ton of others (really thought bitcoin pizza was going to take off ).. but what I don't know and can't seem to find is if it's still forking a bunch like it use to? Also, if it is or did again, lets say you kept your coins on say Coinbase exchange (like a fool)..would they keep them like they use to?Thx!

### Reply 1:
I mean they are considered hard forks no? I guess I see what you mean, as to not confuse people. I'm also curious if there's ever been a soft fork.Edit: I know this is not really supposed to be brought up, but it goes hand in hand (hope mods understand) but I'm curious about all this as for say monero and ethereum as well.

### Reply 2:
I think they can't deal with the fact that they all fall under the altcoin umbrella, therefore, they target Bitcoin as an easy way out and call it a fork. What they seem not to understand is that whatever is not Bitcoin is definitely an altcoin and nothing more.The extreme move by these people have obviously not proven any productive and that has killed the trend else, we would have seen tons of projects being called Bitcoin fork.

Topic: Have you ever regretted selling your bitcoins ?
### Original post:
We've all been there, that moment of realization when you remember selling your precious Bitcoins years ago and wonder if you missed the boat. Well, take a deep breath, because im here to remind you that in the world of crypto, time is always on our side!It might sting a bit to think about what could have been if you held onto those BTC, but let's not forget the golden rule of crypto: it's a marathon, not a sprint. The market is dynamic, and opportunities are ever-present.

### Reply 1:
One thing i will say is there will always be regrets in this crypto space because of the volatility attached to it. You might be regretting why you sold early because the price went up significantly above where you sold or you might be regretting another time why you didnt sale because the price started dumping, these two are part of the space. But the best regret is always that doesnt make you to be in loss thats selling with a profit. How do one over come this i will say dont fix a time to take profit rather fix a price to take profit. If a coin gets to a price where you can take 75% holdings including some profit and maybe the invested amount too then take them. Dont sometimes be too greedy for a high pump that you leave your coins most especially if it is Altcoins. Although the most important thing is to invest in what you can afford to lose so that there wont be any regrets regardless of the decision made. Hodl bitcoin for long, take profit when necessary and you wouldnt be in regret

### Original post:
Bitcoin BRC-20 Runes are being developed and I would like to know more about them. Can anyone explain them in detail and what changes to the protocol are being proposed?Do Runes support Bitcoin's purpose to be an ""electronic cash system""?

### Reply 1:
In short they create a new one shit project that claimed to solve the high fees, but they didn't want to leave Bitcoin network. Actually the best solution to solve high fees when transferring BRC-20 token is to leave Bitcoin network.No, you're not using real Bitcoin, so there's no support or contribution to Bitcoin.There are many projects that support Bitcoin to be a currency e.g. lightning network, rootstock etc.

Topic: Bitcoin + ChatRoulette
### Original post:
I realize ChatRoulette hasn't met the expectations it was generating in the winter of 2010, but it is still a top 10,000 website. I think bitcoin would be a good fit for ChatRoulette: it allows 'viewers' to reward 'performers' anonymously (I'm thinking card tricks and piano improv here, not what you guys are thinking).Andrey Ternovskiy could skim his percentage from each transaction and finally have a way of monetizing his monster.

### Reply 1:
Exactly. Is it possible to enter some text on your ChatRoulette profile page or something...? Where you could post your Tip Jar Bitcoin Address...?I just now added ChatRoulette to the <link> page. Keep those suggested ideas for sites / merchants / organizations which should accept Bitcoin coming! Also, you can help out by emailing me with more details to fill out the ""details fields"" that are missing information too. Thanks!

### Reply 2:
ChatRoulette doesn't have profiles as it is anonymous. Which makes bitcoin such a suitable match. Perhaps some sort of browser extension could handle the needed technology, but ideally it would be built in to ChatRoulette itself so that it received wide exposure.I think the founder and investors have been having a difficult time monetizing ChatRoulette... here is a solution for them.

Topic: Wallet suggestions?
### Original post:
Hello friends!I have been keeping my cryptocurrencies (I still don't have many, unfortunately) on the Binance exchange.What type of virtual wallet do you use? And what are the best ways for me to keep my cryptocurrencies safe?Sorry if it seems like a stupid question, but even though I reasonably understand crypto, I'm still taking my first steps with bitcoin.

### Reply 1:
Ledger or Trezor are not bad, and above all they are better than leaving your funds in Binance, but they implement anti-privacy policies and ledger is mostly poop. Passport is better but it is more expensive than the cheaper Ledger or Trezor models. The choice between less bad and cheap would be the Trezor model 1.

### Reply 2:
Binance is a centralized exchange in which you do not have full control of your asset, should anything happen to the platform your funds will be lost, there are also other restrictions that exchanges have. Using an exchange to keep funds is like leaving your stuffs in a marketplace. The best form of holding or storing your coins is to be your own bank thats keeping your funds in self custodial wallet, there you have your wallet keys to yourself; not your keys not your coins. Now there are many type of custodial wallets but the best is the open source wallets and also an offline wallet like an hardware wallet or an airgapped wallet set with any software wallet. Here is break down of wallets and categories you can choose from For privacy: use bitcoin core and run your own node. For cold wallet; you can use hardware wallet (Trezor or passport) or an airgapped device with electrum as the wallet For hot wallet: use electrum, BlueWallet and Sparrow (they have both mobile and desktop versions) Also it is worth mentioning that the even after making a choice of wallet one important thing is how you keep your seed phrase or private key safe, a good and safe wallet is complimented by keeping <rest of post truncated>

Topic: Bitcoin Rated 6th Among the Top Global Currencies
### Original post:
source At global monetary value, bitcoin is top 6th using the analysis of market capitalization while comparing to other existing fiat currencies, this is a significant difference that makes bitcoin be among the top rated because of it's unique value and increasing rate of adoption as the market cap continues to surge ahead other long term existing fiat currencies.We had this happening even before the great occasion of the 2024 halving began when bitcoin break the first ever recorded of $1 trillion dollars, while it could be recalled that it was after the previous 2020 halving it marked it's all time market cap high, unlike having the experience right before the halving begun this time, this also shows a significant increase in adoption and how bitcoin have been seen as a preferred digital currency or investment asset globally.Bitcoin has come to stay, invest today and hodl.

### Reply 1:
Firstly, thanks for the informationThe significant rise in Bitcoin investments at both the individual and institutional levels has helped Bitcoin see a rise in prices.After the halving, these requirements will be reduced by half: with only 3,125 BTC mined per block, equivalent to a drop to $7 billion per year, effectively relieving selling pressure.The price of Bitcoin directly affects the operational costs of the mining community. As a result, Bitcoin miners are anticipating the upcoming halving event, which will halve the mining reward to 3,125 BTC.

### Reply 2:
Thanks OP for sharing such a useful information, In term of currency Bitcoin proved it's value. It is just start and still lots of adoption remained which will be happened in future. There are still some countries where btc buying selling are not allowed. In next five years I hope analysis will show btc at top 3 in term of adoption. According to coinmarketcap, Bitcoin total marketcap is now 1.02 trillion which is currently no 10 in term of assets. Gold is on the top with 13 trillion marketcap. BTC is close to surpass Meta(Facebook) and Silver which could be happened after halving (maybe thos Year or next). It is big victory for Bitcoin lovers who are supporting from the start.

Topic: Prepare for the Next Dip before the Real Bull.
### Original post:
The time to purchase has come again. Many can't buy because of the hike of price but it is coming down again for you to start your investment and there should be no excuse this time and this is a quick reminder to those who were procrastinating their investment plan because of the hike of price. Now there are different ways for you to aquire some unit of bitcoin into your wallet before the real bull time. Now that the price is coming use DCA to aquire the unit you want, with the DCA you are not buy all at once but just a percentage every week so that even you Buy on this because it is coming and don't wait until the dip or the bottom, you don't know what will happen.And hodle to get there on the bull time.

### Reply 1:
What I see happening to the market is just a price correction. Bitcoin has used the ETF new and the up coming halving for the market hype, which was among the factors that contributed to the price of bitcoin going up due to the high volume of accumulation that people were acquiring.Now that the ETF has been approved, the market has reacted in the opposite direction, which was not what many expected, and many have also sold out their holdings, taking profit from what they bought earlier before the market went up, so the market is just trying to correct itself before we can start seeing a real positive price again. Adding to the fact that miners are on their selling mode in the past few days, the market have every reason to drop down for now we might even see more of this in the coming days.

### Reply 2:
The market started dropping unexpectedly and those who are on leverage trading will definitely get their money liquidated if they dont act fast. This is really the best time for those who want to buy and hold for long to dive into the market and stop their procrastination but we still cant tell how far this market is going to drop before it will recover back to the top again, and even as the halving is behind the corner their is no guarantee that immediately after the halving that we will see any increase in market price, so even as the price is down for now and one still want to DCA they should use what they can afford to lose and what they wont be needing any time soon incase the market still happen to see a new face of dip they will not be too much affected by the price change.

Topic: You should use a 12 or 24 words seed phrase ?
### Original post:
This is a very important topic that I want to comment on, since lately I see a lot of confusion on it on Twitter and in other platforms about Whats the difference between a 12 word seed phrase and a 24 word seed phrase? Many people simply have a basic preference or default wallet. For some, like me, the issue goes further, and is about security, i will try to summarise it as quite as posible. I will split this topic in three parts: 12 words seed phrase , 24 words seed phrase and finally the scrambled Seed Words. Note: SP will stand to seed phrase.12 Words SP<link> if you are wondering wich words are in the BIP39 list here its is a llink to check it by yourself.<link> number of posible combinations exceeds 2.6 undecillion potential pairings. This implies that in order to calculate all of the potential 12-word SP that exist, someone would have to predict all 2.6 undecillion permutations, quite a heavy proces to be honest. 24 Words SP<link> you see 14 <truncated> possible word combinations, its the first time you heard it, i know....Astronimcal number, although guessing a 24-word seed phrase is not impossible in theory, we can described as ""practically impossible."" In other words, giv<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
12 words provide 128 bits of entropy.24 words provide 256 bits of entropy.It means 24 words are safer in security than 12 words, 256 bits of entropy compares to 128 bits of entropy. 24 words are more secure than 12 words.Because Bitcoin private key provides 128 bits of entropy, 12 words for your seed phrase is enough.Don't mix/ rearrange your word orders, it will complicate your recovery process and you have risk to lose your coins.How to back up a seed phrase?Bitcoin Q&A: Why is Seed Splitting a Bad Idea?

### Reply 2:
Although, technically, 256 bits of entropy means higher level of unpredictability than 128 bits of entropy, generally speaking, they're both secure enough to protect your funds. What's left to make sure of is that you won't leak it, whether half of it, whether disarranged. I guess the problem most of the time is not the number of words in your seed phrase but how you safekeep them. Nobody has ever brute-force attack even a 12-word seed phrase.And, if I may add, a random passphrase provides additional protection.

Topic: New US Ruling deems most altcoins, if not all are securities
### Original post:
Is this the beginning of the end for the Crypto Casino? As Michael Saylor predicted this day would come sooner or later. Thank God I don't but if I had any money in altcoins I would dump them all immediately for Bitcoin because this ruling may lead to a market crash. .I wouldn't be caught dead playing around with any altcoin, especially not now. New ruling in SECs Coinbase insider trading lawsuit comes as a blow to the crypto industry as judge finds secondary token sales were securitiesMarch 3, 2024 at 11:17 AM<link>

### Reply 1:
If SEC. Chairman Gensler can not answer the question, is Ethereum a security or a commodity, it does not make sense that SEC. under his term, tries to suit other cryptocurrencies as securities.We need new laws as the current laws which is already outdated and new laws must be passed by US. government. SEC. should not over use their power and they should try to do their main task on Security, not on cryptocurrency.Look at Gensler <link>

### Reply 2:
The ruling doesnt declare that most altcoins are tokens, only a narrow set of specific tokens, although this could have implications for centralized altcoins such as Ripple. Previously, Ripple was only considered a security when its issuers were selling tokens directly to institutional investors. Now it can also be considered a security if it is being sold on exchanges like Coinbase. There is still several other lawsuits in progress and the rulings in those cases could end up being in conflict with each other and higher courts will need to get involved to sort it all out.

What extra hooks could be put into the Bitcoin chain to be able to add extra kinds of data into that chain?In theory there is the potential to put in additional message types beyond transaction and block messages to the whole <truncated> sequence. Some of these blocks could in theory be other kinds of data such as a stock exchange purchase or the DNS data that has been talked about.Where I see a problem is coming up with the algorithms to be able to process these extra kinds of data and getting them accepted into Bitcoin directly. Bitcoin simply isn't that flexible at the moment. There certainly are no hooks for processing those extra kind of data and verifying if they conform to some sort of standard or not or even identifying who might be involved in establishing those verification standards.It could get there. There might be ways to work Bitcoin up to put this extra data into the chain, but is that something which Satoshi is going to accept? I really don't know either way.I know you can shove all kinds of random garbage into the Transaction blocks that has nothing at all to do with Bitcoin balance transactions.

I agree, but that implies theymos is also full of it when he says that any new project requiring a block chain is going to fail, as there are other projects which need a block chain. The role of the block chain is more than merely timestamping, but also to cryptographically certify the integrity of that data. It is precisely for that reason which the data is desired to be put into the chain as a way to identify tampering with that data, not merely as a storage medium.Another is to find some way to utilize the technology of Bitcoins in some other application that doesn't involve necessarily digital currency but provide some method to use Bitcoins as a financial incentive to participate. So far the choice is to create a separate block and currency system or put that in with hooks and using Bitcoins as a data storage system. If you know a third choice, I'm totally open to the idea.Another possible alternative is a flat out fork of the project altogether and a schism of the community where these hooks are put in as I've described. I don't think that is desired either.As to if WIkileaks documents qualify as something needing to be both timestamped and having been cryptographically secur<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Too many unknown variables and not enough input (about what you exactly mean by that), but the answer is most likely: NO.Or at least not anytime soon.Else everyone would do it and therefore (again) wouldn't pay for itself.

### Reply 2:
Perhaps if your electricity is otherwise free to use, such as you live in Canada and only have electro-resistive heat anyway, but you are probably still talking about a 7+ year ROI. Otherwise your average time for ROI would probably be longer than your lifetime, and might approach infinity.

Thank you very much, honestly, I was a bit nervous bringing it up, but I had the same thought as you... ""It doesn't cost anything"". Why not try?Hey hey hey, my exchange & faucet supports CLAM!!!

I then do my best to explain I listed the coins in alphabetical order and C comes before M... sigh. LOL, poor misgendered cat!! I'd just nickname him ""peachers"". It sounds more masculine . My plan is to use the cryptocurrency donated as a ""nest egg"" for the future. This shelter has a Board that is really high quality, so fiat isn't a huge deal at the moment. Also, all of the fundraisings for the shelter are done in fiat, so that stuff is already accounted for over the past 20 years of their existence. If shit absolutely hit the fan... I'm sure the cryptocurrency could be traded for gift cards (likely for a discount too) for supplies and fiat for employee wages, but right now it's a nest egg for the future. The Shelter could really use a new building and they are wanting to build a ""Spay/Neuter Clinic"" as well<rest of post truncated>

Topic: Using bit coins as negotiable, verifiable, warehouse receipts
### Original post:
It seems that the principle of bitcoin is to track transactions and that it is possible for anyone to review the ""transaction history"". If that is the case, then is there any reason why bit coins couldn't double as digital warehouse receipts? Suppose you deposit 100 oz of gold with me and in exchange I give you 100 bit coins with a ""repurchase agreement"" in place where I will buy back the ""same"" 100 bit coins for 100 oz of gold. The fact that the coins ""left"" a designated account and have not yet returned to that account means that they are ""backed by gold"". With some standard and published ""addresses"" and some ""even/odd"" counting it should be possible to independently verify whether a coin is backed by gold and *who* is doing the backing without checking in with a the warehouse. Is there something about the bitcoin implementation that would prevent this kind of usage?I posted this in another topic and was told that the coins were truly fungible and thus there was no reliable way to achieve such a result with the current implementation. I suspect that some individuals more familiar with the design / implementation and constraints could identify if it would be *possible* to design a<rest of post truncated>

Another thought comes to mind, anonymous transfer of messages. If you can send someone a bitcoin or a bit note why not enable anonymous p2p communication via your bitcoin addresses? Perhaps I am barking up the wrong tree here. One of the problems with e-mail is that even though you can encrypt the message, the source/destination are still public knowledge and you must register an e-mail address with a known server. So imagine if every transaction included a ""message field"" that could contain arbitrary data. Transaction fees (in bitcoin) would automatically manage resources by rewarding the node that delivered the message to the destination. I suspect that this may expose a weakness in bitcoin if there is no effective means of purging ""old data"".I suspect that using bitcoins as a means to allocate P2P network resources would create demand! And users providing those resources would then provide the supply! As more people wish to use the p2p network the demand for bitcoins would go up which would cause their monetary value to increase and thus the number of people setting up p2p nodes!

Topic: JP Morgan says BTC price could drop after 2024 halving
### Original post:
History has shown us that Bitcoin's market price goes up after each halving. But this time's different. Especially when institutional investment companies are buying up most of the circulating supply. BTC reached a new ATH right before the anticipated halving event of April 2024. Prices are going up, and everybody's happy. But what if there's a big market correction once the hype ends? According to JP Morgan, Bitcoin could go down to the $40k range after the halving craze is over. So we'll be seeing the inverse effect of what used to happened before spot ETFs became a thing in the crypto industry. You can read all about it here: <link> do you think of Bitcoin's current situation? Will it retain ATHs after the halving? Or will there be a massive bloodbath in market prices? Do you think the halving is already priced in? What would you do? Sell or keep ""hodling""? Your input would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

### Reply 1:
If history repeats and often it does, the price goes up right after halving but will be then soon followed by a bear run. I think we can blame this on investors taking their profits after a whopping bull run Calling this all hype is an understatement. Yes, it will go down but take this as an opportunity to keep buying bitcoin as I am sure it will also keep increasing even after a bear run

### Reply 2:
when JPmorgan wants people to sell he will be the one buyingwhen JPmorgan wants people to buy he will be the one sellinghe WANTS people to sell now to get the price down again before 2025 so he can buy cheap coin before the 2025 (pattern) next ATH trigger yearso when he says it can go down he wants people to sell now to make people become the trigger of a fall.. thus create a self fulfilling prophecy.. so he can buy at a discount to current prices

It may be difficult for any nation to build up these stockpiles in secret, but even so, the race has already begun. No matter who wins it, its Bitcoin that will be on top in the end. unfortunately it would appear that the usa governments hands are dirty and it has stolen peoples bitcoins, confiscated them, throwing people in jail and all kinds of things. enjoy your bitcoins you buy from uncle sam because it is blood money...

What a nice new regulations by US government, this will make them able to earn Bitcoin for free! without need to spend a lot time and effort to claim every hour.However, I wonder why when it comes to Bitcoin seizures, it's always be US that handle it? each country has it's own Bitcoin regulations, Bitcoin isn't a currency that can be used in there. I know there were few news about Bitcoin seizures in other countries and it's the local police that handle it, but there are related to clear cases e.g. scam and ponzi scheme.

### Reply 2:
lol...stolen?? They literally confiscate it from criminals, people either who did illegal stuff to get bitcoin or who stole the bitcoin themselves. ""throwing people in jail""...yeah cuz they were criminals who got caught. Very bizarre narrative you're trying to make.Anyway I'm sure they will eventually sell all the bitcoin they have, as they always do. Or in the case of retrieving bitcoin from hackers presumably they will go through the courts to hand those bitcoin back to the people they were stolen from.

Who are on the list of richest in the world are always powerful. They can even change anything of a country if they wish. They have the power of politics. They may be asked for advice on taking the country forward or on major policies of the country. So we can say they are the most powerful it can be directly or indirectly. Some may think that their attraction is not for getting the power but to increase their wealth. Whatever, It is now not confined to one place but is now engaged in a competitive behavior which will increase as long as the world exists.SourceIt will not be very difficult to guess who can be the most ahead in this competition in the future world. I have been seeing a lot of rich people collecting bitcoin lately and there is a big competition to collect bitcoin among the recognized rich internationally. Now the day is not so far when the top several company owner all over the world will also be defeated by the BTC holder.Bitcoin is now a weapon with which only he can maintain his power in this space.I have seen several individuals who are the top bitcoin holders. They are: Michael SaylorJustin SunTyler Winklevoss & Cameron Winklevoss Jack DorseyChangpeng Zhao (CZ)B<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
Of course Op one way or the other man can hold bitcoin for future use, it also a means of investment for some business men, but not all are capable of doing such.The way things are going round now, crypto currency has become special and a very attractive source of making cool money.Not only the business men even though the most countries have fully engaged themselves into it.Now it is a lesson to us all, if you can make a view from far you can see the most richest men in the world are into crypto racing, still making money not by relying on the whole wealth they are having, what about we should also have that same patience of holding Bitcoin. I think we can also find ourselves on the list one day.

### Reply 2:
Net worth is not a very good metric. I can imagine that during the Bitcoin ATH some top holder will get close to the level of the richest people in the world, but so what? They can't liquidate all their coins for that value, and they will probably won't liquidate any big amount and will keep hodling, just like those rich people don't liquidate their stocks.

Topic: Request for data: top 5 blocks which include the highest count of transactions
### Original post:
Can I ask you for the advice, please? I need to find the top 5 blocks which include the highest number of transactions. Is there a webiste (blockchain explorer) where I could find an answer, perhaps?

### Reply 1:
The top two blocks are atypical though, and both (nearly correlative) blocks present anomalies such as those shown here. Notice the existence of thousands of TXs included in the block such as this one, with no inputs nor outputs.There is an approach to a certain explanation provided here, though theres probably a better description if we look around a bit more:<link> other blocks on the list seem to be blocks that included many Ordinal BTC-20 related TXs, especially those from September 2023: Block 806264 for example had 91,8% of TXs being Ordinal related, block 806249 84,8%, block 806280 91,6%, and so forth.

### Reply 2:
Thanks. Strangely enough, the Blockchair website is not reachable from some of networks that I connect to.

Topic: Minting service contracts
### Original post:
Following what Babylon said in here, here is another idea directly related to the money supply. Other people would want to create other systems like BitCoin. Well, how about BitCoin having a feature called ""minting service contracts""?A minting service contract would be an XML which describes how a minting service can integrate with the BitCoin network. Basically, rather than having lots of software applications (which would have to be trusted) which do the same thing as BitCoin but with slightly different protocols and numbers, use just one (BitCoin) and let users import minting service contract XMLs (into their BitCoin client).Each XML describes how the minting service works, what the protocol parameters are and basically how the coin creation is initialized. This way, they can all live within the BitCoin network, but it remains to the users to decide which minting services to use.This allows the entire network to increase the money supply (of course, with different types of currency), gets rid of voting and doesn't ""force"" users to use a specific currency.

### Reply 1:
I think that the *real feature* provided by bitcoin is transaction verification. So all that needs to be done is extend the ""transaction"" data structure to include a ""what"" field. Thus anyone could create any kind of ""Currency"" and have transactions verified by the bitcoin swarm.

### Reply 1:
It's interesting to see that this article from cointelegraph about the $64k worth of inscriptions eluding that the encrypted data inscribed is designed to flush out Satoshi's identity. How so, they did not really describe too well, other than hinting that breaking this code would enable someone to find out intel about Satoshi.Maybe, it is a seed for the future for once this encryption can be broken, containing information about the identity of Satoshi? I can't say that I'm not curious about the contents myself, and it will be interesting to watch if anyone manages to crack it.

Too early in the year for me to consume Ayre conspiracy theories but given the willingness of many coin-laden individuals in the past to sink fortuitous gains into pursuits of fame, I wouldn't be surprised.And yes.

Topic: Hashing slowdown
### Original post:
I've noticed that after running Bitcoin for a while, the hashing seems to slow down by a significant amount.For example:310 khash/sec -> 250 -260 khash/sec2450 khash/sec -> 2150 khash/secNoticed on two seperate machines, in Windows and Ubuntu. Any idea why this could be happening? Has anyone else noticed this?

### Reply 1:
I think an increased difficulty just means more hashes are (typically) required to create a block successfully. I don't think it should slow the actual hashing rate though... my guess would be that it's something on the client's host that is consuming extra cycles and depriving bitcoin of CPU time.

### Reply 2:
That is correct.And thiscould also be correct. All newer CPU'S start throttling down their speed if they recognize a high temperature. It's a safety feature.So mabye that's your problem. Try reading you CPUs temperature sensor out (I recommend CoreTemp) and tell us what temperatures you have when the hashing slows down.

I was thinking today while driving around that it would be cool when you went through a tollbooth if they scanned your vehicle and it paid your toll for you with bitcoin! Also I just got a $20 fine for going through a place where I didnt realise you had to pay a toll.They must have scanned the number plate on my car. That also made me think of ways it could be done with bitcoin. Paying for parking fees and other things would also be easier. If someone had a bitcoin number plate you could donate to them for good/considerate driving . What else could the benefit with this?

### Reply 1:
You could also use bumper stickers I think a prefilled wallet for metered payments would be sweet.

### Reply 2:
License plate with BC address: +1, we don't have the customized plates here, and I don't think it's legal to add anything resembling a license plate, but it still is pretty cool As for paying your toll with bitcoins, how would they be able to subtract the coins from you, based on your address? Unless it's a service mybitcoin provides...

### Original post:
Maybe this is something that has been discussed before, but, what if a government, any government really, for any reason, decided to take down the bitcoin network or simply DOS the hell out of it ?My calculation might be incredibly naive, but if I take the figures from bitcoinwatch[1], and fiddle a bit with the bitcoin calculator[2] :- Right now (block 88894), 180 blocks generated during last 24h- that's a block every 8 minutes on average- average of 8 minutes for block generation would require 25 ghashes/sSo if my logic isn't flawed, the network as a whole crunches at approximately 25,000 mhashes/sSo, that's 42 Radeon 5970 graphic cards if i take the advertised figures here[3].So anyone with a little spare money (let's say 100k$) can successfully :1. generate at full speed with tweaked client,2. stop right after difficulty increase, significantly slowing down the block generation and transaction handling3. repeat after difficulty decrease,4. sell generated coins,5. increase crunching power6. finish by undermining trust in bitcoins, (advertise your attack, refuse to include transaction in generated blocks etc.)I don't think there's much incentive for regular people to donate CPU ti<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
With more people, myself included, doing dedicated mining on GPUs, this will become more difficult, now that an OpenCL miner has been made public.Also, if we get to the point where we've got that much notice from the government, we'll have bigger problems.

### Reply 2:
There is a problem with that. Once BTC goes mainstream, this will happen:- 75% of people won't even notice such notice- 20% of people will, but still won't give a fuck about helping the network OR won't understand what it is about- 2% will read the notice and turn generating on, but then turn it off later and forget about it.- Remaining 3% will be either the people wanting to help the network OR miners.So IMHO it is very important to do it by default. The 75% casual computer users won't mind it. Things work this way everywhere.

### Original post:
It suddenly occured to me, while I was trying to get my work clothes washed while at work (mildly hazardous environment means that work clothes never go home to intermingle with family clothes, but company only supplies one washer and dryer per business unit, so I had to find out who left his clothes in the washer for the past four hours) that a laundrymat that uses bitcoins instead of quarters could be lower maintaince and lower initial costs than the current coin operated type. The coin acceptance devices that are added to the washers and dryers are fairly expensive due to complexity, and subject to mechanical failures. However, all that it really takes to control the washer or dryer is a set of contacts in line with the start/run circut and perhaps a small display to impart information such as credit and time remaining. These are simple requirements in line with the smallest of microcontrollers, or a central server could control an entire room full of such machines.The same could be applied to just about any coin operated automated exchange process, such as a vending machine; but a vending machine is vastly more complex and likely cannot completely replace the coin acceptance wi<rest of post truncated>

Topic: What if authorities launch a tax for owning bitcoin?
### Original post:
It's just YouTube, but today I ran across a video that mentioned a bitcoin HODL tax.In order to stop bitcoin, authorities would have to shut down the internet which is impossible. So I predict that their next move is to launch enormous taxes to discourage people from owning bitcoin, and prevent mass adoption as competition for their corrupted CBDC's that still have to be launched. The purpose of their regulations is to take over the entire bitcoin market, of course. They will make you sell, either by launching huge taxes for ownership or by treating the owner of 1 BTC like a drug dealer (prison sentence). So we need a gameplan against this.Can we be exposed to taxation or legal penalties when the wallet is reported as stolen? I think not, but I want to be sure. I don't think you can pay taxes on something you do not officially own.

Unless you use a DEX to swap and exchange bitcoin for other coins like Monero and then use another wallet to buy and receive bitcoin, the wallet will still be linked to the address that you send it to. If you ever want to trace that transaction, let's not forget that it's a public blockchain and transactions can be tracked by anyone who has access to the address on the blockchain.There are means to clean up coins that you have already bought from the centralized exchange; either you can exchange them anonymously or you can send them back to the centralized exchange where you bought them and exchange them back to Fiat, where you can later use the fiat to buy from Dex P2P, where one will know what the funds were used for and only you will know what address and the amount of bitcoin that you hold.

It is pertinent to note that all these unscrupulous shenanigans by government and its arms are just a way of getting at Bitcoiners and they are only enjoying their limited time as Bitcoin gradually gains adoption. Uoon massive adoption, people will prefer to use Bitcoin thereby activating its peer-to-peer feature which entirely eliminates the government from interfering or taxing transactions that doesn't involve their traditional finance systems.

Topic: Did you already break the Elliptic Curve, Satoshi, you there?
### Original post:
I have been exploring the intricacies of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for several years. My interest stems from a skepticism about the ubiquitous use of ECC, which, while currently deemed secure, is susceptible to the relentless advancement of time and technology that historically challenges cryptographic methods.During my research, I analyzed a collection of public keys attributed to Satoshi Nakamoto. Upon plotting these keys on an elliptic curve, I observed a curious pattern, as shown here: <link> struck me as extraordinary was the apparent orderly generation of these public keys. They seem to follow a sequential arrangement along the X-axis, with corresponding values on the Y-axis that collectively form a discernible shape on the curve. This discovery is baffling, as generating public keys in such a precise and ordered manner on an elliptic curve is, to my knowledge, an incredibly challenging, if not impossible feat. I have thoroughly investigated this phenomenon but have yet to find an explanation.This pattern has led me to ponder several possibilities:- Could it be possible that Satoshi had found a way to 'break' the elliptic curve as early as 2009?- Is there a chance tha<rest of post truncated>

### Reply 1:
I've attached the data related to our discussion here: <link> Regarding the elliptic curve model, it's interesting to note its similarity to models used in the telecom industry, particularly in the context of public key distribution on elliptic curves. This approach focuses on extracting relevant data by targeting the center of each cluster. This method's resemblance to techniques used in companies like Ericsson leads me to wonder if Satoshi might have a background in the telecom sector.

### Reply 2:
The distribution of public keys on an elliptic curve might naturally exhibit certain patterns or clusters. This is not indicative of any weakness or manipulation but rather a consequence of how these keys are mathematically generated and distributed across the curve. The specific characteristics of the elliptic curve used in ECC (e.g., curve parameters) might influence the distribution of public keys in a certain manner. This influence might manifest as an observable pattern when a large set of keys is plotted graphically.In any large set of data, especially cryptographic data, there can be statistical anomalies that appear significant but are actually coincidental.

Topic: Generated coins just appeared?
### Original post:
Hello,I ran briefly on doublec's pooled server for awhile and then moved to slush's current service. I have never received a payout from doublec's server (didn't expect one, was just getting my feet wet setting things up) and as I understood how it worked, the payout would come in on a specific received address if I understood correctly.I have received payouts successfully from slush, but just noticed in my BTC client I have 0.09 generated BTC incoming when I have not been generating in the client itself, only via pooled services. What would cause this? Screen attached.

### Reply 1:
The server was shutdown 17 Dec though, and I'm just now showing this from today?

### Reply 2:
Sure enough...Did not expect this for how little I ran on the doublec server and that it has been shutdown for days now. Oh well, something is more than nothing, thanks for finding that!Here's the link for the specific address I was using to generate...Sure enough confirmed.<link>

Topic: How do cryptocurrency increase the standard of living
### Original post:
Knowing fully well that there is so many uneducated people around the world, how can cryptocurrency increase the standard of living

### Reply 1:
Your standard of living can only improve from cryptocurrency, when you invested wisely in a good cryptocurrency like bitcoin and have profited heavily from it, Otherwise cryptocurrency even bitcoin is not a magic wand against poverty and low standard of living. @OP to profit from bitcoins, you really need to be patient and disciplined, the Investment benefits of bitcoins in terms of profit is not instant.

### Reply 2:
Apart from investing in cryptocurrency, Op can also improve their standard of living by learning a skill that will allow them earn in cryptocurrency. While earning from cryptocurrency, you can invest some and by so doing the standard of your living will improve. Another method also is by rendering services and getting paid in cryptocurrency, although this will also require to learn skills. But in all, cryptocurrency is not a get rich quick scheme. This does not mean that you cannot become an overnight rich man with cryptocurrency. There are some altcoins and shitcoins which are very volatile. They could make drastic increase and plunge one into richness, but at the same time, it can also vanish your capital. That is why those kind of coins are not recommended for newbies who has no/little knowledge of how things work here.Above all, increasing standard of living lies in ones hands to do whether or without cryptocurrency. This is because there are people in cryptocurrency for years and yet there standard of living hasn't improved.

Topic: The Relationship Between Cryptocurrency and Traditional Banking
### Original post:
Hello everyone a very good day you all. So, lets talk about this interesting duo: cryptocurrency and traditional banking. Some say traditional banks are threatened by cryptos rise, while others think theyre starting to see the potential and hopping on the bandwagon. Either way, its a fascinating dynamic to watch unfold. What do you think? Are they destined for a happily ever after or is this just a temporary fling? Let me know your thoughts on this.

### Reply 1:
When you talk about cryptocurrency, the first coin that comes in mind is Bitcoin. Without doubt bitcoin is the king of cryptocurrency and bitcoin was created by satoshi. In bitcoin whitepaper, Satoshi stated the reasons he created bitcoin and the problems that bitcoin will solve. He didn't in anyway mention that he was creating something that will displace the traditional fiat system, rather he created an alternative to the failing and highly centralized fiat system. It started like a joke but today bitcoin is a strong voice in the financial system.But one thing is obtainable in every new technology and that is evolvement. Satoshi didn't anticipate the way Bitcoin went and when the government saw the potential of bitcoin, they rose against it on the reason of high energy consumption. The allegations could not hinder bitcoin but more and more industries were adopting bitcoin. When the government truly understood the power of decentralization and blockchain, they decided to join the bandwagon. Now different countries have their CBDCs and you cannot own a CBDC as a country and still fight against cryptocurrency. It will be a gross contradiction. So, the relationship we seek between cr<rest of post truncated>

Well, these individuals with this mindset are those that are threatened by control adopting Bitcoin rids them of. Imagine when you are in control of the finance of many and all of a sudden, there comes a different and better way by which these monies can be stored, I'm sure you'd oppose it. What's there to feel threatened about, if it's privacy you seek while doing transactions, Bitcoin is the best bet but the government don't want that cause you have brushed the power they have over you to the curb and this is why they spread do much FUD to chase people away.In life, there's always going to be choices and Satoshi by introducing Bitcoin presented an alternative way to store money but there's still going to be those who'd prefer the devil they know to the angel they don't.

Brain wallet are not secure, do not use it anymore. If you want to generate wallet, use HD wallet like Electrum or Sparrow.You can use <link> offline. For offline usage: <link> you access the it, click on brain wallet and paste your password to get your private key and see your address. The private key starts from 5, K or L.After you get the 5 prifix private key and not matching your address, try to check compressed and click on 'view' again to get the K or L private key and see if your address is correct with the address it generates you.Download Electrum from <link> After you setup electrum, click on import bitcoin addresses or private keys and paste the private key there. Let the wallet synchronize with the blockchain and check your balance.
